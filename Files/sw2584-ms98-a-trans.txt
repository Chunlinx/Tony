          okay do you go camping very much   no ive havent gone camping in years but its something that ive done in the past how about you   uh we try to go once maybe twice a summer uh   well that thats pretty avid to me   we uh just you know for like a short weekend or something we dont go for the long you know week long thing   uhhum   but uh we usually go to uh a lake area you know where the campsites are and do that uh   right do you tent camp or do you have a camper   oh no no no a tent   thats what i i you know thats how i camp too thats how i define camping  the rest of the rest of that is really really not the same as a matter of fact my my my   me me too  youre really roughing it yeah   you know the majority of the amount of camping ive done has been really roughing it um as a little girl id go with my dad and my uncle and my brother and we went to the Boundary Waters area in Minnesota so   oh   thats thats really wild   yeah are you here in local Texas i mean   yes im in Austin where are you   im in Garland   oh   right outside of Dallas so we um we have a five year old and we started taking her she was pretty young when we started uh camping with her   uhhuh oh the kids love they they just love it its wonderful for them to be outside   i know i know i know and then they and they you know theres no TV and they dont have all these modern toys and they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like that to play with   exactly yes   and i like that its pretty fun   well how it really is a good a good family thing to do yeah  and   umhum yeah we we try to uh go with another couple that have children also and uh that makes it a lot more enjoyable plus you know we dont have to go out and buy all the equipment and stuff you know we kind of split it up uh   umhum good planning   yeah  because it gets it really does get expensive if you if if you dont want to rough it all the way   exactly   you know even with sleeping bags those are running you know good thirty dollars a pop and so weve built that up but no want one bad do you   youre right youre right do you have a boat no oh i well actually i would you know what i would love i would absolutely love a sail boat that doesnt go along with camping but now that that thats what i would like to have   oh yeah yes i would too   yeah   would too we usually uh like i said we try to go to a lake my husband and this uh other couple that we go with her husband um they like to um is it scuba dive and so well go to a lake and uh  where they can go do that were close enough so they can do that and the girls can play on the beach area  okay   umhum and i wanna play on the beach area too thats what i would do you know  im just sitting here listening listening to your accent and thinking what a good time the computers going to have with that   yes yes thats fun really  am i pretty Texan   youre pretty Texan yes but you know you know whats really funny um ive had people tell me that i have a Texas accent and i mean there just is no way ive not picked one up   no you dont you dont sound like it to me   ive only lived here about six years so if if if i have one it must be very very slight but  the Yankees can hear it     yes yes oh well thats true thats true i see i dont think i do but um but a lot of people do say i sound like i guess i have i guess more of a twang to my voice but sure am ive lived here all my life but anyway uh   umhum are you a a native Texan oh well good for you have you ever been to Austin   yes yes we went last summer actually   there how was im wondering im really not that familiar i know therere some good places to go camping along the uh the lakes   oh is there okay well we didnt go camping we just uh we did like um we drove down to Houston to visit friends and went went to Galveston and uh to San Antonio and then up to Austin and and kind of uh you know doing the sight seeing type   umhum   stuff so we didnt go camping that would be fun though to go thats one thing my husband wanted to do was on this summers vacation was to go and camp wherever we went       and i said well id love that but   it takes a lot more planning   it does and and ever once you know on my summer vacation you know my week long vacation i want to be a little bit pampered you know by a hotel or whatever   umhum right exactly exactly yeah   so were hoping to do like a three day weekend theres um a thing called Pfeiffer Rim i dont know if youve ever heard of it   no i havent   its uh theres a town called Glenrose i think its around two hours from here and uh its got it has like dinosaur tracks   oh that sounds   and stuff like that and its got one of those wildlife parks   that sounds great   yeah i think thatll be fun so were going to try to do that like

it then i felt like we roughed it then   yeah uh well we did well we did you know we really did i mean i just dont understand these people that think taking an RV and parking it and sitting inside and watching TV and having your microwave its not camping   right yes exactly i mean we had to make the fires and dig latrines and everything   exactly right right i mean that is it   you have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff to really be camping  yeah well do you you havent say you havent been in years   right  oh no i havent im um im a struggling single mom and um yeah thank you um its
