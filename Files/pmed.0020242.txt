                            It doesnt take a trained physician to know that a disease needs to be diagnosed to be        treated And it doesnt take an economist to know that a disease cannot be diagnosed if the        required tools are unaffordable or impractical The absence of early diagnosis and        treatment is particularly problematic for infectious disease where the lack of early        treatment or isolation can result in an epidemic        Given the technological requirements diagnosis and monitoring of HIV infection is        problematic in resourcepoor areas The advent of rapid tests for diagnosing HIV infection        represents one part of the solution Less clear is how patients diagnosed with HIV        infection will be monitored given the importance of CD cell counts A decrease in CD         T lymphocytesa critical immune cell infected by HIVis one of the        hallmarks of HIV disease and CD         cell number is a key factor in determining disease progression and        monitoring treatment The methods for determining CD         cell numbers are technically complex expensive and not easily        transportable These factors severely limit the ability to monitor HIV disease in locations        where resources training and mobility are limited        Lymphocytes are characterized by cell surface markers thus CD         lymphocytes express the CD marker on their surface Antibody probes        that specifically recognize this and other cell surface markers such as CD which        distinguishes that lymphocyte population from CD         lymphocytes and CD which is a marker for all T lymphocytes are        used to count and differentiate various cell populations By labeling cells with        fluorescently tagged antibodies that recognize one or more cell surface molecules the        relative and absolute numbers of specific cells can be determined by a technique called        flow cytometry The labeled cells are passed through the flow cytometer where the        fluorescent probes are activated by lasers in a manner that can be read by specific        detectors The CD         cell number is directly correlated with the resultant fluorescent        intensity and other light scatter properties The problem is that flow cytometry requires        costly reagents and substantial technical expertisefactors that limit its use in less        developed areas        Taking advantage of advances in microfluidics digital imaging and cell analysis        William Rodriguez and colleagues now report on a way to count CD         cells in a relatively quick easy and affordable manner Small        volumes of blood an amount that could be obtained by a finger prick as opposed to drawing        blood from a vein are labeled as in flow cytometry but with far less of the expensive        reagents Microfiltration allows the labeled CD         cells to be captured and separated from red blood cells another        simplification relative to flow cytometry Digital images of the labeled cells obtained by        digital fluorescence microscopy are then analyzed by newly developed software that can        distinguish the CD CD and CD labels thus allowing determination of absolute CD         counts CD         percentages and CD         CD         lymphocyte ratios        Rodriguez et al found that this new method was less accurate than flow cytometry for        determining absolute CD         lymphocyte counts above  cellsmm levels that are typically not        relevant for monitoring HIVinfected individuals But the method was as accurate as flow        cytometry at clinically relevant levels of CD cells for HIVinfected adult individuals        Although only a small number of pediatric patients were examined and thus statistical        significance could not be ascertained the method appears to be also effective in        determining CD         lymphocyte percentages in children        The detection system used in the present report is a tabletop instrument that serves as        a prototype for a fully portable handheld model which is now under development After some        modest training such a tool should allow a variety of healthcare workers in remote areas        to accurately analyze the CD         status of HIVinfected patients the basis for treatment decisions        locally In an accompanying Perspective discussing this new tool DOI        journalpmed Zvi Bentwich argues that before it is ready for widespread        use several issues still need to be resolved such as its final cost and its applicability        to pediatric patients Despite these reservations he says the authors of this study        should be commended for addressing an extremely important issue and developing this novel        approach for counting CD in patients with HIV
