                                 Cashing the Chechen Dividend            Sundays parliamentary elections in Russia dominated the worlds editorialpages early this week Although the Communist Party will remain the biggestsingle bloc in the Duma having won  percent of the vote the success ofPrime Minister Vladimir Putins Unity Party which claimed  percent took theink El Pas ofSpain called Putins success the Chechen dividend a sentiment echoedin Britains Daily Telegraph  which said that beyond bellicosity in the Caucasus Mr Putinhas articulated no clear policy The Age of Melbourne headlined its editorial Putin the man who rose without trace and saidPublic attention no longer focuses primarily on the ailing Mr Yeltsinserratic policymaking or even on the widespread corruption ballooning debtand huge disparities of wealth that have arisen during the overrapidprivatisation of the Russian economy Instead the talk is increasingly of aresurgent nationalist Russia pinning its hopes of salvation on a strongleader And it has all happened because Mr Putin launched Russia into a war inChechnya            In aleaderTuesday the FinancialTimes of London said the election results brought both good and badnews The good news is that the new Duma is likely to be younger and somewhatmore sympathetic towards economic liberalism than the last one  The bad newsis that political liberalism has been sacrificed in the process The DailyTelegraph took a similar tack decrying the rise in military influenceand a resumption in the sway of oligarchs such as Boris Berezovsky buttaking heart in the shift of power from conservatives to reformers HongKongs South China MorningPost also attacked the style of the election saying the vote was influenced by an assortment ofelectoral dirty tricks involving money rulebreaking and libelling Kremlinfoes on state television but said that given their limited choices theRussian people were suprisingly selective backing those who may actually dosomething about the sorry state of their nation            Theconservative National Post of Canada asked what the effect of a compatible legislature andexecutive would be and decided that In foreign policy the recentantiWestern tendency is likely to continue but more cautiously and lessexplicitly Thus Mr Primakovs active proIraqi diplomacy in the Middle Eastwill be moderated but Mr Yeltsins pursuit of a Chinese rapprochement tooffset American influence will proceed at a leisurely pace            Acautious note was struck in the St Petersburg Times  which saidthat Putins future looks rosy except as regards concrete policies his mainone so far being the razing of Grozny And the businessmen who have amassedvast fortunes under the Yeltsin regime are able to continue as usual and aredoubtless grinning like Cheshire cats Similarly the Moscow Times said The system of succession that will guarantee the Kremlinsvictory is a very positive development For in circumstances where theauthorities and their opposition are equally corrupt a corrupt regime based onsuccession is preferable to a revolutionary corrupt regime whose ascension tothe throne is accompanied by the hollow grunting of pigs rushing thetroughand who amid the cries of bribetakers to jail make the same pieall over again            Sundays handover of the Portugueseadministered territory of Macau to Chinaafter  years of colonial rule was in marked contrast with the handover ofHong Kong in July  The South China Morning Post described scenes of unconfined joy and delight at thearrival of the

pressure on Taiwan to revert to China is likely to mountconsiderably and the SCMP reported that just before the handover ceremonies ChinesePresident Jiang Zemin announced that China will speed up efforts forreunification with Taiwan in the new year The paper said the strategy willconsist of wooing Taiwanese business groups by offering incentives for jointventures between Taiwanese and mainland firms on one hand and militarypreparation on the other The SCMP quoted Jiang saying Allfarsighted people in the world have seen from the smooth return of Hong Kongand Macau that the one country two systems policy is most appropriate andcorrect and is the best approach to solving the Taiwan question An oped in Canadas National Post by David Lee a Taiwaneseofficial based in Toronto said there would be no more handovers followingMacaus not least because Taiwan is not and never has been a colony            Wednesdays International Herald Tribunedescribed current efforts to remove military
