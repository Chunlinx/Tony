                                  My Way to the eBay            According to the voice onthe radio we should all be worried about compulsive gamblers who spendseveral hours a day playing slot machines I cant figure out what the voicewas thinking Nobody who spends several hours a day playing slot machines canbe called a gambler Gambling is about risk and uncertainty Sit long enough infront of the slots and youll lose your money at an entirely predictable rateThats the very opposite of gambling            Heres what a gamblerdoes He takes a large fraction of what hes got and risks it on a single spinof the wheels You dont see much of that in the casinos Instead you seefolks lugging around buckets filled with quarters parceling those quarters outone at a time Theres a name for that strategy Its called diversificationand its purpose is to eliminate risk The more time these people spend at theslot machines the less theyre gambling            Now Im willing to believe this behavior can becomecompulsive but there are still distinctions worth maintaining These peoplearent addicted to gambling Theyre addicted to sitting in front of slotmachines            Likewise Im notaddicted to shopping Im addicted to eBaythe hottest auction site on theInternet I know this because my bidding strategy which would appear insane toany casual but thoughtful observer makes sense only in the presence of acompulsion to spend as much time as possible monitoring my auctions            Most eBay items are sold in secondbid auctions whichmeans the high bidder gets the item and pays the amount of the secondhighestbid Ive left out a few complications that can be ignored here Ordinarilythere is only one sensible strategy in a secondbid auction Bid the highestamount youd be willing to pay then sit back and wait to see if youvewon            In a standard Englishauction where the high bidder pays his own bid bidders usually try tolowballthat is to bid less than theyre willing to pay in the hope ofwalking away with a bargain But theres no reason to lowball in a secondbidauction because the amount you pay is independent of the amount you bid Ifthe antique royal blue water pitcher is worth  to me I should bid not  If youre not convinced click for a detailed explanation            Moreover the same reasoning says that it makes not a shredof difference whether I bid early or late So why do I repeatedly find myselfbidding furiously in the last five minutes of an auction and submitting threedifferent bids in succession when one should suffice Either Im behavingirrationally or my analysis of bidding strategy contains an invalid assumptionFor that there are several candidates            First I assumed that Istart off knowing what Im willing to pay for the water pitcher But maybethats wrong Maybe I learn what Im willing to pay by observing theprogress of the auction eBay lets me observe the number of bidders theidentity of the highest bidder so far and the amount of the secondhighestbid so far When  new bidders jump in or when a bidder I respect moves outin front of the pack I might revise my valuation and submit a new bid            Of course that explanation works only if I care about theother bidders opinionssay because I think they know more than I do orbecause Im trying to predict what kind of resale market I might face somedayFor me though the resale market is irrelevant I never resell anythingthanks to the same obsessive traits that keep me on eBay in the first placeOn the other hand maybe I do care about resale prices because I like knowingthat my possessions inspire envy            If I can learn from other bidders then they canlearn from mewhich is the second reason I might want to deviate from asimplistic bid and wait strategy I bid low at first to convince mycompetitors that the item isnt worth much Then I jump in with a higher bid atthe end hoping that at least some of those competitors are away from theircomputers and unable to respond            So bidding should beleisurely when bidders have little to learn from each other say when theyrebidding on a new computer thats been widely reviewed and intense when somebidders are far more expert than others say when theyre bidding on a heartdefibrillator for home use Thats a nice testable hypothesis Unfortunatelyit seems to have failed its first test When one of my colleagues used eBay tosell an outrageously expensive ie over  bottle of Bordeaux winethree bidders submitted eight different bids in the first three days Now ifsomebody is willing to pay  for a bottle of wine Im inclined to guessthat hes well informed about its quality So why are these people revisingtheir bids            Maybe theyre just addicted to bidding Maybe I am tooLast week eBay listed a collectible knife with which I am entirely familiar Ibid  which exhausted my willingness to pay But in the final five minutesI raised my bid to  then  then  and finally won the auctionexhilarated by my victory            Maybe eBay just makes me giddy As a free marketaficionado I am intoxicated by the prospect of onestop shopping for housescars Beanie Babies and underwear all at prices that adjust instantly to thedemands of consumers around the globe Or maybe the behavior of eBayers can beexplained only by subtler and more carefully tested theories that have not yetbeen devised Given the mountain of data being generated by eBay I suspectthose theories will be the stuff of doctoral theses for a long time tocome
