Where to GoTo the surprise of many firsttime visitors Cuba is no speck in the Caribbean Nicols Guilln the nations finest poet described the island as a long green alligator Long it certainly is at  km  miles from snout to tail Nearly the size of England Cuba is divided into  provinces and incorporates some  offshore islands known as cayos cays or keysGiven its size you would need at least a month to explore Cuba fully Most people begin their journeys in the capital Havana before heading to the prized tobacco lands farther west and doubling back across the plains of sugar cane and some of the countrys finest colonial towns in central Cuba The eastern region known as Oriente has soaring mountains and Cubas second and most musical city Santiago de CubaResort hotels hug quintessential Caribbean beaches around the whole island and though many package tourists still stick close to the coasts every region has charming engaging towns Sand and sun Cuba certainly has but most visitors who dare to step away from the beach will find it simply too beguiling to spend a whole holiday lying idly in front of their hotelsHavana La HabanaThe islands capital with almost  million inhabitants is one of the most intoxicating cities in the world Ever since its early maritime days and through the swhen gangsters who ran prostitution and gambling rackets made Havana synonymous with decadenceit has always held a slightly seedy languorous allure That nostalgic appeal is still evidentToday Havana is a oneofakind fascinating study in decay Unrestrained ocean waves and salty sea spray have wrecked huge chunks of the Malecn the sumptuous promenade and roadway that traces the edge of the sea Throughout the city crumbling houses three and four stories tall somehow still standing line backstreets where children play stickball and their parents and grandparents hover around doorstoops In Old Havana magnificently restored colonial palaces and stately baroque churches and convents crowd pulsating squares Once the finest colonial city in the Americas Havanas grandeur has not been destroyed even by decades of crisis and neglect No less defiant than Castro himself beneath the rubble this city is a living breathing vital and sensual creatureHavana sprawls over more than  square km  square miles and is divided into five districts Those of greatest interest are Habana Vieja Old Havana Centro Habana Central Havana Vedado andto a lesser extentMiramar The latter two districts are newer residential and shopping barrios that extend west and south of the old city While most areas within a neighborhood can be covered comfortably on foot passing from one to the other usually requires a taxi or bicitaxi the latter is Cubas bicycle taxi a type of pedicabOld Havana La Habana ViejaThe oldest section of Havana is the citys most spectacular even if restoration work and gleaming coats of pastel colonial colors plus a stern police presence on every corner are leaving parts of it with a slightly more sanitized feel than the weathered working class neighborhoods that extend along the water and inland As the location of the citys greatest historical sites Old Havana is where youll want to spend most of your time if it is limitedHavana was founded along a vast natural harbor in  During the th century a fleet of galleons laden with treasures used the port as a pit stop on the way back to Spain from the New World By the th century pirate attacks prompted the building of extensive city defensescolossal forts a chain across the harbor mouth and prominent city wallsmaking Havana the Bulwark of the West IndiesThe wealthiest residents lived with their slaves in grand mansions constructed in mudjar style a ChristianMuslim architectural tradition dating from medieval Spain Hidden courtyards bathed in penumbral light lurked behind massive doors slatted blinds carved iron window bars rejas and halfmoon stainedglass windows mediopuntosThe presence of such architectural wonders no matter how dilapidated led UNESCO to declare Old Havana a World Heritage Site in  In the central tourist quarter an expanding number of buildings are being spruced up with the assistance of UNESCO and foreign foundations but many others are propped up by wooden columns leantos that appear to be merely forestalling the inevitable Their arcades fluted pillars and mosaic tiles are teetering on last legs praying for restoration miracles At night the deep darkness of the streets is punctuated only by the neon glow of TV sets from tiny front rooms and the occasional headlights of a small colony of gasguzzling vintage Chevrolets and PlymouthsHavanas distant era lives on Legendary places plucked from the pages of popular novels and the lives of fiction writers need little input from visitors to evoke their storied past Graham Greenes Hotel Sevilla where Our Man in Havana went to meet his secret service contact and Hemingways favorite watering holes El Floridita and La Bodeguita del Medio and the Hotel Ambos Mundos where he penned much of For Whom the Bell TollsOld Havana is best experienced on foot although you can also pick up a bicitaxi pedicab to get to the Malecn or the museums at the districts edgePlaza de la CatedralHavanas delicious Cathedral Square the focus of Habana Vieja life could be a stage set Most days a colorful crafts market spreads across the cobbled square and tourists linger at El Patios outdoor caf sipping mojitos and tapping their toes to a sampling of Cuban son The allhours hubbub here is infectious The glorious baroque faade and asymmetrical belltowers of the late thcentury cathedral are only marginally the squares top attraction Yet the church begun by Jesuits in  is a thing of beauty one half expects its bells to erupt in triumphant song Its clean interior is surprisingly plain but it once held the remains of Christopher Columbus Just south of the cathedral are superb colonial mansions with bright shutters and mediopuntos and an attractive little culdesac Callejn de Chorro with a graphic arts workshopOf particular interest in the Cathedral Square is the Museo de Arte Colonial housed in a handsome palace dating to  Its yellow courtyard and littlealtered architectural features are complemented by a large collection of th and thcentury furnitureJust round the corner on Calle Empedrado at no  youll find the atmospheric barrestaurant La Bodeguita del Medio see page  which according to Hemingway served Havanas finest mojito management apparently believes the notoriety is worth an extra two dollars per drink Like pilgrims to Ernests drinking shrine all tourists seem required to pay their respects here Art exhibitions are held down the street at the Centro Cultural Wilfredo Lam at the corner of San Ignacio named for Cubas top modern artist Books manuscripts and photographs of the countrys bestknown novelist are housed inside the Centro de Promocin Cultural Alejo Carpentier Empedrado Plaza de ArmasPlaza de Armas which surrounds a statue of the patriot Cspedes and is ringed by shaded marble benches and secondhand booksellers is Havanas oldest square It dates to the citys founding in On the squares eastern side a small neoclassical temple El Templete marks the spot where the first Catholic mass was celebrated in  Next door is one of the citys most luxurious hotels Hotel Santa Isabel The squat but angular and moated Castillo de la Real Fuerza Fort of the Royal Forces to the north is one of the oldest forts in the Americas begun in  The battlements afford good views over the harbor and there are craft shops upstairs The bronze La Giraldilla weather vane on one of the forts towersdepicting a woman scanning the seas for her lost husband an early Cuban governorhas been adopted as the symbol of the city and of Havana Club rumIn  the seat of government and the governors or captain generals residence were transferred from the fort to the newly built baroque Palacio de los Capitanes Generales Palace of the Captain Generals on the squares western flank A magnificent structure that was the presidential palace and then the municipal palace until Castro seized power it now houses the Museo de la Ciudad de la Habana the Museum of the City of Havana Beyond the serene courtyard and its statue of Columbus lie a succession of splendid marbled and chandeliered rooms some housing old cannonballs and coaches others decked out in gilded furnishings The most hallowed room commemorates Cubas thcentury independence wars with the very first Cuban flag and venerated personal objects from generals of the dayCalle ObispoRunning all the way from Plaza de Armas to Parque Central the pedestrianonly Calle Obispo is Old Havanas most important thoroughfare Here you can peer into apothecaries unchanged since the th century as well as some of Havanas oldest homes Equally fascinating are the two parallel partly residential streetsOReilly and Obrapawhere grand neoclassical and colonial buildings intermingle with decrepit tenementsMuch of restored Old Havana is concentrated in only a few blocks at the eastern end of these streets On the corner of Mercaderes and Obispo is the recently renovated sera Hotel Ambos Mundos Hemingway lived on and off in room  for a couple of years during the s The room contains original artifacts from Hemingways many years in Cuba including the typewriter he used to write most of For Whom the Bell Tolls those not staying in the hotel can visit the room for USNearby are several museums worth visiting as much for the glorious colonial mansions that house them as for their contents On Calle Obrapa between Mercaderes and San Ignacio is the striking lemonyellow Casa de la Obra Pa This thcentury architectural wonder features baroque additions around a flowerdrenched courtyard and a full set of beautifully furnished domestic rooms The owner a member of one of Cubas most important families rescued orphan girls and took them into his homehis obra pa work of piety that lends its name to both the house and its street The massive mansion opposite nearly as impressive houses the Casa de frica with pelts drums costumes carved figures and furniture from some  African countries as well as a tantalizing collection of objects related to santera the syncretic AfroCuban religion see page  Casa de frica will likely be closed for renovations until the end of The Museo Numismtico Calle Oficios  has a comprehensive set of Cuban coins and banknotes A little farther on lies the Casa de los rabes Calle Oficios  a Moorishstyle thcentury building that now comprises a bazaar piled high with carpets robes and pottery Havanas only place of worship for Muslims and a lovely restaurant tucked away in the courtyardThe streets of Havana are a living museum of chromefinned wondercars imported during Detroits heyday but several that once belonged to pivotal Cuban figuresamong them a  Ford truck used by Fidels father and Ches  Chevrolet Bel Airare lined up in the Museo de Autos Antiguos Calle Oficios Continuing west along Calle Oficios youll come to a splendidly restored square Plaza de San Francisco with upscale shops restaurants and the imposing thcentury Iglesia y Convento de San Francisco de Ass The convent contains a museum with Spanish treasures and you can climb the belltower for spectacular views of Old Havana Concerts are frequently held here Nearby youll find several impeccable colonialera houses with brilliantly colored faadesPlaza ViejaFollow charming Calle Mercaderes to the fascinating and aptly named Plaza Vieja Old Square which began life in  housing wealthy merchants It is slowly receiving a massive facelift with assistance from UNESCO but most of its mansions remain in terrible disrepair Laundry adorns disintegrating balconies while in the center of the plaza an incongruous neoclassical gleaming marble fountain has been installed its an unmitigated disaster in this atmospheric corner of Old Havana On the southwest corner of the square a fine thcentury palace has been converted into an arts center Just east is the Art Nouveaustyle fabulously decayed Hotel Palacio Vienna a ghost building if ever there was oneThe old backstreets here are full of character but seldom visited by tourists Down Calle Cuba between Sol and Luz stands the th century Convento de Santa Clara an expansive complex that takes up several blocks Inside is a tranquil courtyard garden full of exotic trees A convent until  it is now an architectural conservation center It is also a hostel Residencia Acadmica Santa Clara which provides peaceful simple rooms see page  a lot of visitors have longterm stays on their mindsBy the train station between Calles Picota and Egido is the modest Casa Natal de Jos Mart at Calle Leonor Prez  the birthplace of poet and statesman Jos Mart The numerous personal effects on display leave no doubt about Marts importance in the pantheon of Cuban heroes he is Cubas founding father The train station itself is fascinating with hundreds of people waiting in line and a parking lot full of bicycledriven pedicabs and vintage taxisThe PradoWest of the oldest sections and intimate streets of Old Havana is an area of wide boulevards and grand palaces The loveliest avenue the Prado formally known as Paseo de Mart runs from Parque Central to the sea Grand but rundown buildings with fading flamingopink and limegreen faades and ornate columns flank a raised promenade of laurels gas lamps and marble benches In the th century this was the citys most fashionable strolling ground Now it serves as a minipark for habaneros as Havanas citizens are called from coupling lovers and children playing on homemade skateboards to parading prostitutesThe streets Brasil and Obrapa lead directly west to the monumental Capitolio a replica of the American capitol in Washington DC Completed in  it reflects the period when Cuba was in the thrall of the United States Its vast bronze doors pictorially chart the islands history and the immense main gallery inside has a diamond in the floor beneath the dome symbolizing that nowdistant era when Cuba was richDirectly behind the Capitolio is the large Partags Tobacco Factory the biggest export factory in the countrywith more than  rollers churning out  million cigars a yearand one of Havanas top tourist draws This factory which has been rolling out puros since the midth century is the best and with an admission fee of US the most expensive to visit on the island it also has an excellent tobacco shop and smoking lounge for aficionados and wannabes There are two tours daily see page  If the cigars inside strike you as too expensive youll have plenty of opportunity to purchase fake or stolen stogies outside the factory as every third person whispers You want cigar as you passJust east of the Capitolio on Parque Central near the classic Hotel Inglaterra stands the magnificent Gran Teatro built in  The home of the Cuban National Ballet and Opera drips with ornate balustrades shutters and sculpted columns The cavernous interior is hardly less awesome but can only be visited during performancesThose with the Hemingway bug shouldnt miss a visit to El Floridita see page  at the intersection of Calles Obispo and Montserrate one block east of Parque Central The writer immortalized the swanky bar in Islands in the Stream Hemingway photos adorn the walls his seat is on the extreme left of the elegant mahogany bar and his favorite daiquiri is now referred to as the Papa Hemingway with double rum and no sugar everyone knows he was an alcoholic the barmen claim he was also diabetic If you dont mind sipping a  daiquiri the monthly wage of the doorman the place is eminently capable of evoking the kind of hedonistic refuge expat writers adoreHoused in the grand presidential palace used by presidents and dictators between  and  the fascinating and didactic Museo de la Revolucin is the countrys largest and most interesting museum Youll find an exhaustive exhibit of the trajectory of the  Cuban Revolution so allow a couple of hours to view it The most absorbing sections chart the struggle to power with a variety of illustrations countless maps evocative photos of both torture victims and triumphal scenes and assorted personal memorabilia from passports to bloodstained clothes In the square outside is the ordinarylooking Granma the boat that carried Castros  rebels to shore in  it is now enclosed in glass and guarded by military policeOn the seafront at Crcel  the Museo Nacional de la Msica National Music Museum is of interest mainly for its extensive informative collection of African drums and the many stringed instruments used in Cuban traditional musicHavanas FortsCubas most impressive forts sit brooding over the capitals commercial harbor Take a taxi through the road tunnel underneath the water to reach them The older one constructed at the end of the th century is the Castillo de los Tres Santos Reyes Magos del Morro better known as El Morro From its position at the harbor mouth the views of Havana over the defiant cannons are magicalThe vast Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabaa known as La Cabaa running beside the harbor was constructed after the English capture of Havana in  The largest fort ever built in the Americas it is impressively well preserved and the gardens and ramparts are romantically lit in the evening A ceremony at pm reenacts the firing of a cannon that marked the closing of the city gatesNew HavanaThe walls surrounding Old Havana were razed during the th century to allow the city to expand westward The long curvaceous and crumbling Malecn breakwater a sixlane highway alongside the citys north shore links the districts of Central Havana and Vedado The victim of harmful salt spray the seafront drive is now more a seafront dive At its eastern end primarycolored buildingsa showcase of tragic splendorseem to fall apart before your eyes Havanas youth congregate along the Malecn on fine evenings flying kites necking swimming off the rocks and setting out to sea in giant inner tubes to fishAlthough most visitors will want to concentrate on historic and museumlike Old Havana the newer districts provide a fascinating view of the areas where most people live and work The most interesting districts of New Havana are Central Havana and Vedado The former is a congested lowermiddleclass barrio with few attractions for visitors although a walk along its dusty streets and crumbling faades can be an eyeopening experience Vedado is the citys principal commercial and residential zonethe epicenter of middleclass Havanawith parks monuments hotels restaurants theaters and the University of Havana Once the stomping grounds of the elite in the s the suburb of Miramar today is home to the offices of rich foreign companies investing in Cuba and the diplomatic missions of foreign governmentsCentral Havana Centro HabanaCentral Havana is a ramshackle residential and commercial area The citys main shopping street Calle San Rafael traverses it from the Parque Central westward This might be Havana at its least guarded While having a fascinating stroll here you can stop to have your nails painted or get a shave and a haircut all right on the pavement One of the countrys new private markets has overrun Havanas small Chinatown at Calles Zanja and Rayo Amazingly even downtrodden Central Havana is being transformed by the presence of glittering dollar storesThe neighborhood known as Cayo Hueso just behind the Malecn is a roughandtumble barrio once populated by cigarfactory workers Today the main reason to visit is to check out Calle Hamel where the artist Salvador Gonzlez has dedicated himself to preserving the areas AfroCuban culture The small alleyway the scene of a good many photo shoots is entirely done over in street art and graffiti Gonzlez has his studio here and on Sundays at around pm there are performances of AfroCuban ritual and rumbaVedadoVedado had its heyday in the s and s when such gangsters as Meyer Lansky held sway in the Nacional Riviera and Capri hotels Such stars as Frank Sinatra and Ginger Rogers performed and American tourists emptied their wallets in glittering casinos The revolution put the lid on the nightlife by banning gambling and deporting the MafiosiSave for the stately elegant Hotel Nacional see page  overlooking the Malecn the hotels here have now seen better days Vedado is Havanas most respectable business district as well as a leafy residential area spacious and orderly in comparison with Old and Central HavanaBusiness is centered on La Rampa the name for Calle  from Calle L to the sea Opposite the towerblock Hotel Habana Librethe Havana Hilton in prerevolutionary daysis the Coppelia ice cream park At this institution locals queue for hours for the prized ice cream eating several scoops in one sitting or ladling them into saucepans to take home Hardhearted foreigners paying in dollars down their scoops in a cordonedoff area Coppelia was instrumental in the awardwinning Cuban film Fresa y Chocolate Strawberry and Chocolate a daring film about freedoms and revolutionary fervor in contemporary Havana its title is a wry reference to the lack of choices of ice cream flavorsindeed of all thingsin CubaA short walk up the hill brings you to the University of Havana founded in the early th century a quiet attractive campus of neoclassical buildings Englishspeaking students eager to meet foreigners are numerous here Directly east on Calle San Miguel between Calles Ronda and Mazn is the fine and surprising Museo Napolenico The mansion boasts not only Empire furniture but also a remarkable collection of Napoleonic memorabilia busts portraits and even his pistol hat and death mask from St Helena The house and contents were acquired by the state from a rich owner in In the same year the government acquired the Museo de Artes Decorativas at Calle  between Calles D and E Each room in this grand thcentury villa is furnished in a particular style English Chippendale Chinese baroque or Art Deco in the fabulous bathroomVedados top sight though is the Cementerio de Cristbal Coln Columbus Cemetery Massive marble mausoleums line the principal avenues of the cemetery a vast city of the dead established in the late s Cubans come to pray and place flowers at the tomb of La Milagrosa The Miracle Worker who helps people in need It is said that she was buried with her infant at her feet but when their bodies were exhumed the child was found cradled in her armsPlaza de la RevolucinThe barren district known as Plaza de la Revolucin is worth visiting only for a brief glimpse of the square of the same name a vast concourse where political rallies are held Hideous highrise ministry buildings erected in the s by Batista and a giant tapering concrete obelisklooking like a rocket launch pad with a pensive Jos Mart at its footprovide the scenery The Ministry of the Interior building adorned by a giant iron sculpturemural of Che is where Fidel Castro supposedly punches the clockMiramarMore attractive is the exclusive suburb of Miramar to the west The villas of the prerevolutionary rich expropriated by the state have now been divided into apartments or turned into offices But embassies along Avenida  still imbue the area with a leisurely privileged feelAt the corner of Calle  the Museo del Ministerio del Interior has some intriguing exhibits relating to CIA espionage including code boxes concealed in briefcases decoding equipment and a transmitter hidden in a fake rock Dont miss the towering Russian Embassy between Calles  and  looking for all the world like a giant concrete robotGrowing as an attractionliterallyis the Maqueta de Habana Calle   eAvenida  y  a scale model of the entire city in astounding  detail Havana is so expansive that a visit to the Maqueta can help organize the citys neighborhoods in your mindHavanas OutskirtsHavanas suburbs are sprawling and grimy but they contain a couple of places associated with Ernest Hemingway that are magnets for those seeking to trace the Nobel Prize winners life in Cuba From  to  he lived on and off in the Finca Viga now the Casa Museo de Ernest Hemingway The sight is  km  miles southeast of Havana in San Francisco de Paula so you will have to take a taxi Visitors may not enter the graceful bungalow villa but by peering through windows and doors you can see all the rooms furnished as the writer had them covered in bullfighting posters and filled with more than  books including such titles as The Guide to Hunting and Fishing in Cuba You can roam the lush gardens searching out his motorboat the PilarHemingway kept the Pilar  km  miles to the east of Havana at Cojmar the probable model for the settlement in The Old Man and the Sea Next to a diminutive fort in the little towns old corner is a Hemingway bust looking out over the bay The writer frequented La Terraza restaurant nearby see page  worth visiting for its many photographs of Hemingway in action Still kicking after all these years is yearold Gregorio Fuentes Hemingways fishing companion and the inspiration for Santiagothe Old Man Hes likely to be hanging out at La Terraza and for a few bucks or a few drinks will tell tales of his times with PapaFarther east approximately  km  miles from Havana the Playas del Este Eastern Beaches are less charming but a big draw for Cubans unable to afford much in the way of beach vacations These beaches are acceptable for a short break from city life but you are unlikely to want to spend your holiday here The long sandy beaches are excellent but often buffeted by windsPinar del Ro ProvinceDue west of Havana is Pinar del Ro province Cubas westernmost regiona finger of land with the Gulf of Mexico to the north and the Caribbean to the south It contains some of Cubas most beautiful countryside among the lush Guaniguanico mountains and surrounding patchwork of lushly verdant fields vegas where the worlds finest tobacco is cultivated In the beautiful Viales valley tobacco fields and ancient limestone formations produce spectacular scenery more reminiscent of Southeast Asia than the Caribbean In this resolutely agricultural region oxen tilling redearth fields and cowboy peasants guajiros on horseback are much more common than cars Residents of Havana might think of it as a poor backwater but the easy almost somnolent pace breathtaking countryside and welcoming residents of Pinar del Ro make it one of Cubas certain highlightsThere are beaches and excellent diving farther west near Playa Mara la Gorda but for most visitors the star attractions are the irresistible town of Viales and its beautiful valley Many visitors take organized daytrips of the region from Havana hotels but an overnight stay in Vialesoverlooking the valleyis highly recommendedStart your explorations by driving west on the autopista highway linking Havana with the provinces capital city of Pinar del Ro About  km  miles along the highway a turnoff leaves the level palmdotted plains for Soroa where a richly endowed botanical garden nestles in the mountain foothills near a tired little tourist complex A guided tour reveals an orchid garden lychee and mango trees coffee plants and splendid specimens of jagey and ceiba trees A restaurant in the villa of Castillo de las Nubes on a nearby mountain has stunning viewsAt the end of the highway  km  miles west of Havana the small city of Pinar del Ro is a bustling commercial center Along the main street Calle Jos Mart lowrise neoclassical buildings in blues yellows greens and orange have a stately but dilapidated quality In backstreet houses men make homemade cigars youll find a small interesting tobacco factory Francisco Donatien Fbrica de Tobacos housed in an old jail below the Plaza de la Independencia Visitors are welcome here and at the less picturesque Casa Garay Rum Factory on Avenida Isabel Rubio where they make a local rum liqueur called guayabita del PinarThe road southwest from the city to San Juan y Martnez leads deep into tobaccos heartlandthe Vuelta Abajowhere the worlds greatest tobacco is grown Amid fields of big green leaves ripening in the sun and plantations covered in canvas sheets stand wooden tobacco barns Here leaves are hung on poles with a needle and thread and then dried turning from green to brownSome  km  miles to the north of Pinar del Ro lies the most picturesque corner of Cuba The deeply green Viales valley is spattered with mogotes sheersided limestone masses covered in thick vegetation Remnants of an underwater plateau that collapsed in the Jurassic period they are part of a geological formation at least  million years old Tobacco of slightly lesser quality than in the Vuelta Abajo grows here in a patchwork of fields and dries in bohos constructed with shaggy thatch Cigarchomping guajiros in enormous straw hats urge on their oxen while vultures swoop overhead At any time of day you can wander into the fields and meet the modest farmers who might smother you with hospitality cigars coffee and so forth and pose for photosAt Casa del Veguero Carretera a Viales km  youll find the grizzled farmer El Nio whom the government has unofficially appointed the face of tobaccoCubas Marlboro man Next to his farm on the road into Viales is a stateowned tobacco and souvenir shop The best valley views can be had from either of its lovely and economical hotels Los Jazmines and La Ermita The sight at dusk is especially alluringThe town of Viales is surprisingly spruce with a fetching arcaded main street and lovely rustic scenes down the back lanes Next to the paladar a restaurant in a private home and across from the Cupet gas station is a delightful botanical garden overseen by two elderly women whose father began planting the hundreds of species of plantsNearby a couple of local tourist sights on all the package excursions have curiosity value but little else One limestone mogote just west of town was painted by workmen dangling on ropes in the s with a Mural de la Prehistoria Mural of Prehistorycommissioned by Castro himselfthat is  meters  feet high and  meters  feet long The garish painting an exercise in bad judgment and sloppy execution depicts evolution from an ammonite to a dinosaur to advanced and presumably socialist Homo sapiens Just to the north of town the extensive Cueva del Indio Indian Cave was used as a hideout by Indians after the conquest A tour through the cave includes a brief ride on an underground river in a boat which wouldbe emigrants once stole for an unsuccessful escape attempt to Florida Both mural and cave have decent tourist restaurants About  km  miles north of Viales the Cueva del Viales is a curious bar and disco carved out of a cave amazingly its open  hoursCayo Largo and the Isle of YouthThe two main islands in the Archipilago de los Canarreos south of western Cuba could not be more different Cayo Largo is a tourist enclave where visitors are never more than a few yards from sugarwhite sands Yet its an antiseptic place devoid of any Cubans except those who work there By contrast the Isle of Youth sees virtually no tourists except those at the rather isolated Hotel El Colony on the small islands southwestern tip who come exclusively for the superb diving at a nearby beachCayo Largo an island  km  miles long and the most easterly of the Archipilago de los Canarreos might be your Caribbean paradiseif all youre looking for is a dazzling white beach and clear blue seas Other than the miles of beaches theres not much else of consequence here except mangrove scrub and half a dozen comfortable hotels with a full program of entertainment and watersports Turtles nest in the sand at one end of the island At the other you can go sailing diving or deepsea fishing or take a boat trip to Playa Sirena an incomparable strip of sand a minute boat ride away where lobster lunches are available Cayo Largo with its captive tourist audience is considerably more expensive than the mainlandSome package tourists spend the whole of their holiday on Cayo Largo Those with low boredom thresholds might consider coming for only a daytrip or for overnight trips on halfhour flights from Havana and VaraderoThe Isla de la Juventud Isle of Youth is Cubas largest offshore island some  km  miles in diameter but not its prettiest It is said to have been the location for Robert Louis Stevensons Treasure Island pirates once buried their booty here The island received its jaunty name in the s when as many as  foreign students mainly from politically sympathetic African countries studied here in no fewer than  schoolsThe island fails to live up to its colorful past The number of foreign students has dropped to fewer than  and derelict boarding schools dot the monotonous countryside However there are plenty of virgin beaches to be discovered and in a slightly dingy cave at Punta del Este you can examine enigmatic symbols painted centuries ago by Siboney IndiansFor more accessible entertainment Nueva Gerona the islands little capital is moderately attractive with striped awnings along its smart pillared main street Just east of town the Presidio Modelo Model Prison is fascinating The dictator Machado built this copy of an American penitentiary in  Castro and  of his rebels were sent here after the storming of the Moncada Barracks their ward and the cell in which Castro was kept in solitary confinement have been reconstructedMatanzas ProvinceThe province east of Havanalargely flat sugarcane countrywas in the th century Cubas most important caneproducing region For todays visitors however the focus is on the bigtime beach resort of Varadero Cubas biggest draw with opportunities for side trips to atmospheric timewarped towns and to the swamplands of the south coastVaraderoVaradero has enthusiastic proponents and equally passionate detractors among its visitors A long peninsula with many dozens of hotels and restaurants bars fastfood cafs and grocery shops and more of each on the way Varadero doesnt feel much like Cuba at all The easyspending gringos here stick out like a sore thumb in this land of hardship and their isolation increases year after year Varadero is a package destination and plenty of visitors fly into it and never leave If you want to see and learn what makes Cuba a fascinating place though youll need to escape for at least a couple of daytrips In towns around Cuba youll meet tourists wholike jailbird escapeesrejoice at having gotten out of VaraderoStill there are plenty of delighted folks for whom this is heaven a km mile long virtually uninterrupted whitesand beach with shallow clean waters that are described immodestly by the authorities as the most beautiful in the world Varadero isnt a recent development by a government desperate for hard currency though officials are determined to see it become a faceless cash cow not unlike Cancn It was in the s that Varadero first attracted millionaires who built palatial holiday villas Tourism proper began after World War II with the construction of casinos and such establishments as the Hotel InternacionalEven the beach Varaderos best feature can be problematic Northern winds kick up with considerable frequency and lifeguards put out the red flags to warn of the dangerous undertow There is often a strong smell from the oil pumps on the resorts outskirts Prostitution and hassling are constant and blatant and other pests namely mosquitoes are a real annoyance Moreover the resort is spread out over  km  miles with no real center so you need transport to get aroundOn the other hand Varadero has many very comfortable hotels most of them the results of international joint ventures open bars and an excellent range of watersports And unlike other parts of Cuba topless sunbathing is allowed here If you tire of the beach there are organized excursions to every conceivable point of interest on the islandincluding Havana an hour and a half awayVaradero occupies a long thin insular spit of sand with water on both sides and a bridge to the mainland Between Calles  and  theres something of a local community of Cubans with ancient Cadillacs parked outside rickety wooden bungalows The liveliest area is around Calles  to  with a shopping mall a host of restaurants and bars and the Retiro Josone a pretty park set around a palmfringed boating lakeSpreading several miles farther east are the newest hotel complexes and also the restaurant Las Amricas an opulent beachside mansion completed by the French millionaire Irene Du Pont in Matanzas and CrdenasThough just spitting distance away these quintessentially Cuban towns are a world apart from Varadero Their poorly stocked shops dusty backstreets and primitive transport provide Varaderos package tourists with a convenient insight into everyday Cuban life before theyre whisked back to their hotelsMatanzas  km  miles west of Varadero is busy and grimy Lying alongside a deep bay it came into its own during the th century as the countrys sugar capital On the leafy main square Parque Libertad the Museo Farmacutico is a wonderfully preserved chemists shop founded in  On a street running east toward the bay the Catedral de San Carlos is notable for its many murals some restored some badly in need of attentionA little farther to the east impressive buildings on Plaza de la Viga include the Palacio de Junco which houses a secondrate provincial museum and the Teatro Sauto Constructed in  the lovely theater has tiers of wroughtiron boxes and a mural ceiling there are performances most weekendsLas Cuevas de Bellamar a short distance to the south are Cubas oldest tourist site The caves were discovered by chance in  by a Chinese slave Tours in English take you down into a vast chamber for views of the many stalactites and stalagmitesFortunes have changedand not for the betterfor the town of Crdenas  km  miles east of Varadero Once the islands most important port for sugar exportation its now a ramshackle place with long shopping lines and dozens of horses and carts streaming up and down its main street With its statue of Columbus the main square is elegant and the Museo Oscar Mara de Rojas at Avenida  and Calle  houses a quirky varied collection of items from slaves manacles to a thcentury funeral coach and two fleas all dressed up to danceZapata PeninsulaThe Zapata Peninsula is the largest wetlands area in the Caribbean flat as a pancake and covered in mangrove swamps and grassland plains Its protected wildlife includes crocodiles manatees and numerous species of birds Frankly though you are unlikely to see any interesting wildlife unless you take a guided birdwatching trip from Playa Larga You can see penned reptiles at the crocodile farm at La Boca a popular tourist site where you can pose with a baby croc and taste crocodile steakA more appealing prospect is picturesque Guam a halfhour boat ride from La Boca along an artificial channel and then across the vast Laguna del Tesoro Treasure Lake Legend has it that the Indians dumped their jewels into the water rather than surrender them to Spanish conquistadores Guam is a group of tiny islands connected by wooden bridges A few visitors stay in the thatched cabaas see page  but most just come to wander along the boardwalk greet the ducks and egrets and have a mealThe peninsula is best known however for its bloody role in clandestine political warfare South of La Boca you soon come to Playa Girnsite of the  USled Bay of Pigs invasion see page  At irregular intervals along the often crabinfested road are concrete memorials to those who died during the invasion There are two simple isolated bungalow hotel complexes on the bay one at quiet Playa Larga the other at Playa Girn where the already scruffy beach is further spoiled by a concrete breakwater One major attraction however is the excellent Museo Playa Girn which serves as an emotional memorial to the threeday Bay of Pigs debacleCentral CubaTourists usually eager to get to one end of the country or the other usually whiz through central Cuba The only tourist beacons are on or near the coasts in the south around Cienfuegoss bay and at Trinidad a gorgeous colonial gem and in the north at the small resorts of Cayo Coco and Guillermo and Playa Santa Luca Elsewhere those who pause to explore can feel like goldfish in a bowlforeigners are still a novelty hereCentral Cuba comprises five provinces from west to east these are Cienfuegos Villa Clara Sancti Spiritus Ciego de Avila and Camagey Each focuses on a provincial city of the same or similar name typically of some interest yet not likely to detain you for longer than a day The west has the best scenery found in the lush Sierra del Escambray mountains To the east of Sancti Spiritus towns are plunked down on unremittingly flat plains Here sugar cane as high as three men grows in abundance trucks trundle around with monster bundles of the stuff and chimneys of sugarcane factories poke skyward like cathedral towers In Camagey the cattleranch province rusty watermills punctuate the skyline and vaqueros cowboys slouch on horses with machetes and lassos at the readyCienfuegosThe best feature of the port city of Cienfuegos  km miles southeast of Havana is its position set at the back of a large bay Despite the industry on its periphery the center is quite attractive with pastelcolored neoclassical buildings Many travelers now stop off here on their way to TrinidadThe focal point in town is Parque Jos Mart one of the grandest squares in the country Here you will find the monumental reddomed government offices an early thcentury cathedral with a startling goldpainted interior and a music hall casa de la trova see page  with whimsical flourishes Take a guided tour of the towns finest colonial building the Teatro Toms Terry on the north side of the square Built in  it was named after a rich sugar plantation owner from Venezuela The interior largely original has a lovely frescoed ceiling and a semicircle of tiered boxes and wooden seats Enrico Caruso and Sara Bernhardt once performed here and on weekends you may be able to catch a performance by one of Cubas top ballet companies The Catedral de la Pursima Concepcin built in  is on the east side of the square It has an attractive interior with French stainedglass windows depicting the twelve apostlesThe Prado is the towns principal thoroughfare a palmlined boulevard that takes you down to the spit of land protruding into the bay past smart waterside villas At the edge of Punta Gorda near the end of the Malecn Calle  is the Palacio del Valle This ornate palace now a restaurant was finished in  its ceilings and walls are covered in patterned stoneworkAt the mouth of the bay on the western side the Castillo de Jagua was constructed by the Spanish in  long before the citys founding in  to ward off pirates You reach the castle on a tiny ferry from the Hotel Pasacaballo on the eastern side of the bay Close to the hotel is the best beach in the area Playa Rancho LunaThe Jardn Botnico Soledad  km  miles outside Cienfuegos on the road to Trinidad is the oldest botanical garden in Cuba it dates to  and one of the finest tropical gardens in the world Ask at the tourist office in Cienfuegos about guided tours of the gardensTrinidadThe scenic undulating km mile road east from Cienfuegos to Trinidad skirts the foothills of the Sierra del Escambray Cubas secondhighest mountain range The beguiling town of Trinidad the third of Diego Velzquezs original seven settlements subsequently became rich through the smuggling slave and sugar trades Its sizable old town is endowed with marvelous Spanish colonial architecture and has been named by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site Cuba could package it as a time capsule it is the islands prettiest town and one of the finest preserved colonial cities in all the AmericasWithin easy striking distance of Trinidad are enough attractions to make a longer stay especially rewarding including the fine beach of Playa Ancn the lush Valley of the Sugar Mills and waterfalls and treks in the Escambray mountainsCarefully restored mansions of the welltodo have been turned into museums while art galleries craft shops and restaurants occupy additional lovely old buildings No traffic not even bicycles can cope well with Trinidads wildly uneven cobbled street surfaces so peace reignsespecially before and after the tourbus hordes arrive Few telltale signs of the th century have as yet encroached on this wonderfully somnolent outpost At night the old town is coffinquiet For the tranquillity alone it is worth staying one night or more in TrinidadThe old town clusters around the Plaza Mayor an incomparably pretty square of painted railings fanciful urns greyhound statues and bright colonial buildings To the left of the comparatively plain church Iglesia de la Santsima Trinidad the Museo Romntico is closed for restoration at least through  The squares two other little museums both have attractive courtyards and cool interiors The Museo de Arqueologa exhibits bones of Indians and slaves along with a few stuffed animals while the Museo de Arquitectura Colonial has examples of woodwork ironwork stained glass and other items culled from colonial houses in townA block north of the Plaza Mayor is the Museo Nacional de la Lucha Contra Bandidos National Museum of the Struggle against the Bandits housed in a former convent The bandits in question were counterrevolutionary rebels who hid in the Escambray mountains during the s The stupendous degree view from the yellow belltower a landmark is the big drawA block south of Plaza Mayor on Calle Simn Bolivar stands the grand Palacio Cantero built in  Painted pillars scrolls shells pediments and drapes embellish the interior eclipsing the historical artifacts and old furniture that now form the Museo Municipal de Historia It has its own fine tower though climbing its rickety narrow steps can be a trial if a group has arrived there firstThe tiny Piro Guinart cigar factory on Maceo at the corner of Coln has only about  hand rollers and allows visitors to take a peek inside A block south of the Plaza Mayor are two streets completely given over to sellers of handmade lace and other craftsAimless wandering is especially fruitful in Trinidadand since dozens of street names have changed and neither maps nor residents seem sure of what to call many of them roaming without a plan is the only practical solution Virtually every street is its own colonial treasure and feast for the eyes Near the bus station you might stumble across the musical septet Los Pinos jamming in the street just out of reach of kids playing stickball Farther afield southeast along Calle J M Mrquez youll find Ermita de Santa Ana a brickedup church overlooking the town on a hill where boys fly homemade kitesAround TrinidadTrinidads prosperity in the th century came from the fruits of  sugar mills nearby in the scenic Valle de los Ingenios Valley of the Sugar Mills like Trinidad a UNESCO World Heritage Site A mirador lookout with spectacular views is just  km  miles out of town Just  km  miles farther east is the ManacasIznaga where you can explore a lovely colonial hacienda house and its startling rocketshaped Torre de ManacasIznaga From the top of the tower the Iznaga family would keep watch over their slaves toiling in the fields If you dont have a car you can hire a private taxi for about US roundtrip A special thcentury steam train used in the sugar trade traverses the whole valley for tourists if it is functioning it is a must The train leaves from Estacin Dragones  km  mile from the city center at am and returns at noonBeach worshippers should head to Playa Ancn about  km  miles from Trinidad an excellent strip of white sand and clear waters Here youll find diving at an offshore coral reef a good choice of watersports and two hotels popular with package tourists Again you can hire a taxi or pick up a bicycle rental give it a test ride first as many are so primitive that they would be scoffed at by any selfrespecting commuter from Hanoi or Beijing Another good beach and fishing excursion offered by Rumbos Tours is the daytrip to the tiny island of Cayo Blanco from Playa AncnSierra del EscambrayMore compact than the eastern and western ranges on the island the Sierra del Escambray Escambray mountains coated in luxuriant vegetation are arguably Cubas most beautiful range and easily accessible Blessed with their own microclimate the mountains are a blessedly cool refuge from TrinidadTo get to the Topes de Collantes national park take the road west of Trinidad for the steep km mile climb through dense forests of palms eucalyptus and pines Youll pass a health resort a Stalinesque complex that boasts decent facilities but lacks life Like rewards at the end of excellent day hikes there are two beautiful waterfalls Salto de Caburn at  m  ft and Salto Vega Grande Wear sturdy shoes as each is a steep trek of  km  miles along a narrow and often muddy trail You can swim in the chilly natural pools underneath the falls For Caburn park at the graffitiinfested Casa de Gallo and hit the trail nearby Jeep excursions can be hired US per person at the Rumbos tourism office in Trinidad Calle Simn Bolvar  Theres a US admission fee just beyond the Kurhotel health resortSancti SpiritusFew tourists make it to this provincial capital and it isnt likely to detain you for more than a couple of hours Approximately  km  miles east of Trinidad is Sancti Spiritus one of Velzquezs seven original townships However its only likely to entertain you for an hour or twoFrom the towns pleasant Plaza Snchez wander two blocks south to the main sight Iglesia Parroquial Mayor de Espritu Santo This venerable towered church has foundations from  making it the countrys oldest though the present stone church in fact was built in  Nearby is the Puente Yayabo an early thcentury bridge that recalls Romanesque bridges in Europe From the river take the lovely twisting street Calle Llano a cobblestoned affair festooned with graceful colonial houses in soft pastels and iron grilles The nearby Museo de Arte Colonial Calle Plcido Sur  is an thcentury palace with two peaceful courtyards and a succession of grandly furnished rooms suffused with a gentle light entering through stainedglass windowsCayo Coco and Cayo GuillermoThese offshore caysbudding starlets of Cuban jointtourism initiatives with foreign companiesare reached by a road carving through pineapple orchards and the town of Morn which is not as idiotically named as you might think The road becomes a causeway across the Baha de Perros its so long  km miles that you cant see the land at the far end as you set offCayo Coco is named not for coconuts but for a bird the ibis as revealed in Hemingways Islands in the Stream The author patrolled these shores in World War II on the lookout for Nazis Ibises and other wading birds often pink flamingoes can be seen balancing in the brackish waters around the principal causeway and a smaller causeway connecting the cay to Cayo GuillermoIts the superb impossibly white sandy beaches the intensely blue waters and the excellent fishing that draw travelers and theres not much else to distract you Both cays are covered in forest or thick undergrowth and there are no settlements whatsoever the only Cubans who visit are workers Plans are afoot to build hotels all along the  km  miles of shellshaped beaches on Cayo Coco but accommodations are currently limited A wide range of nonmotorized watersports are available to hotel guests diving and safaris are popular Cayo Guillermos single hotel offers a similar gamut of watersports alongside the shallowest of waters If you hire a moped or Jeep from either hotel there are virgin beaches to discoverCamageyAbout  km  miles southeast of Havana Camagey is a bustling but attractive and comfortable colonial city its population of  is Cubas third largest Restrained old faades hide picturesque courtyards and there are some halfdozen squares each boasting a crumbling and still functioning old churchThe cattlegrazed plains of the province of Camagey hold little water so long ago the citizens fashioned enormous earthenware pots to catch and store rainwater Called tinajones these still adorn many squares and courtyard patiosThe citys most famous son a general from the Ten Years War was born in  at the Casa Natal de Ignacio Agramonte a handsome early thcentury mansion in the city center on Plaza de los Trabajadores The patriot is remembered through personal effects he met his death in battle in  Visit La Merced church opposite to see peeling frescoes and the venerated objects stored in the cryptA dashing equine statue of Agramonte forms the centerpiece of Parque Agramonte just to the south The cathedral occupies one side of the park and the Casa de la Trova see page  around a floral patio features musical performances afternoon and eveningA tenminute walk west down Calle Cristo brings you to a dignified thcentury church Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje Christ of Good Travels perfectly named for outoftown visitors Behind the church is a great sea of crosses and marble saints in a picturesque cemetery church officials claim it is wholly unrelated to travels that didnt go so well A few blocks north the Convento de Nuestra Seora del Carmen from the early th century was in a disastrous state in early  though workers were busily rebuilding it Just enough of the structure remains to make plain that it would be stunning if carefully restoredCamageys finest featureand marvelously restoredis Plaza San Juan de Dios an angular old cobblestoned square surrounded by brightly hued singlestory buildings dating from the th century plus a lovely yellow church alongside a restored former hospital Its one of Cubas most beautiful plazas A few blocks south near the river is an impressive agricultural market open every day and stocked with a surprising surfeit of meat and producePlaya Santa LucaAn hourandahalf drive  km miles from Camagey on the north coast remote Playa Santa Luca beckons sun worshippers with resort hotels strung along a particularly fine peninsular strip of sand Each hotel backs directly onto the beach A superb coral reef lies offshore and diving here is excellent Aside from a couple of roadside bars however nightlife is limited to hotel entertainment The only other drawback is the mosquitoes as voracious as anywhere on the islandTo counter the isolation of Playa Santa Luca the tourist authorities offer a wide range of excursions including a rodeo at Rancho King deepsea fishing and boat and helicopter trips for days on the beach at such unspoiled cays as Cayo Sabinal and Cayo Saeta A bus service visits Playa Los Cocos some  km  miles away with sheltered aquamarine waters its a strong contender for the title of Cubas most beautiful beach Adjacent is La Boca a very small community of waterside shacks with fish restaurantsOriente The EastPrior to the revolution the east of Cuba was a single province known simply as Oriente East and most Cubans still refer to the region with this name Oriente incorporates the postrevolutionary provinces of Holgun Granma Santiago de Cuba and Guantnamo which are scenically and historically more interesting than most of central Cuba The stunning landscapes vary from the north coasts exuberant banana and coconut groves clustered round thatched huts little changed from Indian bohos to the towering peaks of the Sierra Maestra mountains and lush rainforest on the east coast Some of Cubas best beaches lie on the north coast of Oriente within sight of the mountainsThe wars of independence began in Oriente in the s and nearly a century later Castro concentrated his power base in the inaccessible Sierra Maestra There are stirring monuments and museums recalling these periods in Santiago de Cuba the latter dubbed Hero City for its many historic patriotsThe farther east you travel in Cuba the more Caribbean it feels Santiago de Cuba is renowned for its contributions to Cuban musical culture many of the greats of traditional sounds Tro Matamoros La Vieja Trova Santiaguera and Eliades Ochoa among others all got their starts here It continues to be the one place in Cuba where infectious music is inescapableHolgun ProvinceHolgun province begins bleakly around the busy capital but improves considerably as you travel north where the countryside is lusher Guardalavaca  km  miles from Holgun is perhaps Cubas prettiest resort ringed by banana plantations and facing a gorgeous beach backed by a forest of seagrape trees Watersports are excellent here and at the equally picturesquebut isolatedbeach of Estero Ciego  km  miles west The resorts reputation is growing fast and the Cuban government envisions it one day competing with Varadero It is still in the early stages of development and thankfully extremely relaxedThere are plenty of possibilities for excursions in the vicinity of Guardalavaca To the west is Baha de Bariay which has a monument claiming Columbuss landing a fact contested chiefly by Baracoa farther east Beyond the bay is Gibara  km miles north of Holgun a captivating if sleepy little port town You can take a boat trip into the middle of Baha de Naranjo to a simple aquarium where you can swim with the dolphinsAbout  km  miles south of Guardalavaca on a hill amid a forest of lofty palms and thatched homesteads is Chorro de Mata the Caribbeans most important excavated Indian burial ground Of the  skeletons on display dating from  to  more than  were disinterred those in preconquest graves lie in a fetal position while postconquest skeletons lie in a Christian pose outstretched with arms folded Thick banana groves coat the hillsides along the scenic km mile route south to Banes a tumbledown town of clapboard houses with corrugated roofs Fidel Castro was married at the church here in  and the towns Museo IndoCubano has fascinating finds from Chorro de MataSantiago de CubaMany visitors prefer Cubas second city population  to the capital Santiago de Cuba  km miles southeast of Havana is unpolished has few grand palaces and cannot compare with the colonial treasures found in Havana and Trinidad But it is unfailingly vibrant and seductive exuding a feel all its own Enclosed by the Sierra Maestra mountains Santiago can also be wickedly hot Santiagueros negotiate their hilly streets by keeping to the shady sides and they relax with little urgency on overhanging balconiesSantiago is Cubas melting pot with a friendly population of predominantly mulatto people descendants of Spanish French from Haiti Jamaicans and huge numbers of African slaves AfroCuban traditions remain strong reflected in music walk down any street and a cacophony of sounds emanates from unseen sources and particularly in carnaval now a pale shadow of its former selfdue to lack of resourcesbut still Cubas bestFounded in  Santiago was the islands capital until  It is regarded as a heros city and locals are proud of the citys rebellious past Seminal events brought it centerstage again during the s when it assumed a major role in the revolutionary struggle The attack on Batistas forces at the Moncada Barracks in  thrust Fidel Castro into the national limelight and it was in Santiagos main square that he first declared victory on  January An industrial city Santiago was hit especially hard when Cuba lost its Soviet support and Eastern bloc trade partners during the Special Period Perhaps for this reason hustlers and prostitutes work overtime here to zero in on tourists generosityOld SantiagoThe most atmospheric part of the city is Old Santiago Castro delivered his victory speech in the heart of the old town from the balcony of city hall on Parque Cspedes More a plaza than a park the attractive square is a genteel place with tall trees gas lanterns and iron benches Old Santiagos grid of streets unfolds here a few blocks inland from the heavily industrialized harbor Parque Cspedes is dominated by its twintowered cathedral A basilica was built on this spot in  but what you see was rebuilt in the early th century after a series of earthquakes and firesOn the west side of the plaza is the seriously handsome Casa Diego Velzquez built in  as the residence of the founder of Cubas original seven villas The oldest house in Cuba and considered one of the oldest in the Americas it is in remarkable condition Housing the Museo Colonial its rooms overflow with fine period furniture and carved woodwork and encircle two lovely courtyards Guides touch everything in the house practically imploring you to sit on the furniture Try to disregard the poorly realized reproductions of original wall murals around the courtyardAcross the square is the elegant Hotel Casa Granda which opened in  Its terrace bar on the fifth floor affords excellent views of the cathedral towers and the city beyondEast from the square Calle Heredia is the epicenter of Santiago culture and tourism The citys famous Casa de la Trova music hall which has hosted nearly all legendary Cuban musicians is the centerpiece of both Starting in midmorning a succession of groups perform every style of Cuban music from son and guarachas to boleros and salsa Evenings in the intimate openair space inside are the place to be Calle Heredia is lined day and night with artisans and souvenir sellersDown the street is the Museo del Carnaval a museum containing instruments photos and artifacts from Santiagos carnival It also usually has AfroCuban music on weekends as does the Artex store up the street Also on Calle Heredia is the Casa Natal de Jos Mara Heredia a cultural center and the birthplace of the Cuban poet who gave his name to this muchtrafficked streetNearby on Calle Po Rosado the Museo Emilio Bacard has wideranging art archaeological and more recent historical collections including a small grotesque collection of mummies The museum in a shockingly grandiose neoclassic building on a beguiling little street is named for its benefactor and the towns former mayor whose family founded the Bacard rum empire which moved its headquarters and production to Puerto Rico after the revolutionOne of Santiagos most delightful peoplewatching spots is Plaza Dolores a shady plaza lined with colonialera homes several of which are now curiously empty tourist restaurants Avenida Jos A Saco more commonly called Enramada is Santiagos main shopping thoroughfare whose faded s neon signs and ostentatious buildings recall more prosperousand capitalisttimes Cobbled Calle Bartolom Mas also known as San Basilio just behind Heredia and the cathedral is a delightful street that leads to the picturesque Tivol neighborhoodIn Tivol youll find the famous Padre Pico steps named for a Santiaguero priest who aided the citys poor Castro once roared fire and brimstone down on the Batista government here but today youll find more pacific chess and domino players who have set up allhours tables on the steps Take the steps up to the Museo de la Lucha Clandestina the Museum of the Clandestine Struggle This excellent museum in one of the citys finest colonial houses focuses on the activities of the resistance movement under local martyr Frank Pas Residents of Santiago were instrumental in supporting the revolution as were peasants in the Sierra Maestra From the museums balcony there are tremendous views of Santiago and the bay and unfortunately of plumes of pollution rising up from illplaced industrial plantsNot far from the museum is one of Santiagos best places to get sweaty in the evening The Casa de las Tradiciones a cultural center in a sweet little pink house Calle General Lacret  has live music and as much dancing as its tiny space will allow Its great fun and the locals usually outnumber the touristsJust west of the Padre Pico steps south of the train station is the oneroom Csar Escalante cigar factory unimpressive by comparison with other Cuban cigar factories but still an enjoyable place to visit and the Ron Caney rum factory The oldest rum distillery in the country it was established in  by Don Facundo Bacard whose descendants fled the country in  and nationalized the following year The rum produced here now goes under the name Havana Club You can visit only a small museum and barAround SantiagoA good place to get your bearings on the suburbs of the city is from the rooftop bar of the lavish hotel Cubanacn Santiago  km almost  miles east of the citys center In the near distance you can make out the yellow Moncada Barracks which Castro along with some  rebels attacked on  July  The date is now a rallying cry and public holiday and the barracks have been converted into a school and museum The museum tells the story of the road to revolution using dozens of memorable photographs Also on display are various bloodstained rebel uniforms some of Fidels personal effects from his time in the mountains and  Julio armbands sporting the name of the resistance movement that developed after the Moncada attack The bullet holes over the entrance are just for showNorth of Moncada beyond the bus station is the Plaza de la Revolucin a frighteningly polluted open square at the corner of Av las Amricas and Av de los Libertadores Massive spears thrust toward the sky in this monument to Antonio Maceo a hero of the war of independence who is seen riding triumphantlyThe fine Cementerio Santa Ifigenia just north of the harbor Av Crombel and Reparto Juan Gmez is the resting place of many Cuban heroes Pride of place goes to the Cuban founding father Jos Mart in a vast octagonal mausoleum designed so that the tomb catches the sun throughout the day Look also for the tombs of Cspedes and Frank Pas Franks as santiagueros refer to him is marked like many others with the Cuban flag and the flag of the  July movementIn an impressive setting  km  miles from the city is the th century El Morro Castle surveying the harbor mouth from a commanding clifftop position Moated thickly walled and full of cannons drawbridges and passageways it is in excellent condition One room houses displays on pirates through the ages A guide will point out a torture room with a trap door in the floor through which uncooperative prisoners and slaves were reportedly dropped to the sea below Thats not a terribly appetizing thought but the restaurant just beyond the castle also called El Morro has gorgeous views of the sea and some of Santiagos finest food its a great place to get out of the intense sun The easiest way to get to El Morro is to hire a taxi which costs about US roundtrip the driver will wait for up to a couple hours while you explore the castle and even eat lunchA place of great import and considerable beauty to all Cubans is the tripledomed Baslica del Cobre named after the nearby copper mines that rise out of the forested foothills  km  miles west of Santiago Cuban faithful make annual pilgrimages to the church to pay tribute to its statue of a black virgin the Virgen de la Caridad Virgin of Charity According to legend Cubas patron saint was rescued bobbing in the sea in the th century by three young fishermen about to capsize in a storm With the wooden statue in their grasp they miraculously made it to shore Pilgrims often making the last of the trek on their knees pray to her image and place mementos and offerings of thanks for her miracles among them are small boats and prayers for those who have tried to escape Cuba on rafts The Virgen is on the second floor encased in glass and cloaked in a glittering gold robeYou can take a taxi to El Cobre for around US roundtrip although more adventurous sorts can hop a mquina vintage American automobile taxi or colectivo bus or truck out to the town and walk the mile or so to the church If youd like to stay overnight in this spectacular and deathly peaceful area there is a hostal Hospedera de la Caridad behind the church where foreigners who abide by the strict rules can stay for a mere five pesos a night see page East of Santiago is Parque Baconao a biosphere reserve spread over  km  miles The local darksand beaches can be scrubby and the hotels themselves are isolated but theres lots to explore in the park and the Sierra de La Gran Piedra rise majestically above the coastA tortuous side road  km  miles east along the coast ascends the mountains to La Gran Piedra Big Stone where you can climb on foot for a birdseye view of eastern Cuba About  km about a mile beyond a passable dirt track leads to Museo La Isabelica a thcentury coffeeplantation finca country house with a workshop original furniture and a concrete garden where coffee beans were once laid out to dryGuantnamo ProvinceYou can reach Cubas remote mountainous fareastern region by continuing along the coast road from Parque Baconao on a memorablebut gooddirt track and paved road alternatively you can backtrack to Santiago The province has only one true tourist draw but its a super one the magical little town of Baracoa The only reason to stop over in the unappealing city of Guantnamo would be to visit the lookout point that is trained on the American naval baseThe dry cactusstrewn landscape of the south coast begins to change as you follow the winding spectacular km mile road La Farola across the mountains to Baracoa  km miles from Santiago a picturesque little village known for its local chocolate and coconut factories The tropical seaside town is surrounded by green hillsides covered with cocoa and coconut groves and all around are palmbacked beaches and delightful sinewy rivers Named a UNESCO biosphere Baracoa has no fewer than ten rivers Its smack in the middle of the wettest region in Cuba the reason adventure travelers have their scopes trained on the towns rivers ripe for whitewater raftingThat Baracoa was the first settlement to be established by Diego Velzquez in making it the oldest colonial city in the Americasis not in doubt However locals also claim that Columbus first landed at this spot rather than near Gibara north and west of here as most historians believe They insist that Columbus planted the Cruz de la Parra Cross of the Vine in the soil on his arrival The cross is on display in Nuestra Seora de la Asuncin the church on Plaza Independencia Whatever the truth of the matter carbon dating has established that the cross is more than  years oldBaracoa though has so much going for it that any associations with Columbus are a bonus A good place to get your bearings is the hilltop Hotel El Castillo a former castle looking out over old redtiled roofs the towns oystershaped bay and the landmark mountain known as El Yunque The Anvil so named on account of its singular shapeOn Calle Antonio Maceo youll find people queuing for hot chocolate drinks in the baking tropical sun at Casa del Chocolate Opposite is a charming Casa de la Trova with rooftop performances In the main square is a striking bust of Hatuey the brave Indian leader who resisted early conquistadores until he was caught by the Spanish and burned at the stake Also wander along the Malecn the seaside avenue from the snug Fuerte Matachn an early thcentury fort that has a small municipal museum attached to the Hotel La Rusa named after a legendary and glamorous Russian migre who over the years hosted celebrities from Che and Fidel to Errol FlynnIn and around Baracoa are several dozen preColombian archaeological sites related to the three major Indian groups that inhabited the town at one time or another Only one native group the Yateras still existsBaracoa really shines the week of  April when heady street parties every night commemorate the date General Antonio Maceo disembarked at nearby Playa Duaba in  marking the beginning of Cubas War of Independence
