   GreenCheese and Keynes                        Professor Paul KrugmanThe DismalScientist has done me the honor of another attack this time for analleged vulgarization of the great British economist John Maynard Keynes            The odd thing is that Pauland I actually agree more or less on the policy question I favor a lowinterest rate Paul doesnt say quite as much But he does concede that it isOK intellectually speaking to quarrel with Alan Greenspans judgment Thismay be the closest Ill get to having Pauls explicit endorsement on thisimportant issue and Ill take it with pleasure            Paul and I also agree thatthe way to get lower interest rates is for the Federal Reserve to cut themThis is what the German central banker Hans Tietmayer always calls with severedisapproval the easy way out I definitely favor the easy way out when it isavailable            Our argument begins withPauls assertion that Keynes had some contrary and different view Krugmanseems to be saying that Keynes overlooked the importance of monetary policy tothe determination of the interest rate He writes that Keynes held a liquiditypreference theory of the interest rate according to which in Krugmansversion markets for money and bonds determined the interest rate withmonetary policy playing no visible role            This misrepresents Keyneswho understood centralbank powers extremely well Among other things Keyneshad wielded those powers himself for all practical purposes at the BritishTreasury during World War I Later he was a vociferous opponent of tightBritish monetary policy during the s            Liquidity preference thoughimportant in Keynes is not a full theory of the interest rate It is only atheory of the demand for moneyof the choice between holding illiquid bondsand liquid cash In order to get from money demand to a full theory of theinterest rate you need a theory of money supply Keynes was well aware ofthis and his view of the supply situation was more or less the same as Paulsor mine The central bank supplies the liquidity money that speculatorsdemand The terms on which it does so combined with the demand conditionstogether determine the interest rate            Keynes therefore understoodperfectly well that a low interestrate policy requires an accommodatingcentral bank If people increase their demand for money then either interestrates must rise cutting investment or transactions must fall cutting outputand employmentunless the central bank acts The problem Keynes wrote wasthat people desire the moona perfectly safe place to store their wealthThe solution in Keynes own metaphor is to persuade them that green cheeseis nearly as good and to have a greencheese factorya centralbankconveniently at hand            Now if Keynesinterestrate theory is not so easily written off perhaps we should also lookagain at that paradox of thrift That argument which holds that the attempt toraise saving will end up lowering national income because consumption willfall and with it profits output and employment Was Keynes also right whenhe warned against excessive saving            Paul shrinks from this viewHe wants to maintain the tidy and comfortable belief beloved by Victorians ofall epochs that thrift is always a virtue I know that he also strongly favorsa reduction in the federal budget deficit precisely because that represents arise in socalled national savings Paul agrees that such a rise in nationalsavings might have some tendency to depress the economy along lines of Keynesmultiplier model But sinceaccording to Krugmanthe Federal Reserve cancontrol output and unemployment he believes that this tendency is easilyoffset by cuts in interest rates to hold employment steady            This is Pauls second errorin my view It is one thing to assume that the Federal Reserve could inprinciple always lower interest rates enough to offset the depressing effectsof tax increases and spending cuts But in fact there is no assurance thatGreenspan and his colleagues have any actual intention of behaving in this waynor any persuasive evidence that they have done so in the past Paulsstatement that this is simple and reasonable does not make it right            Paul seems to regard AlanGreenspan as an ideologue who actually does control the unemployment rateaccording to the dictates of some economic theory Greenspan himself hasrepeatedly denied this and I believe him I think that Greenspan is a nimblepolitical figure no more nor less That being so the main reason we have highinterest rates is that the forces favoring them are more powerful than theforces opposed This I believe is the deplorable truth            In October  recallCongress took drastic action to raise national saving by cutting the expectedfuture budget deficits in half But the Federal Reserve then raised interestrates beginning in February  an action rationalized by entirely spuriousfears of inflation The raising of interest rates went on for  months wasnever fully reversed and actually raised federal spending on interest paymentsby enough to wipe out a large part of the deficit reductions            That  experience provedthat one cannot rely on the Federal Reserve to offset the workings of theparadox of thrift That being so excess saving is a danger just as Keyneswarned Analytically Keynes theory is right and Krugmans revision of it isbased on a false premise And the way to get lower interest rates and moreinvestment and durable consumption spending and lower unemployment all ofwhich I favor is not to increase thriftiness or to cut deficits The essentialthing is to get the Federal Reserve to bring interest rates down            Paul and do I agree on oneother thing It is very hard to improve on Keynes and more people should readhim When they do so they will find that parable of the widows cruseamarvelous tidbit on the rewards of vigorous consumption spending as opposed toparsimony niggardliness and thrift But speaking of vulgarity they ought toknow that this is not from some old folk tale as Krugman writes The sourceis actually the Bible  Kings  And the barrel of meal wasted notneither did the cruse of oil fail            Youdthink a good Keynesian economist would know that                           James K GalbraithLBJSchool of Public AffairsThe University of Texas at

addressed Why Paul Mellon is missingfrom the list And Walter Annenberg Also Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariridonated  million to the Boston University School of Management last year forits new building That is a big donation from a foreign politician            No  Alfred Slifka doesnot belong to a New York City family of realestate developers and investmentmanagers Instead Slifka is a

Ann Castles replyOne of the important lessons Ive learned since we started the Slate project isto be open to change especially in an entrepreneurial effort like this oneAnother equally important message is that no matter how carefully we try tocraft categories of giving human behavior refuses to be comprehensivelycategorized I find that reassuring            We didnt include the Haririgift because it came from a nonAmerican citizen There were several very largeones made both in the United States and outside the United States last year Wemay consider changing that guideline this year or we may do a feature on giftsfrom nonAmerican citizens to institutions here and abroad            We also decided to list giftsonly in the years the actual gift was announced not when payments were made onpreviously announced pledges This accounts for a number of missing foundationgifts I did not do a mailing last year to private foundations or to anyonefor that matter to compile the list Ive changed that procedure this year Irelied on what I could find in public sources and sometimes foundation giftsare not as wellpublicized We were quite open about this in the Introduction to theSlate             As for the background onSlifka I took that information straight from a news story I have learned thatI need to verify everything and that even the most reliable sources areoccasionally wrong            We willstick with our decision to list gifts as they are announced and wont listgifts made to create or add to private foundations Again we may address thistype of giving in a separate feature We will only list gifts from a privatefoundation to an actual grantee We are always looking for ideas of how to makethe Slate  even more useful than it has proved to be so far                           InDefense of the New York Suburbs                        Attention really should bedrawn to Nicholas Lemanns incredible article on suburban New York The Suburbs HaveWon If I was forced to pick one and only one favorite bit I think Iwould have to go with the equation of Starbucks coffee shops withsophisticationperhaps the single most novel irreverent idea Ive ever readin Slate Not that I wouldnt be mighty tempted by Lemanns pining for aMerchantIvorytype movie theater mind you You of course are free to divein and pick your own favorite strand of drivel            Lemann then goes on toexplain that New York has no suburbs that are truly hip He doesnt favor uswith a definition of truly hip but he is kind enough to drop some cluesA truly hip suburb no thats not oxymoronicgo visit West Lake HillsTexas or Berkeley or Topanga Calif where there would be leaflets stapledto the telephone poles and vegetarian restaurants and rave clubs is completelyout of the question in New York Never having been to either West Lake Hillsor Topanga I can only go on the little Lemann gives us to grasp what makes aplace truly hip but let me go ahead and see if I dont have the wholepictureuh upperclass white Protestant children with dreadlocks tattoosand nascent heroin addictions playing in bad rock bands named after legendarys TV sitcoms Bookstores with lots of Noam Chomsky Loud ironyfreediscussions of Irony Burrito delivery Am I in the ballpark Close Well geeI guess if thats truly hip then suburban New York does come up sorely            What can I tell you The NewYork suburbs are largely the product of the migration of whiteethnic CatholicJewish and AfricanAmericans and now AsianAmericans and Latinos from thecity of New York People who were or are by and large at most onegeneration removed from poverty People who were or are as they say shapedby that experience If one judges their communities by the standards of middleand upperclass WASP bohemians from Middle America Starbucks coffee shops andvegetarian restaurants yeah theyre going to come up short            Since Lemanns claim to fameis that he wrote a page book explaining to prepschooleducated liberalsthat many black people used to live in the South this refusal to address basicsociology is glaring There are a lot of awful things to be said about suburbanNew York but Lemann is clearly not the person to make the case for or againsta region of the country he simply does not understand And of course it isntall bad            Take for instance ohfood The food here is really good Really really good Turns out the rest ofAmerica isnt full of bakeries and pizzerias And hour diners anddelicatessens that cut giant chunks of meat with scary slicing machines Not tomention the thousands of fine relatively inexpensive ethnic restaurants Irealize that Lemann is partial to giant homogenized chains but some of us arestill content to eat in independently owned restaurants I guess were just notas sophisticated            Then theres the matter ofour cultural influence which is huge and by no means entirely benign evenif its full magnitude isnt always appreciated by the NPR crowd Nassau Countyalone has given the world Eddie Murphy Howard Stern Rosie ODonnell andJerry Seinfeldfour comedians who for better or worse probably shape thecutting edge of our national culture more than Charlotte NC and BerkeleyCalif and Austin Texas and all the truly hip suburbs with a patina ofsophistication combined            Lemannssilly misinformed article completely ignores issues of class and ethnicitywhile presenting the giant chain stores of mall America Borders Starbucksand the passing trends of middle America upperclass youth leaflets ontelephone poles Anglophile raves as some sort of ideal His problem with thesuburbs of New York would seem to be that they have too much New York and notenough suburb All in alljust a really dumb piece                           MichaelLangnas                                       West LakeHills Is Not Hip                        I cant think of a moresophisticated way to begin so Ill just blurt it out West Lake Hills Texasis in no way shape or form a hip suburb no matter what Nick Lemann says inThe Suburbs HaveWon Im from West Lake Hills I left my parents and brother behind when Imoved five years ago but I still visit frequently and I have to tell youtheres not a vegetarian restaurant in sight A notice for a rave party wouldsend an army of cellphonewaving parents into the school counselors officeand church hallways demanding action After of course said parents learnedwhat a rave party was            West LakeHills is a pretty place lots of wood stone and gorgeous views of LakeAustin The new Albertsons supermarket is great fun to shop ingood coffeefresh herbs and reasonably good focaccia bread But in all that lovelyexpensive real estate theres no edge no irony no one dressed in blackeven Its certainly no Berkeley Which I suspect is why my parents stilllive there Its also why I dont                           JenniferBradley                                       FreshBrewed Influence                        The oneissue that James J Cramer avoids in his article I Had Coffee WithClinton is the fact that had he not given money to the Democratic NationalCommittee or the president he would not have had the opportunity to sit nextto the president and discuss his stockoption idea Its not what he may or maynot have been shaken down for that day but what he paid for the price ofadmission Access to the president should be for all Why are someones ideasmore important than mine because they gave money to the president or hisparty             Joe Strupek                                       Train inVain                        In Jacob Weisbergs review ofCharles Murrays What It Means to Be a Libertarian The Other LWordhe states But if government cant reroute the freight train in a betterdirection its hard to see how it can derail it As an engineer I feelqualified to point out that rerouting requires new track and a switch not tomention a new destination before the train arrives Derailing can be done witha few common chemicals or tools remove a short section of rail or a towstrap and vehicle simply pull the rail out of line a few inches            In truth most governmentprograms actually accomplish the opposite of the goals they are intended toachieve Thus welfare has created a group of permanent dependents gun controlhas increased gunrelated crime and the war on drugs has created an immenselyprofitable drug trade Weisberg incorrectly states the nonaggression principleas no one can use force against anyone else The proper statement is No onemay initiate force against another The difference is obvious when consideringselfdefense            Also in writing aboutLibertarianism A Primer  by David Boaz he states that Boazs modelfor this is the Internet and asserts that he neglects of course the factthat the Internet began life as a federal defense project Granted theInternets grandfather was DARPANET This may be one of the no more than sixcases where a government project went right DARPANET was intentionallydesigned as a decentralized network in order to as much as possible ensuresurvivability in the event of World War III The current Internet stilldecentralized has become a worldwide threat to authoritarian government dueto the free exchange of ideas it allows This explains the recent spate ofgovernmental and intergovernmental attacks on the Net            In allWeisberg displays an abysmal ignorance of what libertarianism is and whatlibertarian goals mean to We the People I suggest that he be limited toreviewing official government pronouncements in the future This may be theonly arena in which he can operate comfortably                           Earl Warner                                       ALibertarian Quilt                        Jacob Weisberg has it allwrong in his review of Charles Murrays What It Means to Be aLibertarian  He takes the position that he can state and judge What is alibertarianas though there were only one type of libertarian            Thats no more true thansaying there is only one standard by which you can call yourself a CatholicProtestant Jew black white Republican Democrat or any other philosophy orrace            CharlesMurrays view of what it takes to be a libertarian and survive and hope tohave any impact and success in the current political arena is far differentand more appropriate than Weisbergs view Follow Weisberg and youll be in thesticks by yourself and getting nowhere                           Mark Cornell                                       No MoreHot Dogs                        In The AccidentalTheorist Paul Krugman demonstrates his penchant for naive economicanalogies ranging all the way back to the classical argument for free tradethat involved wine and cheeseproducing economies The fact that he recognizesthat people will fault him on the oversimplification of his economicrepresentations doesnt get him off the hook The problem with these analogiesand the reason they are not immediately disposed of is that like Afrocentristhistorical revisionism they are so riddled with problems that one hardly knowswhere to begin            Perhaps we could begin bynoting that the service jobs replacing manufacturing jobs ie selling hotdogs instead of making hot dogs rarely pull the wages of the manufacturingjobs In his earlier work he accepts models that dont even make allowance forthe mechanisms of capitalism Krugmans disdain for evidence is alarming I canwell hear him telling the hungry to simply eat more hot dogs            Krugmanasserts his argument through use of psychology not economic reasoning Namelyif you dont accept my argument then you are a smug highminded sophisticateHe is willing to disregard the growing income inequity in this countryillustrated in my article among other issues and practically admits thatchanges in his playful thought experiments would come only after cataclysmicevidence demonstrates otherwise ie when they are useless Krugman
