                    Background        Aerobic organisms produce intracellular thiols such as        glutathione GSH homoglutathione   glutamylcysteine        GluCys   glutamylcysteinylserine   and        mycothiol   for protection against reactive oxygen        species formed as byproducts of aerobic metabolism GSH is        the most common of these In addition to buffering the        redox status of the cytoplasm and protecting biomolecules        against oxidative damage GSH provides reducing equivalents        to several enzymes including ribonucleotide reductase          phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase   and        arsenate reductase   and serves as a substrate for        glutathione         S transferases which detoxify        potentially dangerous electrophiles        GSH is found primarily in Gramnegative bacteria and        eukaryotes and only rarely in Grampositive bacteria        Figure  It is not found in the Archaea or in        amitochondrial eukaryotes such as         Entamoeba histolytica           Giardia duodenalis           Trichomonas vaginalis   and         Trichomonas foetus   This        distinctive pattern led to the proposal that the genes for        GSH biosynthesis may have been transferred to eukaryotes        from bacteria via the progenitor of mitochondria            If this hypothesis is true then the genes for GSH        biosynthesis in eukaryotes should resemble those from        alphaproteobacteria the modern relatives of the        mitochondrial progenitor           The biosynthesis of GSH Figure  requires only two        enzymes GluCys ligase GshA catalyzes the formation of        a peptide bond between the carboxylate of glutamate and        cysteine GSH synthetase GshB catalyzes the subsequent        formation of a peptide bond between the cysteinyl        carboxylate of GluCys and the amino group of glycine        Each of these reactions requires hydrolysis of ATP to drive        formation of the peptide bond        We have analyzed the sequences of genes encoding GshA        and GshB and have discovered that the evolutionary history        of these genes is more complex than expected Our results        are consistent with two possible explanations for the        distribution of GshA genes The most likely possibility is        that GshA arose in the bacterial domain and the gene was        transferred to eukaryotes at an early stage in their        evolution A second less appealing possibility is that a        GshA gene was present in the last common ancestor and was        subsequently lost from many organisms primarily those that        live under anaerobic conditions GshB appears to have        arisen independently within bacteria and eukaryotes        subsequent to the acquisition of the GshA gene Notably in        each domain the scaffold typical of the ATPgrasp        superfamily was utilized to provide GshB Multiple examples        of lateral transfer of the GshA gene are evident the most        dramatic being a transdomain transfer from an        alphaproteobacterium to a plant sometime before         million years ago                    Results and discussion                  GshA sequences fall into three distinct          groups          We assembled an initial set of GshA sequences by          searching the NCBI Protein database   using either          GshA or glutamatecysteine ligase as query words The set          was expanded using the output of BLAST   searches          with the sequences from           Escherichia coli Saccharomyces          cerevisiae and           Arabidopsis thaliana Some of the          sequences found in the BLAST searches correspond to          hypothetical proteins whose functions have not been          experimentally verified For organisms that are known to          synthesize GSH these sequences are likely to encode          GshA However the assignment of function is uncertain          for the sequences from           Mycobacterium tuberculosis          Streptomyces coelicolor and           Clostridium acetobutylicum because          these organisms are not known to synthesize GSH                      The sequences in the GshA set fall into three distinct          groups Table  that have no significant relationship to          each other on the basis of pairwise sequence identities          The first group consists primarily of          gammaproteobacteria the second of nonplant eukaryotes          and the third primarily of flowering plants and          alphaproteobacteria Pairwise sequence identities within          each group range from  to  for group  from  to           for group  and from  to  for group  Group           corresponds to the GCS entry in the Pfam database            The clustering of GshA sequences into three groups was          confirmed using PSIBLAST   PSIBLAST is an          iterative form of BLAST in which sequence information          from hits found with an initial query sequence is          incorporated into a profile that is used in subsequent          searches We carried out PSIBLAST searches using GshA          sequences from           E coli group  gi           Drosophila melanogaster group           gi and           Mesorhizobium loti group           gi In each case PSIBLAST converged within a          few iterations three two and five respectively and          no members of the other groups were found even with          statistically insignificant scores data not shown          Cyanobacterial sequences not shown in Table  are found          in the PSIBLAST output for group  but are quite          distantly related to the other group  sequences          typically less than  sequence identity          The lack of significant overall sequence identity          between the members of these groups could indicate that          these proteins arrived at a common function by convergent          evolution from different progenitors or that the          sequences have diverged so far that evolutionary          relationships are no longer readily apparent For truly          related but very divergent proteins it is often possible          to identify locally conserved regions that are important          for structure andor function Therefore our next          approach was to search for such motifs using Block Maker             It would be ideal to search for motifs with a          divergent set of proteins in which the pairwise          identities are less than about  so that the motifs          found are highly conserved because they are important for          structure andor function However the high pairwise          identities between plant and alphaproteobacterial          sequences in group  made this impossible Using a query          set containing six group  sequences seven group           sequences seven group  sequences and four          cyanobacterial sequences Block Maker identified three          blocks of conserved sequence Figure  A search of the          nonredundant database using a PSSM positionspecific          scoring matrix generated from these blocks retrieved a          total of  sequences with           E values less than  No proteins          with identified functions other than GshA were found with                    E values less than  Thus the          PSSM was very effective at discriminating between GshA          and nonGshA sequences in the database Many of the          sequences were duplicate entries of a single sequence or          sequences from multiple strains of the same organism          Taking this into account the search retrieved           sequences of known or putative GshAs with Evalues less          than  A subset of these sequences representing all          three groups and cyanobacteria is shown in Table  The           p values for each occurrence of          the three motifs as well as the           E values for each sequence are          very low in all three groups These data provide support          for a real but distant relationship between the three          groups of sequences as well as the cyanobacterial          sequences          It is difficult to generate reliable phylogenetic          trees in cases such as this in which only small blocks of          conserved sequence can be identified Figure shows a          tree generated from the three conserved blocks using the          parsimony method in PAUP b   The tree topology          supports the findings reported above in that the          sequences cluster into three distinct groups with the          cyanobacterial sequences being most closely associated          with the group  plant and alphaproteobacteria          sequences The available information does not provide          reliable information about the order of branching within          each of these groups Similar findings were obtained          using the neighborjoining method in PAUP A general          association of eukaryotic and alphaproteobacterial          sequences that would support the hypothesis that the          eukaryotic gene arose by transfer from the mitochondrial          progenitor is not seen The striking association of plant          sequences with alphaproteobacterial sequences will be          addressed below                          Possible explanations for the distribution of GshA          lateral transfer versus massive gene loss          Figure shows the distribution of known and putative          GshA genes mapped onto a universal tree of life generated          using rRNA sequences Two possible scenarios could          account for the observed pattern of distribution First          a GshA gene might have arisen early in either the          bacterial or eukaryotic lineage and undergone a lateral          transfer to the other domain Alternatively a GshA gene          could have been present in the last common ancestor but          have been lost in nearly all Archaea the          deepestbranching eukaryotes and many bacteria Although          the possibility of massive loss of GshA at first glance          seems unlikely careful perusal of Figures and reveals          that most of the genera that lack GSH andor GshA lack          aerobic metabolism and therefore do not need GSH for          protection against reactive oxygen species Many Archaea          all of the methanogens as well as           Archaeoglobus Pyrodictium          Thermoproteus and           Thermofilum  are anaerobes           Thermoplasma although          facultatively aerobic respires sulfur rather than          oxygen The deepestbranching eukaryotes            Giardia Trichomonas          Vairimorpha and           Encephalitozoon  lack          mitochondria and therefore aerobic metabolism           Entamoeba histolytica has          apparently lost its mitochondria and now lacks aerobic          respiratory pathways Bacteria such as           Aquifex and           Thermotoga are anaerobes Thus the          possibility of massive gene loss in these lineages is          quite plausible However a problem with this hypothesis          is that it requires that the GshA gene which appears to          be important only to aerobes must have originated in the          last common ancestor before the emergence of O            which occurred only after the          evolution of cyanobacteria about  billion years ago                     The possibility that GshA arose early in the bacterial          lineage and then was transferred to the eukaryotic          lineage and into at least one archaeon            Halobacterium  is perhaps more          appealing GshA may have arisen in cyanobacteria          concomitant with the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis a          particularly attractive hypothesis because this would          have been the first time protection against reactive          oxygen species would have been important Later as          proteobacteria developed aerobic metabolic processes that          took advantage of the growing O            concentration in the atmosphere the          consequent production of reactive oxygen species would          have given a selective advantage to microbes that          acquired a GshA gene by lateral gene transfer from          cyanobacteria GshA would have been advantageous to          aerobic eukaryotes as well providing selective pressure          for the acquisition and retention of a bacterial GshA          gene Transfer of a GshA gene from the          alphaproteobacterial progenitor of mitochondria as          postulated previously     is one possible          mechanism for the spread of GshA into eukaryotes Our          analysis does not show a significant association between          eukaryotic and alphaproteobacterial sequences that would          support this mechanism Figure  However the extreme          divergence of the sequences limits our ability to resolve          phylogenetic relationships so this mechanism remains a          possibility There are other possible mechanisms for an          early transdomain lateral gene transfer as well For          example Doolittle has proposed that protists that          consume bacteria as food may incorporate bacterial genes          into their genomes                            Lateral transfer of GshA genes          Lateral transfer of genes between bacteria is          recognized to occur very frequently especially for genes          involved in metabolism     Lateral transfers          of genes into eukaryotic nuclear DNA from the          alphaproteobacterial progenitor of mitochondria and into          plant nuclear DNA from the cyanobacterial progenitor of          chloroplasts are well documented Only a few other cases          of lateral transfers between domains have been reported          Examples include transfer of the phosphoglucose isomerase          gene from a eukaryote to a bacterium   and          displacement of several aminoacyltRNA synthetases in          parasitic and symbiotic bacteria by eukaryotic and          archaeal counterparts   Our results show clear          evidence of a transdomain transfer of a GshA gene from          alphaproteobacteria to plants Figure shows that the          data provide  bootstrap support to the clustering of          plant sequences with the group  alphaproteobacterial          sequences and Table illustrates the strikingly high          pairwise sequence identities between plant and          alphaproteobacterial sequences Many of the          alphaproteobacteria are either plant pathogens for          example           Agrobacterium tumefaciens  or          plant commensals for example           Sinorhizobium meliloti and           Zymomonas mobilis  The close          physical association between these bacteria and plants          apparently provided an opportunity for lateral transfer          of the GshA gene perhaps more than  million years          ago A partial sequence is available for GshA from the          conifer           Picea abies gi This          sequence has  identity to the           A thaliana sequence and thus          belongs to group  Conifers diverged from the lineage          leading to flowering plants  million years ago            Thus lateral transfer of the alphaproteobacterial          GshA gene may have occurred before the divergence of          conifers Additional sequences from other conifers and          more primitive plants are needed to pin down the timing          of this transfer          Lateral gene transfer from alphaproteobacteria to          plants is particularly intriguing because transfer and          retention of a foreign gene in a sophisticated          multicellular organism is more difficult than in          bacteria Bacteria can acquire DNA from their environment          in multiple ways transformation transduction and          conjugation   Furthermore a transferred gene can          be easily transmitted to progeny after recombination into          genomic or plasmid DNA However known mechanisms for          transfer of DNA into plants are more limited The best          understood mechanism is the transfer of Tstrand DNA from          the Tiplasmid of           Agrobacterium tumefaciens into          wounded plant tissues a process resulting in the          formation of tumors   It is not known whether          foreign genes can be transferred into plants by this          mechanism in nature but such a process is plausible          Perpetuation of a transferred gene is also not as easily          achieved in seed plants as it is in bacteria because the          gene must be incorporated into genomic DNA in apical          meristem cells undifferentiated stem cells that produce          new organs including the cones or flowers that generate          male and female gametes An interesting issue is whether          the group  alphaproteobacterial gene displaced an          ancestral group  eukaryotic gene or whether the          ancestral gene was first lost allowing the          alphaproteobacterial gene to fill the functional          gap          Additional potential cases of lateral gene transfer          are also suggested by our data GshA from           Xylella fastidiosa a          gammaproteobacterium clusters with group  rather than          with the other gammaproteobacterial sequences in group           This organism is a plant pathogen and its physical          association with plants has apparently provided an          opportunity for gene transfer either from a plant or          more likely from an associated alphaproteobacterium          Sequences from           Halobacterium sp NRC archaeon                    Mycobacterium tuberculosis and           Streptomyces coelicolor highGC          Grampositive bacteria and           Streptococcus pneumoniae lowGC          Grampositive bacterium cluster with the plant and          alphaproteobacterial sequences in group  and a          sequence from           Clostridium acetobutylicum a          lowGC Grampositive bacterium clusters with the          gammaproteobacterial sequences in Group  Note that          synthesis of glutamyl cysteine has been demonstrated in                    Halobacterium sp NRC   but          not in           Mycobacterium tuberculosis          Streptomyces coelicolor or           Streptococcus pneumoniae  The          occurrence of GshA homologs in these organisms could          reflect persistence of an ancestral GshA in only some          genera in the Archaea and in the Grampositive bacteria          or could be the result of lateral transfer into a limited          number of organisms As discussed above it is difficult          to distinguish between these two explanations although          the lateral gene transfer hypothesis is most          appealing                          Why are GshA sequences so divergent          The three groups of GshA sequences are so divergent          that it was difficult to demonstrate an evolutionary          relationship between them This level of sequence          divergence is unexpected and warrants some thought          Three obvious factors contribute to divergence of          sequence in orthologs First the organisms being          compared may be very distant This explanation is          probably not sufficient to explain the sequence          divergence in the GshAs The gammaproteobacteria          represented in group  are reasonably closely related to          the alphaproteobacteria in group  and the crown          eukaryotes in group  are reasonably closely related to          the plants in group  Orthologous relationships between          these groups can often be identified Of the  COGs          clusters of orthologous groups     identified          in           P aeruginosa a          gammaproteobacterium  are also found in the          combined group containing           Mesorhizobium loti and           Caulobacter crescentus both          alphaproteobacteria As a specific example the GshB          sequences from           E coli a gammaproteobacterium          and           C crescentus have  identity          and those from           Arabidopsis and human have           identity Detection of orthologs in even more distantly          related organisms is also possible in many cases We have          used PSIBLAST to find orthologs of enzymes that use          glutathione including glutaredoxins glutathione           S transferases glutathione          reductases and glutathione peroxidases in both bacteria          and eukaryotes data not shown          A second reason that homologous sequences may be very          divergent is that little selective pressure has been          required to maintain function at the level required for          the organism to succeed This situation may occur if the          reaction being catalyzed is not very demanding or if the          product of the reaction does not contribute to the          fitness of the organism in an important way An example          of the first scenario is           o succinylbenzoate synthase which          catalyzes the dehydration of          hydroxysuccinylcyclohexadiene carboxylate to          form           o succinylbenzoate synthase in the          biosynthetic pathway for menaquinone synthesis           o Succinylbenzoate synthases from          various organisms have very low pairwise sequence          identities compared to those seen for other members of          the enolase superfamily The low sequence identities in          these enzymes have been interpreted as reflecting          relatively low constraints upon the sequence because the          reaction is quite facile even in the absence of the          enzyme because it forms an aromatic product and thus          the enzyme is not required to provide a great deal of          assistance   This scenario is unlikely to account          for the divergence of the GshA genes as formation of a          peptide bond is a quite difficult reaction In fact          members of the ATPgrasp superfamily that catalyze          comparable reactions that is GshBs see further below          ribosomal S modification enzymes DAlaDAla ligases          are sufficiently well conserved to be easily detected by          PSIBLAST even though they utilize different substrates            With respect to the second scenario it is clear          that the ability to synthesize GSH provides a significant          advantage Bacteria and yeast that lack functional GshA          are viable but are hypersensitive to oxidative damage             GshAdeficient strains of           A thaliana are viable but are          hypersensitive to cadmium   Mice in which GluCys          ligase has been knocked out die before gestational day             Thus low selection pressure cannot account for          the high levels of divergence among the GshA          sequences          Finally sequences of homologs may diverge if they are          subject to different selective pressures in different          lineages This might occur if the protein has a second          function a moonlighting function in some lineages and          is subject to selective pressure that alters regions of          the protein involved in that function Alternatively if          a protein interacts with other proteins then differences          in those partner proteins will drive changes in the          regions of the protein involved in the interaction The          possibility that the high level of divergence in GshA          proteins is due to one of these factors is intriguing and          worth experimental exploration                          GshB a different story          A set of GshBs was assembled by searching the NCBI          protein database using either GshB or glutathione          synthetase as query words and from the outputs of BLAST          searches with the           E coli and           S cerevisiae proteins as query          sequences The sequences in the GshB set fall into two          distinct groups corresponding to bacteria and          eukaryotes that have no significant relationship to each          other on the basis of pairwise sequence identities As          seen with GshA PSIBLAST searches with GshB sequences          from either group did not find GshB sequences from the          other group A PSIBLAST search with the human GshB          converged after two iterations The output contained only          eukaryotic GshBs a few putative homoglutathione          synthestases and a few eukaryotic proteins of unknown          function No bacterial GshBs were found in the output          After multiple iterations a PSIBLAST search using the           E coli GshB gi as an          initial query sequence found  sequences of enzymes in          the ATPgrasp superfamily to which the bacterial enzyme          is known to belong but no eukaryotic GshB sequences The          ATPgrasp superfamily   includes at least  families          of enzymes that catalyze formation of a bond between a          carboxylate group of one substrate and an amino imino or          thiol group of a second substrate The bacterial GshBs          are most closely related to ribosomal S modification          enzymes which catalyze the addition of glutamate to the          carboxyl terminus of ribosomal protein S Other members          of the superfamily include carbamoyl phosphate synthases          cyanophycin synthetases and DAlaDAla ligases Notably          many members of the ATPgrasp superfamily were found in          eukaryotes For example           A thaliana has at least three          superfamily members in the PSIBLAST output including          carbamoyl phosphate synthetase methylcrotonylCoA          carboxylase and acetyl CoA carboxylase However the           Arabidopsis GshB is not found in          the output Thus ATPgrasp superfamily members in          eukaryotes are more closely related to bacterial GshBs          than to eukaryotic GshBs          Crystal structures of GshBs from           E coli   and human   are          available so we are able to consider the evolutionary          relationship between the two groups of sequences in the          context of the structural information Figure  The           E coli and human enzymes have the          same overall structural fold which is typical of the          ATPgrasp superfamily   The human enzyme has a          number of insertions and in addition has a circular          permutation of the sequence that results in the movement          of part of the carboxyterminal domain to the          aminoterminal domain The sequence identity between the           E coli and human enzymes is          strikingly low Even in the regions that can be          structurally superimposed it is only  Furthermore          only  out of  residues involved in binding GSH are          conserved between the two enzymes            The structural similarity between the           E coli and human GshBs indicates          that the bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes could be          related to each other but is not sufficient to prove          that they are related to each other because the common          structure might have arisen by convergent evolution from          different progenitors This consideration is especially          worth noting in light of the very low conservation of          residues in the active site Consequently we looked for          evidence of an evolutionary relationship by attempting to          find proteins that might be distantly related to the          bacterial and eukaryotic GshB proteins and therefore          might bridge the sequence gap between them using the          Shotgun algorithm   which was designed to facilitate          searches for distant relations between proteins The          algorithm performs a BLAST search with each of a set of          query sequences It then sorts the hits found by all of          the proteins and for each hit identifies the query          sequences that found that hit A hit that is found by          multiple members of two distinct groups of proteins even          with low BLAST scores can be examined closely to          determine whether it provides a link between the          groups          We ran Shotgun with a query set containing six          eukaryotic GshBs eight bacterial GshBs eight S          modification enzymes four from bacteria and four from          archaea and four proteins of unknown function three          from bacteria and one from the archaeon           Methanococcus jannaschii  Sample          outputs are shown in Figure  Generally sequences were          found by either bacterial GshBs and the S modification          enzymes or by eukaryotic GshB proteins but not by both          groups There was only one exception which was a protein          a putative GshB from           Medicago truncatula gi           found by all six of the eukaryotic GshBs with BLAST          scores above  BLAST probabilities less than e          and one bacterial GshB with a BLAST score of  BLAST          probability of  Given the number of bacterial GshB          sequences in the query set the finding of one bacterial          sequence with an insignificant           p value can be regarded as a          chance occurrence Thus we were unable to establish any          relationship between the two groups of GshB sequences          using Shotgun          Demonstration of conserved sequence motifs would          provide supporting evidence for an evolutionary          relationship between eukaryotic and bacterial GshBs In          this case the Block Maker algorithm used to analyze the          GshA proteins did not perform well This algorithm begins          by constructing a ClustalW   multiple sequence          alignment The circular permutation of the eukaryotic          sequences with respect to the bacterial sequences as          well as the extremely low sequence identities make          alignment difficult and preclude the identification of          blocks in the permuted region Therefore a different          motiffinding algorithm MEME     was used to          analyze a divergent set of GshBs along with several of          the proteins related to the bacterial GshBs Twelve          strongly conserved motifs were identified Table  The          pattern of distribution of these motifs in eukaryotic          GshBs bacterial GshBs and S modification enzymes the          enzymes most closely related to the bacterial GshBs is          illustrated in Figure  Motifs  and  are peculiar to          the bacterial GshB proteins and map to the          substratebinding region of the protein These motifs are          replaced by others in the S modification enzymes and in          DAlaDAla ligases data not shown while the motifs          involved in the ATPbinding site    and  are          conserved This protein scaffold clearly provides a          modular structure that is easily adapted to bind          different substrates in proximity to bound ATP Two          motifs  and  that contribute to the ATPbinding          pocket were found in both eukaryotic and bacterial GshBs          as well as other members of the ATPgrasp superfamily          These motifs were present in different orders in the          bacterial and eukaryotic GshBs see Figure  because          motif  is involved in the circular permutation that          moves part of the carboxyterminal domain to the          aminoterminal domain of the eukaryotic enzymes The lack          of conserved motifs in the substratebinding region is          consistent with the comparison of the           E coli and human GshB structures          which shows remarkably little similarity in this region          of the protein          In a case such as this one it can be difficult to          determine whether common sequence motifs have arisen by          divergence from a common progenitor or by convergent          evolution driven by a common function The two common          motifs found in the bacterial and eukaryotic GshBs          correspond to the ATPbinding pocket Thus we examined          the possibility that motifs  and  arose by convergent          evolution driven by the need to bind ATP by looking for          these motifs in other proteins that bind ATP We searched          the nonredundant database with motifs  and  using the          MAST algorithm Searches with motif  and  retrieved           and  sequences with           E values less than           respectively Nearly all of the proteins with known          functions in the output were GshBs or other members of          the ATPgrasp superfamily All of the  proteins found          by motif  were members of the ATPgrasp superfamily          except for two transcriptional regulators with           E values of  gi and           gi dihydroorotate dehydrogenases with           E values greater than  from          several organisms and a prolinebetaine transporter          gi with an           E value of  All of the          proteins with known functions found by motif  were          members of the ATPgrasp superfamily except the          LIMcontaining protein kinase t gi which had          an           E value of  Thus motifs  and           are characteristic of the ATPbinding region of the          ATPgrasp superfamily enzymes          The question of whether eukaryotic GshBs are members          of the ATPgrasp superfamily is difficult to answer with          certainty because the eukaryotic GshBs are so          dramatically different from the other superfamily          members The two conserved sequence motifs involved in          ATP binding do provide a link between eukaryotic GshBs          and the ATPgrasp superfamily but it is rather tenuous          as it is possible that these sequences provide the best          way to bind ATP within the context of this structural          fold and have evolved by convergent evolution in          eukaryotic GshBs and the ATPgrasp superfamily members          The lack of conservation in the glutathionebinding          region of bacterial and eukaryotic GshBs is also an          important consideration We feel that the evidence for a          true evolutionary relationship between the eukaryotic          GshBs and the ATPgrasp superfamily is rather weak given          the evidence available at this time For our purposes          here it is sufficient to conclude in agreement with          Polekhina           et al   that eukaryotic GshBs          did not evolve directly from bacterial GshBs but rather          that both evolved from ancestors that had the          characteristic fold of the ATPgrasp superfamily                          A different twist A fused GSHAATPgrasp          superfamily homolog in an odd collection of          bacteria          In most organisms GshA and GshB are encoded by          separate genes that are not in close proximity An          interesting variation on this theme may occur in a small          number of bacteria           Clostridium perfringens Listeria          monocytogenes Listeria innocuans and           Pasteurella multocidans have an          open reading frame ORF that could encode a GshA homolog          fused to an ATPgrasp superfamily member raising the          possibility that this protein might combine the two          activities required for synthesis of GSH           C perfringens and           L monocytogenes contain low levels          of GSH  molg residual dry weight that are about          fold lower than those found in           E coli but it is not known          whether they synthesize GSH or simply import it from the          medium   Experimental determination of the function          of these fused proteins is clearly needed          The aminoterminal part of the fusion proteins is most          closely related to group  GshAs although the sequence          identities are not high Table  The carboxyterminal          parts of these proteins are most closely related to          cyanophycin synthetase which catalyzes the synthesis of          a polypeptide storage polymer in cyanobacteria and more          distantly related to DAlaDAla ligase which is          involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis in many bacteria          These enzymes are members of the ATPgrasp superfamily          to which GshB also belongs However there is no          significant relationship between the carboxyterminal          region of these putative fusion proteins and known GshBs          see Table  If this part of the protein does indeed          function as a glutathione synthetase then this would be          another example of independent recruitment of an          ATPgrasp superfamily member to provide this          function          The occurrence of an ORF for the fusion protein in          this cluster of bacteria is curious because           C perfringens L          monocytogenes and           L innocuans are lowGC          Grampositive bacteria while           P multocida is a          gammaproteobacterium           C perfringens is found in soil and          sewage and is often part of the normal intestinal flora          of animals and humans It causes gangrene and food          poisoning in humans             L monocytogenes and           L innocuans are ubiquitous          contaminants of soil and water and           L monocytogenes causes          listeriosis a serious foodborne illness             P multocida colonizes the          nasopharynx and gastrointestinal tract of many animals          and birds and causes a wide range of illnesses            Human infections are most often caused by dog or cat          bites Thus the association of these bacteria with          animals as either commensal or pathogenic organisms has          apparently provided an opportunity for lateral transfer          of the gene encoding the fusion protein          The ORF for the putative fusion protein in           P multocida is particularly          intriguing because gammaproteobacteria typically have a          group  GshA and a typical bacterial GshB           P multocida has neither of these          and neither does its close relative           Haemophilus influenzae The lineage          leading to           P multocida and           H influenzae diverged from other          gammaproteobacteria approximately  million years ago                      P multocida and           H influenzae have considerably          smaller genomes  and  predicted coding          regions respectively    than           E coli  predicted coding          regions   suggesting that this lineage has          undergone substantial genome reduction It is possible          that the lineage leading to           P multocida and           H influenzae lost GshA and           P multocida subsequently acquired          the fused GshAATPgrasp superfamily homolog in its          place                          Putting together the pieces thoughts on the          evolution of the pathway          The pathway for GSH biosynthesis involves two enzymes          and it is of interest to consider which of these evolved          first Horowitz has postulated that biosynthetic pathways          evolve in a retrograde fashion beginning with the last          enzyme in the pathway   This hypothesis rests on the          assumption that organisms had at one time access to a          supply of precursors for biological polymers such as DNA          RNA proteins and polysaccharides As the supply of a          given precursor dwindled the most successful organisms          would be those that invented an enzyme with which to          catalyze formation of that precursor from compounds          present in the environment Thus there would be          continuous selective pressure to add enzymes in the          retrograde direction to catalyze synthesis of precursors          from ever more simple constituents Evolution of a          biosynthetic pathway in the forward direction was deemed          unlikely as there would be no selective pressure for          evolution of enzymes to produce intermediates of no          further use to the organism Horowitzs proposal is          logical and appealing There are cases however in which          forward evolution of a pathway seems more likely For          example many organisms make complex natural products          whose roles generally involve killing or manipulating          other organisms The pathways for building these complex          structures have probably evolved in a forward direction          by addition of enzymes capable of adding to the          complexity of a preexisting molecule and thereby          contributing to its biological potency          The GSH biosynthesis pathway is most likely to have          evolved in a forward direction If the pathway had          evolved in a retrograde direction the Horowitz theory          would postulate that GshB arose to take advantage of          GluCys present in the environment It is unlikely that          GluCys would have been available because formation of          the highenergy amide bond would be unlikely to occur          abiotically Furthermore this molecule would be unstable          to oxidation in aerobic environments However evolution          of the GSH biosynthesis pathway in the forward direction          makes considerable sense GluCys can serve some of the          functions of GSH and therefore could be advantageous to          an organism even in the absence of GshB Indeed          halobacteria contain millimolar levels of GluCys but          do not convert it further to GSH   However GluCys          is not an ideal solution as it is more easily oxidized          than GSH   Furthermore the reactivity of a thiol          depends upon its pKa as thiolates are orders of          magnitude more nucleophilic than thiols   The          nucleophilicity of the thiol in GluCys should be          diminished by the proximity of the negatively charged          carboxylate Further reaction of GluCys with Gly to          form GSH would improve its properties with respect to          both oxidation and nucleophilicity thus providing          selective pressure for evolution of a GSH synthetase          GshB          One possible source for an enzyme to catalyze the next          step in a pathway evolving in the forward direction is          the enzyme that catalyzed the last step as this enzyme          has a binding site that accommodates the product of the          last reaction and that product is the substrate for the          next reaction A similar situation occurs for pathways          evolving in a retrograde direction This type of enzyme          recruitment which takes advantage of already existing          substratespecificity determinants but requires changes          in catalytic groups appears to occur rather infrequently            For example among  proteins involved in the          smallmolecule metabolic pathways in           E coli homology between          consecutive enzymes in a pathway occurs only six times            Most often enzymes are recruited to catalyze new          reactions by virtue of the catalytic abilities of their          active sites and interactions required for substrate          binding are then optimized The GSH biosynthesis genes          however appear to be an optimal case for recruitment of          one enzyme to catalyze a subsequent reaction As GshA has          a binding site that accommodates GluCys it would          appear to be an ideal progenitor of GshB which uses          GluCys as a substrate and also catalyzes the          ATPdependent formation of an amide bond However GshA          and GshB appear to be structurally distinct There are no          experimental structures for GshAs but recent work          suggests that GshAs are homologs of glutamine synthetases            GshBs have a different structural fold          characteristic of the ATPgrasp superfamily Thus the          data support a scenario in which emergence of GshA was          followed in most organisms by the recruitment of a          different protein to serve as the progenitor of GshB It          is particularly interesting that in both the bacterial          and eukaryotic lineages the ATPgrasp structural fold          provided the starting point for the evolution of          GshB                            Conclusions        Our analysis of the sequences of GshAs and GshBs        suggests that the evolutionary history of these proteins is        more complex than expected on the basis of the distribution        of GSH in extant organisms Our results as well as the        observation that GshA and GshB genes are generally not        found in proximity in microbial genomes suggest that these        genes did not evolve together Therefore we must consider        the evolutionary history of the two genes separately        Although the origin of the GshA gene cannot be        unequivocally determined it is most plausible to suppose        that it arose in cyanobacteria which would have been the        first cells to require the protection conferred by        GluCys against reactive oxygen species If this        hypothesis is correct then subsequent lateral gene        transfers must have occurred to spread the gene to the        proteobacteria and eukaryotes as well as to at least one        archaeon and possibly to some Grampositive bacteria        Because of the high level of sequence divergence there is        no clear indication in the sequence data as to whether        eukaryotes acquired a GshA gene from a cyanobacterium or a        proteobacterium After the acquisition of GshA a further        improvement in protection against reactive oxygen species        was obtained in most organisms by recruitment of an enzyme        to convert GluCys to GSH This recruitment apparently        took place independently in the bacterial and eukaryotic        lineages since the sequence of the eukaryotic GshB is        remarkably different from that of the bacterial GshBs        despite the structural similarities between these two        proteins At least for GshB therefore we can eliminate        the possibility of transfer from the mitochondrial        progenitor into an early eukaryote The emerging picture of        the evolution of the glutathione biosynthesis pathway is        significant because it suggests that the pathway evolved in        a forward direction in contradiction to the Horowitz        hypothesis                    Materials and methods        BLAST   and PSIBLAST   searches were carried        out
