peace processes outlined in the Wye River accord signed lastfall The agreement requires the withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of theWest Bank and calls on both sides to refrain from taking unilateral actionwhich ensures the Palestinians wont declare statehood and the Israelis wontbuild settlements in the West Bank or Gaza Strip It also lays out an ambitiousplan to achieve permanent settlement between the two sides in one year            All three papers praise Madeleine Albrights shuttle diplomacy Albright isgiven credit for salvaging the agreement which hit a snag on Thursday afterIsrael refused to release an extra  prisoners as part of the deal Uncowed bythe posturing and brinkmanship attributed to both sides Albright quicklyswitched gears from passive envoy to diplomacy maven The WP explainsthat Albright heeding an Israeli request that the US play a backseat rolein the negotiations had been reluctant to interfere but plunged into the fraywith decisive mediation Meanwhile the NYT reports that Albrightpositioned in front of a painting of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem seemedanxious to stress that her role was minimal insisting she was neither amediator nor a facilitator but a handmaiden her word The NYT notesthat Albrights starring role has given her a muchneeded boost as she travelsto Syria to try to jumpstart negotiations between that country and
