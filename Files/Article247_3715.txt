                                 New Patriotic Challenger            SIMI VALLEY CalifOn the plane from Washington to abreakfast speech in Grand Rapids Mich this morning John McCain got a briefbriefing on local conditions John Weaver his national political directoralerted him that the audience waiting inside the aircraft hangar might includeBetsy DeVos the chairman of the state party who happens to be married to thehead of the Amway Corp and who also happens to be a committed foe of campaignfinance reform Then Ill just have to emphasize campaign finance reformMcCain replied grinning mischievously He then recalled a previous meetingwhen he brought his signature issue up in Michigan doing an impression ofDeVos reaction in a small meeting McCain clenched his teeth screwed up hisface and snarled GRRRRRRR            McCain didnt spot Ms DeVos at the breakfast but hedwelt on campaign finance reform anyhowhe always does Running on this issueas a Republican may be the most contrarian notion in his delightfullycontrarian campaign Its not clear that many voters outside of reformmindedstates like Minnesota have ever made up their minds about whom to vote for onthe basis of this issue What is certainor at least was until hiscampaignis that Republicans who continue to enjoy a substantial advantage inraising money under the current system see little appeal in McCains ideasabout how to reform it            McCain thinks he can elevate the issueand hispresidential candidacyby broadening the issue beyond its numbingtechnicalities He hopes to link it to the apathy young people feel aboutpolitics and to a larger sense of national purpose McCain thinks the fact thatspecial interest money dominates the electoral system is a big part of thereason that a majority of toyearolds dont register and dont vote Hesees political corruption not just as an Augean stable to be cleansed but as apositive issue that can serve to reengage the disaffected electorateRestoring honesty to our political system is the gateway through which allother political reforms must pass he said here in a speech at the ReaganLibrary to sustained applause and a loud cry of Amen from a man in a skirtand sneakers who later identified himself as the leader of EvangelicalChristian Democrats for McCain            The historical role model cited by George W Bushsadviser Karl Rove is Mark Hanna Hanna elected William McKinley president in by marshalling the wealth of the robber barons on his behalf The exemplarfor McCain is Teddy Roosevelt the reformer who became president after McKinleywas assassinated in  When asked by a highschool student in Grand Rapidswho he thought of as the greatest American living or dead McCain who wasstopping in Michigan en route to the Reagan Library cited Reagan as his livingexample and TR along with Lincoln as the dead one            McCain mentions Teddy Roosevelt frequently He told meon the planea plush Citation borrowed from Rupert Murdochthat he has beenreading TRs speeches and finding them relevant to his campaign in a number ofways One way is as a guide to political reform Teddy Roosevelt he saysunderstood that in reform the perfect was the enemy of the good McCain whorecently agreed to drop everything but a ban on soft money from his eponymouscampaign reform bill which is supposed to come up for another Senate votesoon agrees He says that after a decade shrewd operators will find theloopholes in any finance reform bill Cleaning up the system thus has to be aperiodic and inevitably incomplete process He hopes that McCainFeingoldwill reduce the power of special interest money in politics not eliminate itbecause eliminating it is impossible He has focused on soft moneyunregulatedlarge contributions to the partiesbecause he thinks that they are the singlebiggest problem just as corporate contributions were when Roosevelt got thembanned in             McCain sees other points of commonality with TR aswell He frequently points out Roosevelts status as the Republican father ofconservationa topic he plans to emphasize at an appearance in Seattletomorrow morning This should be a fruitful theme for McCain because there isreally no other claimant to Roosevelts environmental legacy in the GOP ThoughGeorge W Bush fits the moderate Republican profile in other respects Bushsantiregulatory probusiness views steer him clear of the Sierra Club            The most important link to Teddy Roosevelt howeverisnt any single issue Its the way McCain aspires to draw political reformenvironmentalism an internationalist foreign policy and more together in acall for renewed civic engagement Roosevelts vision was summed up in thephrase The New Nationalism McCains somewhat ungainly slogan The NewPatriotic Challenge owes a debt to this Sometimes McCain defines hispatriotic challenge in terms of political reform as he did here at the ReaganLibrary where he called it a fight against the pervasive cynicism that isdebilitating our democracy that cheapens our public debates that threatensour public institutions our culture and ultimately our private happinessOther times he casts it as an ask not call to public service In GrandRapids McCain says he wrote his new book in the hope that young people mightpick it up and read it and realize the great virtue in committing themselves toAmericas cause In his view this includes all kinds of public service Itdoesnt have to be military he says It can be in a mental hospital or theNational Forest Service or the Peace Corps                         McCain has not yet managed to communicate his charismain public or to the young in anything like the way John F Kennedy once didBut his new patriotic challenge seems to strike a chord nonetheless WhenMcCain calls upon the rest of us to serve he asks from a position of uttercredibility based on what he sacrificed in serving This is something that isnot true for any of the other candidates
