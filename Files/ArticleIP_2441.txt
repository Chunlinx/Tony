                                 Selling Seals of Approval            Walk into anyhomeimprovement megastore find their wall o carbonmonoxide detectors andyoull notice that only one product carries the American Lung Association sealon its boxAmerican Sensors Does this mean American Sensors CO detectors arethe best Better than those made by First Alert Nighthawk or others Notexactly American Sensors ranked fourth in tests conducted by ConsumerReports last year Three of its models were deemed not acceptable by themagazine thanks to a design flawsince fixedthat could have shortcircuitedthe device            What the seal really tellsyou is that charities have found a new way to fatten their budgetsbyexclusive contracts with private companies The American Cancer Societyrecently sold its logo to the Florida Department of Citrus for  million ayear It gets another million annually from SmithKline Beecham which puts theACS logo on its Nicodermbrand nicotine patches Not to be outdone the makersof Nicotrol a competing patch product recently inked a twoyear deal with theALA for  million            The dealsare exclusive but theyre not endorsements The charities dont test theproducts or ensure that the highestquality ones get their logos            Charities say they need the money Competition fromthousands of other nonprofits makes fund raising difficult The ACS says itssurveys show that the public supports such contracts so long as they raiseplenty of money for the charity and dont conflict with its basic mission            Butgetting in bed with corporate America carries sizable risks Charities sellingtheir halosas some have put itrisk damaging their reputations as sourcesof independent information And in some cases they seem to be skating close tothe edge of propriety if not the law            Take for example the sticky problem of thecharities benefiting from what appears to be false advertising Companieswouldnt pony up the bucks for a charitys logo if they didnt think it gavethem a competitive edge Why would they think that it would Because at leastsome consumers are going to be misled into thinking this is a special thing Ithink its flatout misleading says Robert Lawry director of the Center forProfessional Ethics at Case Western Reserve University            Two deals have alreadyfallen through because government officials concluded the same thing            The American HeartAssociation dropped its HeartGuide Seal program in  after federalregulatory agencies complained it would mislead consumers The program startedin  endorsed in exchange for a sizable fee food products that metcertain standards The US Department of Agriculture refused to let the AHAput its seal on any products it regulated            Lastyear McNeil Consumer Products agreed to pay nearly  million to settle acomplaint filed by  state attorneys general with regard to its ArthritisFoundationbrand aspirin Ads for the pills claimed the drugs were somehownewalthough they were just plain old aspirin The ads said the ArthritisFoundation helped create the pills though it didnt McNeil dropped theproduct after the attorneys general complained even though a company spokesmansays it exited the business because it wasnt achieving its goals McNeil headded still donates more than  million annually to the AF            Companies admit that the logos help sales thanks to theappearance of an endorsement where none exists It definitely helps us sellour products says Peter Paris a spokesman for SmithKline Beecham maker ofNicoderm because it provides the consumer with a more credible resourcebehind this particular product Well not behind it per se The charitiesParis adds dont endorse the product at all            AmericanSensors has seen its detector sales skyrocket from under  million in  towell over  million today Did the ALA logo help I certainly think ithelped sales of our detectors says Mike Lupynec the companys president andCEO            So how do the charities respond They say theytry to make clear on the label that it reflects a partnership not a productendorsement But they admit that at least some consumers are being misled bythe logo            Is there an impliedendorsement The answer to that has to be yes There is no way around itsaid American Cancer Society Vice President Steve Dickinson            Thats agray area says John Kirkwood who is with the ALA of Metropolitan ChicagoIf youre standing there looking at the shelf you might say Hmm maybe Illbuy the product with the logo as opposed to the one that doesnt have anyThats a reality Kirkwood was instrumental in putting the ALAAmericanSensors deal together He later served on American Sensors board but insiststhere was no quid pro quo            Another land mine Can charities that cut lucrative dealswith product makers be counted on to provide accurate information about healthand safety issues related to those products Heightened fear about COpoisonings in the home might help sell detectors but only  people a yeardie this way according to the National Safety Council Nearly five times asmany die of suffocation each year at home And CO deaths were falling steadilylong before home detectors hit the market Is the ALA going to tell you aboutthat Nicotine patches work only about  percent of the time True they oftenhelp hardcore smokers quit when other systems have failed But the mosteffective way to quit is to save your money and go cold turkey Are the healthcharities going to advertise this fact            Getting too cozy withcorporate interests carries other risks as well            TheAmerican Lung Association for instance has been attacked in the past for atleast giving the appearance of lobbying on behalf of corporate interests thathave opened their checkbooks            Back in  the ALA and some of its stateaffiliates started bashing the cementkiln industry which was trying to getpermits to burn toxic waste The ALA complained that the practice was hazardousto peoples health Fair enough But it happens that at the same time thecharity was getting grants totaling more than  from the Association forResponsible Thermal Treatment which represented the kiln industrys directcompetitor in the wasteincineration business            Whenofficials from the Cement Kiln Recycling Coalition asked about this at ameeting ALA officials said that state chapters which are relativelyautonomous ran the campaigns But one ALA official added that the charitywould be happy to take money from the kiln industry too provided the grantscame with no strings attached In January  the kiln industry filed acomplaint with the Internal Revenue Service charging that the ALA was beingpaid to lobby on behalf of a commercial interest a violation of its nonprofittax status            And in late  the national ALA took out an ad in thePittsburgh PostGazette promoting a centralized autoemissions testprogram called ECheckwhich used testing equipment made by ArizonabasedEnvirotest Systems Corpover another kind of testing regime Theadvertisement generated a flood of phone calls to the ALAs WesternPennsylvania chapter from outraged donors said the state chapters executivedirector            It turns out that Envirotesthad also been a generous donor to the national ALA giving a total of more than to the charity between  and  according to tax filings            Given these risks why pursuethese relationships Some charities plead poverty Youve got something like new nonprofits in the past  years says the ALAs Kirkwood Andtheyre all competing for the same dollar But budgets for the big charitieshave seen healthy gains in recent years The ALAs national office saw itstotal revenues climb almost  percent in the four years before it signed itsdeal with American Sensors according to the charitys tax filings AmericanCancer Society revenues have climbed almost  percent so far in thisdecade            More likely its reluctanceon the part of companies to part with money without seeing any direct benefitNonprofits cant count on corporations to give millions of dollars justbecause they want to be good citizens says Paris who once worked at the ALANow everything has to be linked to a stronger benefit
