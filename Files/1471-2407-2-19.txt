                    Background        Despite continuing decreases in incidence and mortality        rates cancers of the colon and rectum remain the third        leading cause of cancer deaths in the North America             The decline in incidence and hence mortality from        colorectal cancers is most likely attributable to an        increase in recommendations to perform routine screening on        average risk individuals and to improved screening        techniques     In addition there is ever advancing        knowledge into the pathogenic mechanism of cancer and        resulting strides in the development of more efficacious        therapies        In recent years it has become evident that nonsteroidal        antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs represent a potential        class of cancer chemotherapeutic agents The utility of        NSAIDs in particular aspirin in the treatment of colon        cancer has stemmed from studies conducted both in animals                   and humans        Evidence        from human studies has largely come from epidemiological        data indicating that aspirin and other NSAIDs can reduce        the relative risk of developing colorectal cancer by        approximately         The utility of        NSAIDs in the cancer therapeutics is not limited to        prevention strategies The NSAID sulindac has been shown to        cause regression of colorectal adenomas of patients with        hereditary forms of polyposis Familial Adenomatous        Polyposis FAP and Gardners Syndrome      and in        sporadic colorectal adenomas     In addition case        reports have demonstrated that indomethacin and sulindac        were effective cotherapy agents in the treatment of        desmoid tumours      Finally the inclusion either        of indomethacin naproxen or sulindac in the chemotherapy        regiment of gastric carcinoma patients resulted in a        significant increase in survival  months versus  months        when NSAIDs included in treatment regime            The antineoplastic properties of NSAIDs can be        duplicated in animal models mainly rodent of colon        cancer The two most commonly used are the multiple        intestinal neoplasia          Min  mouse and the chemically        azoxymethaneinduced rat models In both models NSAID        administration has been reported to significantly attenuate        tumour number and size when provided either as a preventive                   or treatment      agent The         Min  model has received great        favour because it contains a mutation in the         Apc gene which is homologous to the        human adenomatous polyposis coli APC gene            Defects in the APC tumour suppressor gene are thought to        play a role in greater than  of all colorectal cancers        and is responsible for inherited syndromes of polyposis        FAP and Gardners      Furthermore in humans the        majority of colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous        polyps            Polyposis in the         Min  mouse differs slightly from        the human condition of FAP Polyps multiple are generally        localized to the small intestine in         Min  mice opposed to the colons of        FAP suffers     In         Min  mice adenoma formation is        thought to occur within the first few weeks of life with a        full compliment of adenomas being attained by approximately         weeks of age  days of age      Following        this time adenoma multiplicity is thought not to change        however adenoma size may still increase              Min  mice are also normally found        to develop anaemia by  days of age and possess a        shortened life span of roughly  days  weeks                   Aspirin most likely represents the best known and        frequently purchased NSAID     It is also the NSAID        normally cited in epidemiological studies assessing the        chemopreventive efficacy of NSAIDs     but yet the        utility of aspirin in the treatment of         established colorectal cancer has not        been determined We therefore wanted to determine if        aspirin is able to reduce the number and size of adenomas        in         Min  mice with         established polyposis                    Materials and methods                  Animals                    Min  CBLJ

began at  weeks  days of age and          concluded at  weeks  days of age Following          completion of the treatment period mice were euthanized          with sodium pentobarbital Nembutal   mgkg

   present were located in the small intestine table           Once daily oral administration of aspirin  mgkg for          four weeks had no effect on the number of polyps in the          intestinal tract of           Min  mice Aspirintreated mice          contained    small intestinal polyps and             large intestinal polyps table  Concurrent with the          above findings no significant differences were seen in          total adenoma area or average adenoma size Adenomas in          the small intestine had an average diameter of             mm and    mm for vehicle and          aspirintreated           Min  mice respectively Similar          findings were seen within large intestine table           Furthermore no changes were seen in the distribution of          adenomas when classified according to diameter figure           Small intestinal adenomas were less than  mm in          diameter with the approximately  being  mm in          diameter Large intestinal adenomas as large as  mm in          diameter were occasionally seen Aspirin treatment had no          effect on adenoma size distribution and both profiles          were essentially identical to

levels of                  Survival rate of the           Min  mice was greater than           One animal had to be sacrificed prior  days to the          completion of the study and was in the vehicle treatment          group table  Postmortem examination revealed a total          of  polyps  small and  large intestinal Data          obtained from this animal was not included in the          analysis In addition one animal was found to possess no          small or large intestinal polyps The animal had been          treated with a full regiment of aspirin however it was          assumed not to possess the           Min  genotype and was therefore          not included in data analysis A wild type genotype was          assumed since no existing data suggests or indicates          that aspirin is able to cause complete elimination of          adenomas in this model The animal also possessed a          normal hematocrit value of                                 Discussion        The American Cancer Society has indicated that cancer        incidence rates are on the decline however they estimate        that greater than  million new cases will be diagnosed        this year     Of these new cases it is expected that        colorectal cancers will comprise approximately             With staggering numbers as these it is not surprising        that chemoprevention has been proposed as a viable strategy        to fight cancer Among the leading therapeutic agents in        colorectal cancer prevention are NSAIDs especially        aspirin Epidemiological studies have indicated that the        frequent long term use of aspirin could reduce the        relative risk of developing colorectal cancer by                Despite the wealth of information regarding        the chemopreventive ability of aspirin information to        indicate aspirins utility in a therapeutic modality is        lacking To date no studies or case reports have examined        the use of aspirin in the treatment of FAP although        various clinical trials are under way     In        accordance with the above data studies conducted in        animals have always employed a prevention strategy as well              To our knowledge this is the first study to        examine the therapeutic potential of aspirin in a rodent        model of colon carcinogenesis in particular the         Min  murine model of polyposis The        study revealed that treatment of         Min  mice with established        polyposis with aspirin for  weeks produce no appreciable        therapeutic effect        While the evaluation of aspirin in the         Min  model utilising a therapeutic        regime is lacking other NSAIDs sulindac flurbiprofen        piroxicam and celecoxib have been shown to significantly        reduce polyp numbers when administered using similar        protocols        In addition three recent        reports have demonstrated a lack of effect of aspirin as a        chemopreventive agent in         Min  mice       Combined        these studies indicate that the         Min  model is responsive to NSAIDs        other than aspirin when provided as a treatment They also        raise into question the efficacy of aspirin as a        chemotherapeutic for colon cancer and perhaps more        specifically familial adenomatous polyposis        With the exemplary track record of NSAIDs in this model        of colon cancer why was a lack of effect seen in this        model Was it a consequence of the dose of aspirin andor        duration of treatment used In the current study mice        received approximately  g of aspirin per day This        amount of aspirin was found by Mahmoud         et al    to be sufficient        significant to reduce both polyp number and intestinal        prostaglandin PGE           content by greater than  when        provided from  weeks of age to  weeks of age ie        chemopreventive regime Barnes and Lee    have also        suggested that the maximal tumour suppression for aspirin        may be in the  range The above authors followed a        similar protocol to Mahmoud et al     but employed far        greater doses of aspirin  and  mgkgday and reported        no doseresponse relationship and a maximal suppression of             Furthermore in the rat model of        azoxymethaneinduced colon carcinogenesis aspirin has also        only been found to inhibit aberrant crypt foci and tumour        development by no more than       Coincidentally        epidemiological data also report reductions in the         range        However whether this can be used        as an argument to support the notion that aspirin is only        able to suppress tumour formation by  is difficult to        extrapolate because two different end points are being        examined ie relative risk versus tumour number        Finally as indicated earlier other studies have        demonstrated that doses of NSAIDs other than aspirin which        were found to be chemopreventive were able to produce        similar reductions in polyp numbers when used in a        treatment regime        Chiu         et al    demonstrated that         Min  mice at approximately  weeks        of age possessed roughly  polyps and that treatment        starting at  weeks of age for as little as  days with        sulindac produced a  reduction in polyp number        Similarly Ritland and Gendler    reported that        administration of piroxicam  ppm in diet to  week        old         Min  mice for  or more days        resulted in maximal tumour number suppression         Finally         R flurbiprofen  mgkgday orally        administered to         Min  for  days starting at         weeks of age was also able to decrease tumour number by        greater than             Various studies have reported increased levels of        prostaglandins and COX expression in colorectal adenomas        and adenocarcinomas obtained both from animals            and humans       These findings have lead to the        implication that COX plays an important role in        intestinal neoplasia and that the antineoplastic effects        of NSAIDs are attributable to their ability to inhibit        COX In light of this information the mechanism by which        aspirin and other NSAIDs inhibit colorectal cancer        progression has not been fully elucidated and cannot simply        be equated to the suppression of COX activity Shiff and        Rigas    indicate that NSAIDs may to affect colorectal        cancer development via one or more of the following four        areas  COXmediated carcinogen activation  cell        proliferation  apoptosis and  immune surveillance        Within these potential mechanisms exists the possibility        for both COXdependent and independent mechanisms In the        current study we also examined COXactivity and apoptosis        The treatment regime employed was sufficient to attenuate        COX activity by  and increased the number of apoptotic        bodies within tumours by greater than fold Similar        findings were reported by Mahmoud         et al     using an equivalent        dose of aspirin in a prevention strategy These authors        demonstrated a  reduction in small intestinal tumour        number and PGE          content and a fold increase in        apoptosis Contrary to the similarities seen in        COXinhibition and increased apoptosis the present study        saw no effect on tumour number or size The discordant        effect seen between the current study and that of Mahmoud         et al     are difficult to        explain The duration and timing of treatment ie        prevention vs treatment would seem the most likely        explanation This possibility has also been eluded in        epidemiological studies The Physicians Health Study found        no significant reduction in the relative risk of developing        colorectal cancer in individuals consuming  mg of        aspirin every other day for  years     The Nurses        Health Study reported that a significant decrease in risk        was only seen in women who took aspirin on a regular basis        for  or more years     Whether this simple        explanation accounts for the difference in results reported        here and by Mahmoud         et al     does not seem likely        As stated earlier three previous studies employing        prevention strategies and higher doses of aspirin also        found no effect on tumour burden       Perhaps a        similar discordant effect will appear in human studies as        results are released from the currently ongoing clinical        trials     If such a situation does arise it could        indicate that aspirin might not be the NSAID of choice for        colorectal cancer therapy In contrast to date no        conflicting data have been published regarding the use of        sulindac Sulindac has been shown to be efficacious both in        rodent models of FAP and in human FAP patients        Although no change was seen in tumour number or size        the significant increase seen in apoptosis might imply that        aspirin could still hold utility in treating colorectal        cancer The present study would suggest that aspirin has        little or no use as a standalone therapy but could        present a viable option in combination chemotherapy Recent        reports by Torrance         et al    and Mann         et al    demonstrate that        combinatorial therapy comprised of a COX inhibitor and        growth factor receptor inhibitors resulted in synergistic        antitumour activity In fact the study conducted by        Torrance and colleagues    demonstrated that doses of        sulindac  mgkg found to be ineffective as standalone        chemotherapy in the Min model became extremely potent        when combined with an epidermal growth factor receptor        kinase inhibitor The combination therapy was able to        completely abolish all macroscopically visible tumours in         of the animals treated     This could prove to be        very advantageous since it may allow for lower doses of        NSAIDs to be used thereby limiting the adverse effects        associated with long term NSAID use Pursuing future        research into the combinatorial        chemopreventivechemotherapeutic potential of aspirin may        be of greater value than trying to account for the        discordant effect                    Conclusions        Despite abundant evidence from epidemiological clinical        and animal studies regarding the potential utility of        aspirin as a chemotherapeutic agent for colorectal cancer        the current study found no change in tumour burden in the        extensively used         Min  murine model of colon cancer        The findings that aspirin was still able to significantly        increase the number of apoptotic cells within tumours and        lower prostaglandin levels suggests that it may be better        suited to combinatorial therapy but its utility as a        standalone modality in established GI cancer is        questionable Promising results have already been attained        in animal models using COX inhibitors as cotherapies in        the treatment of colorectal cancer and present a valuable        future research direction                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions        BKR performed the animal studies
