                    Introduction        The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy HAART can dramatically prolong the        life of individuals infected by human immunodeficiency virus  HIV  but early hopes        for virus eradication have not been realized  The successful use of HAART is limited by        drugrelated toxicities high costs and drug resistance  factors which have led to the        development of alternative therapeutic strategies including the use of supervised or        structured treatment interruption STI This approach involving recurrent limited        exposure to autologous virus has not been successful in chronic infection  but has        been shown to lead to at least transient containment of viremia after intervention in the        acute phase of infection in humans and animals exposed to AIDSassociated retroviruses                In the present study we performed a detailed longitudinal assessment of the impact of        early treatment followed by STIs in patients treated during acute or early HIV infection        The main hypothesis of the study was that early treatment of acute HIV infection followed        by STI would lead to immune boosting and subsequent control of viremia without the need for        drugs The primary endpoint was the time to viral rebound above  copiesml once or        above  copies for three determinations separated by a week each The early results of        this trial were previously reported showing that five of eight patients were able to        achieve a plasma viral load of  copiesml or less at a median of  mo off therapy         The current study investigates the frequency and durability of control achieved with this        intervention with followup to a median of  y after infection and with an increase in        size of the cohort to  patients Our results indicate that although the majority of        patients treated in the acute phase of infection go on to control HIV to less than         RNA copiesml plasma for at least  mo off therapy the ability to contain viremia below        this level over the long term is maintained in a minority of patients                    Methods                  Objective          The hypothesis of the study was that early treatment of acute HIV infection would          confer immunologic maturation and subsequent control of HIV without the need for          ongoing drug therapy Alternatively if a breakthrough of virus replication was observed          this would provide a boost in HIVspecific immunity after reinstitution of antiviral          therapy The primary endpoint was the time to viral rebound to more than  copiesml          or viral loads above  copiesml for three determinations separated by a week each          The secondary objective was to correlate immunologic and virologic parameters with any          observed effects including evolution of HIVspecific T helper and cytotoxic T          lymphocyte responses The original study protocol including the patient consent form and          the institutional review board approval can be found in Protocols SS                          Study Population          Fourteen patients presenting with acute or early HIV infection were enrolled in this          study between July  and January  Table  Acute HIV infection was defined by          the presence of HIV RNA in the plasma a negative or weakly positive HIV antibody by          HIV ELISA and the detection of no more than three bands in an HIV Western blot          early HIV infection was defined by a positive ELISA and confirmation of early infection          by either detuned negative ELISA or previously known negative ELISA All participants in          the study had symptoms compatible with the acute retroviral syndrome and were treated          with HAART one protease inhibitor and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors          within a median of  d range  from the onset of symptoms Study participants were          recruited from the Massachusetts General Hospital the Brigham and Womens Hospital and          the Fenway Community Heath Care Center in Boston All individuals gave written informed          consent to participate and the study was approved by the respective institutional review          boards and conducted in accordance with the human experimentation guidelines of the          Massachusetts General Hospital          Six of the  individuals were investigated in an interim study  These patients          were AC AS in  AC AS AC AS AC AS AC AS and AC          AS                          STIs          Entry criteria included treatment with HAART before or shortly after HIV          seroconversion viral suppression on HAART to less than  RNA copiesml for  mo HIV          viral load at the time of entry into the study of less than  RNA copiesml and lack of          significant mutations conferring drug resistance  Lymphocyte proliferative          response to recombinant HIV p protein had to exceed a stimulation index of ten before          treatment discontinuation and net counts per minute had to be  or greater All          antiretroviral drugs were discontinued simultaneously After a treatment interruption          patients were seen at least once a week for the first  wk and then monthly with a          total of at least  visits for the first year after cessation of therapy In the second          year visits continued monthly Treatment was restarted if viral load remained above           RNA copiesml plasma for greater than three consecutive weeks or was in excess of           copiesml on any single occasion                          Human Leukocyte Antigen Typing          High and intermediateresolution human leukocyte antigen class I typing was performed          at a commercial laboratory Dynal Biotech Oxford United Kingdom by sequencespecific          PCR as described                           Detection of GB Virus C RNA          GB virus C GBVC RNA was detected using a twostep nested PCR amplification reaction          from whole plasma RNA Briefly GBVC RNA was extracted from plasma using the Qiagen          Viral RNA Mini Kit Qiagen Valencia California United States according to the          manufacturers instructions Extracted RNA was reverse transcribed using the Qiagen          OneStep RTPCR Kit and amplified by nested PCR in both steps primers specific for the           UTR of GBVC were used as described previously                           Chemokine Receptor Genotyping          In order to analyze the chemokine receptor CCR  deletion polymorphism the          region spanning the nt deletion was amplified by PCR and the two alleles were          separated by gel electrophoresis  The CCRI polymorphism was detected by          PCRrestriction fragment length polymorphism analysis as described previously                           Synthetic HIV Peptides          We synthesized  synthetic peptides  amino acids long at the Massachusetts          General Hospital Peptide Core Facility on an automated peptide synthesizer using Fmoc          technology as described  Peptides overlapped by  amino acids and spanned the          entire HIV clade B  consensus sequence                          ELISPOT Assays          ELISPOT assays were carried out as described previously  Peripheral blood          mononuclear cells PBMCs were incubated overnight at  to  cellswell in          well polyvinylidene plates that had been precoated with  gml antihuman          interferon monoclonal antibody Mabtech Stockholm Sweden The final concentration of          the peptide per well was  gml The numbers of spots per well were counted using an          automated ELISPOT plate reader AID EliSpot reader system Autoimmune Diagnostika          Strassberg Germany A response was considered positive if there were more than           spotforming cells SFCs           PBMCs and if the well had at least three times the mean number of          SFCs in the three control wells The dependence of responses on CD T cells was          determined by measuring the depletion of CD T cells using the Minimacs cell depletion          system Miltenyi Biotec BergischGladbach Germany When HIVspecific CD T cell          responses were detected against adjacent peptides and therefore might represent          targeting of the overlap region responses to the weaker peptide were excluded for          calculations of magnitude and breadth as previously described                           Proliferation Assays          Freshly isolated PBMCs            cells were incubated with baculovirusderived recombinant p          protein Protein Sciences Meriden Connecticut United States at  gml for  d and          then pulsed with            H thymidine at  Ci for  h before harvesting as previously          described  A stimulation index of five or greater was considered significant                          Statistical Analysis          Time to failure during the different treatment interruptions was assessed by          KaplanMeier analysis Patients who were still controlling viremia at the time of last          visit who failed because they restarted therapy without meeting the criteria of          virologic failure or who were lost in followup were included in the analyses but the          data were censored at the last evaluable time point Equality of survival distributions          for the first and second treatment discontinuations was evaluated using the Wilcoxon          matchedpairs signedranks test CD T cell losses were calculated on regression lines          based on least squares fit A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for the          analysis of continuous variables such as days following onset of symptoms CD T cell          count HIV viral load and time to rebound of viremia as well as for the estimation of          hazard ratios for the categorical variables of ELISA Western Blot coreceptor          polymorphism and GBVC status Statistical analyses of CD and CD T cell responses          were based on a Students           t test a multiparametric ANOVA test a Wilcoxon matchedpairs          signedranks test or a MannWhitney           U test as indicated           p values lower than  were considered to indicate statistical          significance and all reported           p values are twosided Statistical analysis and graphical          presentation were performed using SPSS SAS and Prism software packages                            Results                  Longitudinal Assessment of Control of Viremia following Treated Acute or Early          Infection          Fourteen patients identified at the time of acute or early infection Table  Figure           were entered into this protocol and they were followed for a median of  y from the          time of infection range  d Patients underwent successive treatment          interruptions after an initial treatment period of at least  mo median  d range           d and were required to restart therapy when viral load exceeded  RNA          copiesml plasma on a single occasion or  copiesml for three consecutive weeks          For purposes of analysis patients who dropped out of the study or who reinitiated          therapy without meeting criteria were considered to have lost the ability to contain          viremia          Using these criteria for reinitiation of therapy and to define failure  of           patients  were able to achieve virologic control to less than  RNA copiesml          plasma for at least  d after one two or three treatment interruptions Table  The          period of longest containment was after one interruption for five patients after two          interruptions for eight patients and after three interruptions for one patient Table                    Once control was achieved the majority of the patients experienced a subsequent rise          in viremia The median time between cessation of therapy and rebound of viremia having a          viral load greater than  copiesml was  d range  d          Six of  patients  achieved a period of control after stopping therapy for  y          but only three of   were able to control viremia off therapy at less than           RNA copiesml plasma for more than  y Duration of viremia control during successive          treatment interruptions was highly variable and there was no increase in the          sustainability of viral containment during successive STI cycles The three patients          achieving control of viremia for more than  y did so during the first AC the          second AC and the third AC treatment interruption respectively Figure A A          paired comparison Wilcoxon matchedpairs signedranks test showed no significant          difference in the length of viremia control with subsequent treatment interruptions          Although patients experienced rebound viremia with discontinuation of therapy none of          the patients experienced recurrence of symptoms associated with acute HIV          infection          These data show that at least transient control of viremia to less than  RNA          copiesml plasma was achieved in the majority of study participants during at least one          of the treatment interruptions but that durable viral control in participants following          treated acute infection occurred infrequently Moreover the data do not show a          consistent pattern of augmentation of viral control with sequential treatment          interruptions                          Effect of Treatment Interruptions on CD T Cell Counts          Although viral load is a strong predictor of disease progression CD T cell loss is          an additional independent predictor  Early treatment of acute HIV infection led          to normalization of CD T cell counts in most patients median  cellsmm            range  but the effect of treatment interruption was          variable even in those doing well as defined by sustained low viral loads Overall           of  patients interrupted therapy for at least  mo and these individuals were          evaluated regarding the effect of treatment interruption on CD T cell loss Figure B          and C The rate of change in CD T cell counts during the first year of the longest          period off treatment ranged from  to  cellsmm           y median  Of the three patients who did not meet viral load          criteria for restarting therapy for more than  y one AC had an increasing CD T          cell count of  cellsmm           y one AC had a stable CD T cell count  cellsmm           y  and one AC experienced a decline of  cellsmm           y Comparison with data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study          MACS showed that the kinetics of CD T cell loss was faster MannWhitney           U test            p   than in untreated patients with early chronic HIV infection          average loss of  cellsmm           y in patients with a CD T cell count of more than  cellsmm           at baseline However CD T cell loss rate was in the same range          as what has been described after treatment interruption in chronic HIV infection           Analysis of CD T cell decline during the second year for the three individuals          who controlled viremia for more than  y revealed similar trends in CD T cell slopes          although they were less steep AC  cellsmm           y AC  cellsmm           y and AC  cellsmm           y When the first  mo off therapy were excluded in order to          minimize the potential effects of recent treatment on CD T cell number the rate of          change in CD T cell counts during the first year off therapy no longer differed          statistically from the MACS data median  cellmm           y range  to  MannWhitney           U test           p   A possible reason for steep CD T cell slopes may be high          CD T cell counts at time of treatment interruption Comparison with MACS data Figure          C showed that several of the study participants still behaved as outliers when this          factor was considered These results indicate that periods of relative control of viremia          were associated with declining CD T cell counts in most patients                          Correlation of Clinical and Genetic Markers with Duration of Viremia Control          Although the study was small we evaluated clinical and laboratory parameters to see          if any was predictive of duration of viral control Analyses included clinical and          laboratory parameters at time of presentation with acute HIV infection genetic markers          associated with different rates of disease progression and the presence or absence of          GBVC coinfection All patients presented with symptomatic acute infection Time between          onset of symptoms and institution of therapy did not affect duration of control following          STI Cox proportional hazards regression model           p  The individuals who controlled viremia for a longer time          either during the first STI or during any of the treatment interruptions were not          different from those who experienced earlier breakthrough as measured by ELISA and          Western blot status at initiation of HAART coreceptor polymorphisms CCRdelta CCR          VI or the presence or absence of GBVC coinfection Cox proportional hazards model           p  in all comparisons data not shown The only parameter          that was predictive of prolonged viral control during the first treatment interruption          was a low viremia at time of institution of therapy           p   there was a fold increase in hazard per order of          magnitude increase in viral load This factor was no longer predictive when the period of          longest control of viremia was considered The time to rebound of viremia           copiesml or  copiesml did not correlate with the duration of viral control          Although  out of  individuals achieved at least transient control of viremia and          three experienced prolonged control none of these patients possessed the HLA alleles B          or B associated with better disease outcome                           Relationship of Magnitude and Breadth of HIVSpecific CD T Cells to Duration of          Viremia Control          To assess the relationship between the clinical outcome and evolution of          HIVspecific CD T cells we longitudinally analyzed the breadth and magnitude of CD          T cell responses using an interferon ELISPOT and a panel of  overlapping peptides          spanning the entire HIV clade B consensus sequence At the beginning of the first STI          HIVspecific CD T cells were weak median of  SFCs           PBMCs Figure A and narrowly directed at a median of two epitopes          Figure B CD T cell responses increased significantly           p  during the first offtreatment period reaching a median          total magnitude of  SFCs           PBMCs and targeting a median of eight epitopes and then were          sustained when therapy was reintroduced A further increase in the magnitude and breadth          of HIVspecific CD T cells was observed in the subsequent offtreatment periods          although these augmentations failed to reach statistical significance The CD T          cellmediated immune responses emerging during these consecutive cycles of treatment          interruption were broadly directed targeting all structural and most accessory and          regulatory HIV gene products data not shown However the magnitude of HIVspecific          CD T cell responses at the beginning of the first           r             p   second           r             p   or third           r             p   treatment interruptions was not predictive of the time the          study participants were subsequently able to stay off therapy according to study          criteria          The periods off treatment allowed for assessment of the relationship between exposure          to virus and evolution of immune responses There was a highly significant positive          association between time until virologic failure during the first treatment interruption          and change in the magnitude of HIVspecific CD T cell responses           r             p  Figure C Similarly the longer a patient remained off          therapy during the second and third interruptions the greater the augmentation of the          total magnitude of HIVspecific CD T cell responses           r             p            r             p   respectively The increase in CD T cell epitopes targeted          during the first treatment interruption was also linearly correlated to the duration          until virological failure           r             p  Figure D However no significant relationship was          observed between the augmentation of epitopes targeted during the second and third          treatment pauses and the time the study participants were able to remain off therapy in          the respective treatment interruption These data suggest that the duration of a          treatment interruption and therefore the duration of exposure to plasma virus          correlates positively with the magnitude and breadth of HIVspecific CD T cell          responses that emerge during offtherapy time periods Yet CD T cell responses prior          to treatment interruptions were not significantly predictive of the duration of time that          patients are able to spontaneously control HIV replication as defined by the study          criteria                          Relationship of Magnitude of Lymphocyte Proliferative Responses to p Antigen to          Duration of Viremia Control          We next analyzed evolution of lymphoproliferative responses to recombinant HIV p          Gag protein in order to assess HIVspecific CD T cell function Most individuals had          no detectable response at baseline prior to treatment consistent with prior reports of          patients with acute HIV infection  After initiation of therapy all individuals          generated HIVspecific lymphoproliferative responses Figure E which was a criterion          for inclusion in the study During treatment interruptions there was a variable decline          in magnitude and comparisons between responses on the first day of treatment          interruption and last day off therapy did not reach statistical significance first STI           p   second           p   and third           p   respectively These HIVspecific CD T cell responses          also tended to rise with reinitiation of therapy and some of them were very robust with          stimulation indices over  detected in several individuals Figure E Similar to CD          T cell responses the magnitude of HIVspecific CD T helper cell responses at the          beginning of the first           r             p   Figure F second           r             p   or third           r             p   treatment interruption was not statistically predictive of          the time the study participants were subsequently able to stay off therapy according to          study criteria                            Discussion        Although early treatment of acute HIV infection followed by treatment interruptions        may enhance control of viremia  the durability of this control remains unclear Here        we analyzed the longterm impact of initiation of antiviral therapy during acute HIV        infection followed by STIs in a cohort of  patients Although initial control of viremia        to less than  RNA copiesml plasma was achieved in the majority of the individuals        studied a gradual increase in viremia and decline in CD T cell counts was observed in        most patients even after a year or more of viral containment Durable virologic control        occurred infrequently despite the presence of robust HIVspecific CD and CD T cell        responses detected by standard assays Moreover even during periods of successful control        of viremia progressive loss of CD T cells was frequently observed These data indicate        that although early treatment of acute and early infection is frequently associated with        transient control of viremia after STI ongoing lowlevel viral replication is associated        with ultimate virologic breakthrough in most patients        The standard immunologic assays and virologic assessments in this cohort revealed        considerable heterogeneity among the study participants and did not show a consistent        pattern in duration of viremia control during successive treatment interruptions Eleven of         patients  were able to maintain a viral load of less than  copiesml for at        least  d but progressive loss of control ensued in the majority of patients and only        three patients  were able to maintain control for more than  y These three patients        did so during the first AC the second AC and the third AC STI Clinical        genetic and immunological parameters did not distinguish these three individuals from the        other  patients nor did they predict the duration of control following treatment        interruption Indeed the longer a patient was off therapy the stronger and more broadly        directed the CD T cell responses became but these were still not sufficient to maintain        prolonged control in most patients Although three patients did not complete the study as        initially intended patient AC withdrew from the study after viral breakthrough on the        first STI AC restarted therapy despite a viral load of less than  copiesml during        both the first and second STIs and then withdrew and AC restarted therapy prematurely        during the second STI but then failed to control during the third STI the results are not        substantially different if these three are censored rather than considered to have failed        to control        Loss of viral control in this cohort occurred not only in the presence of strong CD T        cell responses but in most cases also in the presence of virusspecific CD T cell        responses although the CD T cell responses often declined during periods of viremia In        addition total CD T cell numbers were also monitored and declined in most patients over        time including one of the three patients who were able to maintain low viral loads for at        least  y Mechanisms leading to rapid CD T cell loss need to be further studied in        future STI trials Other parameters including chemokine receptor polymorphisms  and        GBVC coinfection  similarly failed to explain the different courses following        treatment interruption The only parameter found to be associated with longer control of        viremia during the first treatment interruption was a lower viral load at time of        institution of antiviral therapy Given the multiplicity of comparisons made the true        significance of this finding is uncertain        The reasons for progressive loss of control despite augmentation of virusspecific CD        and CD T cell responses remain to be defined In one individual AC HIV        superinfection in the setting of strong and broadly directed HIVspecific cellular immune        responses was associated with the loss of viral control as previously reported  No        other cases of superinfection have been identified in these patients data not shown The        immunologic studies performed failed to show an association between increases in viral load        and loss of immune responses but this may be due to the use of the current standard IFN        assays to quantify immune function Numerous studies now indicate that IFN production        alone is not associated with viral load  but rather that functional        characteristics of CD and CD T cells may be better associated with viral control         Such studies will be important to pursue In particular even a low level of        viremia correlates with a low or undetectable frequency of interleukinproducing        HIVspecific memory CD T cells endowed with proliferative capacity in vitro         thus abrogating CD T cell help crucial to maintain efficacy of CD T cell        functions In an interim study of a subset of six of the  patients presented here        patients AC AC AC AC AC and AC a fully differentiated effector        phenotype of HIVspecific CD T cells for selected epitopes was found to be associated        with better control of viremia  Other factors that may contribute include functional        defects in antigenspecific cellmediated immunity  and progressive immune        escape  HIVspecific humoral immunity can also affect viral control after        treatment interruption  and viral factors including viral fitness  and        infection with multiple viral variants  can influence viral set point and the rate of        disease progression Virus sequencing studies currently in progress in this cohort indicate        that viral breakthrough is associated with sequence changes within and outside known CTL        epitopes data not shown Full evaluation of the relationship between immune escape and        viral breakthrough will require extensive additional analyses including detailed analysis        of responses to autologous virus  Assessing the changes in CD and CD T cell        functions over time as well as viral evolution under immune selection pressure will be        important to evaluate immune correlates in this cohort        These data are important in light of other recent data on treatment interruption in both        acute and chronic infection In chronic HIV infection STI studies showed only marginal        if any improvements of HIV viremia control following a number of treatment interruptions        cycles despite at least transient increases in HIVspecific CD and CD T cell        responses  In the setting of infection with a multidrugresistant virus        this strategy may even be deleterious  Other studies of STI after treated acute HIV        infection have shown limited benefits  including recent trials such as the PrimSTOP        trial  and the QUEST study  However little is known about the relationship        between scheduling of HAART and treatment interruptions and the characteristics of viral        rebound after therapy has been discontinued        Although durable control of viremia was not achieved it is noteworthy that the majority        of patients were able to achieve transient relative containment of viremia providing        rationale for future studies aimed at further enhancing immune control Early treatment        alone should still be considered an important therapeutic option Therapeutic vaccinations        administered after treated acute HIV infection and before cessation of therapy have given        disappointing results thus far  but the availability of new and more potent immunogens        requires reassessment of this approach Indeed the ability to enhance CD T helper cell        responses in the chronic phase of infection has been demonstrated  but whether this        will enhance CD T cell function requires additional studies Some promising results have        been obtained using immunomodulatory drugs including cyclosporine  and hydroxyurea         in combination with antiviral therapy presumably because of the limitation of T cell        activation Administration of granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor blunted the        viral rebound following interruption of HAART and largely prevented a decrease of CD T        cell counts in an STI trial in chronic HIV infection  These additional therapeutic        interventions deserve further investigation in future STI studies        Although the present study shows progressive viral breakthrough it was not designed to        address whether there might be a change in set point viremia achieved or overall clinical        benefit through transient early treatment of acute HIV infection The definition of failure        chosen for this study was a viral load of greater than  RNA copiesml plasma which at        the time the study was initiated corresponded to the level of viremia at which treatment        was recommended Larger randomized trials will be needed to determine the potential        clinical and virologic benefit of approaches based on STIs In studies of untreated        infection there is only a fold difference in viremia separating the quartile with the        slowest disease progression from the quartile with the most rapid progression         suggesting that small differences in steadystate viremia may influence clinical outcome        In the meantime STI probably should be avoided outside the setting of controlled clinical        trials The data in this study may also be relevant to current efforts to develop a        therapeutic AIDS vaccine designed to retard disease progression rather than prevent        infection since they suggest that durable maintenance of lowlevel viremia may be        difficult to achieve
