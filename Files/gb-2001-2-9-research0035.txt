                    Background        The field of genomics has been expanding at a rapid pace        since the annotated         Escherichia coli K genome was        published in    with the current number of        published genomes exceeding  and with another  on        their way according to the Genomes OnLine Database GOLD          Deciphering the functions encoded by all gene products        of the genomes is the next big challenge in the field        Function attributions through experimental biochemical and        genetic analyses and through bioinformatic studies are        continuing and microarray technology is shedding        additional light on the functions associated with the gene        products of the organism in question The wealth of        biological information on         E coli is still increasing   and        is contributing to a better understanding of this organism        as well as of functions encoded in other organisms It is        therefore important that the most uptodate information on                E coli gene products is available        and used by researchers        Several databases have been assembled for various areas        of knowledge about the         E coli genome               Each compilation has a different emphasis and collects        different sets of information related to the function of        the gene products In the GenProtEC database we have been        curating information on physiological function and modular        construction of gene products Other databases most closely        related to ours include EcoCyc with emphasis on metabolic        pathways   the CGSC database with information on the        genotypes and phenotypes of mutant strains   and        EcoGene which includes information on gene        reconstructions alternative gene boundaries and verified        aminoterminal aminoacid sequences of the mature proteins          The         E coli genome project at the        University of WisconsinMadison presents genome data on         E coli K and pathogenic        enterobacteria          We present a functional update for         E coli K gene products that        incorporates information from the literature and referenced        databases obtained since the  GenBank deposit Our        focus has been the biological function of the gene        products Coding sequences CDSs encoding proteins whose        function previously was imputed or not known were        reevaluated and putative functions were assigned by        manually evaluating the results from BLAST and DARWIN

   For the initial annotation of the           E coli K genome             genes were identified with Blattner numbers Bnums          Among the genes  were believed to encode proteins          and  to encode RNAs Since then six Bnums have been          retired bo bo bo bo bo and bo G          Plunkett personal communication In addition three new          genes have been identified and assigned to Bnums These          include the proteincoding b            yaeP SWISSPROT P and b                     thiS SWISSPROT  and the          RNA encoding b The current number of           E coli genes is  with           encoding proteins and  encoding RNAs          MAGPIE identified  candidate CDSs that were          assigned to MAGPIE identifiers Magnums see MAGPIE            for details The  CDSs identified by Bnums were          also identified with Magnums Variations were detected          for either the start or stop positions for  of these          CDSs resulting in differences in the encoded proteins          ranging from  to  amino acids the latter in PtsA          Bnum b Magnum ec The other Magnumidentified          candidate CDSs include retired Bnums six Magnums CDSs          located between the boundaries of Bnums  Magnums          and CDSs overlapping existing Bnums  Magnums Among          the Magnums located between the boundaries of Bnums are           CDSs that encode proteins of  or more amino acids          One such CDS identified by MAGPIE Magnum ec is          located between b and b and encodes a protein of           amino acids The carboxyterminal  amino acids of          this CDS are identical to the aminoacid sequence of the          recently characterized betalactam resistance protein Blr          SWISSPROT P located at the same position            Other Magnums located between Bnum boundaries may          correspond to short           E coli proteins                          Functional annotation of E coliK gene          products          The functional assignments of the           E coli gene products in the          November  GenBank U deposit represented an          accumulation of information retrieved from the literature          collected in the GenProtEC and EcoCyc databases as well          as imputed functions based on similarity of a known          protein to the translated sequences   Since the          deposit to GenBank was made our database GenProtEC has          continually been updated with knowledge on           E coli gene products appearing in          the literature    Information on transcriptional          regulators has been incorporated from the work of J          ColladoVides    and transport protein          information has been adapted from the work of MH Saier          and IT Paulsen    GenProtEC also contains          imputed function assignments based on sequence similarity          to orthologous or paralogous proteins on gene operon          location and on phenotypes of mutants            Gene products whose functions were known were not          considered further for the functional update The          remaining  CDSs whose gene products had a putative          or unknown function assignment were analyzed using BLAST          and DARWIN BLAST analyses were carried out for both the          Bnum and the Magnumderived protein sequences The          results for the Bnumderived protein sequences and the          automatic functions predicted by MAGPIE or HERON          humanemulated reasoning for objective notations were          manually evaluated and imputed functions were assigned          Although the manual annotation step could not compete          with the speed of the automatic annotation process of          HERON it provided us with more useful function          descriptions A comparison of the manually assigned          putative functions with the HERON predicted functions          showed that when leaving aside issues of specificity a          nearly equivalent function was predicted in  of the          cases whereas in  of the cases less information was          obtained with HERON          After the function update of the  CDSs           gene products were assigned a putative function and           gene products were described by a phenotype The          remaining gene products were given one of the following          three assignments conserved protein where          sequencesimilar matches were found but the function          could not be determined in the absence of consistent          functions reported for the matching sequences conserved          hypothetical protein where sequencesimilar matches          existed but these had no associated function unknown          CDS where the translated sequence had no known sequence          match outside           E coli The current function          description includes  conserved proteins           conserved hypothetical proteins and  unknown CDSs The           gene products with no function assignment represent           of the           E coli chromosomal genes and the          unknown CDSs at this time represent  of           E coli genes          A sample of the annotated           E coli K genes is shown in          Table  Each gene is identified by a Bnum Magnum gene          product type and gene product Function April  A          complete

 through GenProtEC            Many changes are evident when comparing the updated          annotation to that of  The number of CDSs without          function assignment has been reduced from  to

of the proteins encoded in the           E coli genome have arisen through          fusion of two or more genes Examples of such gene          fusions are the multifunctional enzymes Aas          acylglycerophosphoethanolamine acyl transferase and          acylacyl carrier protein synthetase and GmU            N acetyl glucosaminephosphate          uridyltransferase and glucosaminephosphate acetyl          transferase    We have chosen to deal with          proteins as modular entities where a module is defined as          a protein element that has at least  aminoacid          residues carries a biological function and is presumed          to have an independent evolutionary history   Most          modules in           E coli are individual proteins          They can however also be part of a protein where          multiple modules have been joined by gene fusion as is          the case for Aas and GmU Other protein types in           E coli such as transporters and          regulators also involve gene fusion events The current          modular assignments are based on analysis of protein          sequences within           E coli K P Liang and M          Riley unpublished data          There are at present  compound genes identified in          the           E coli genome each containing two          to four modules Table contains a list of multimodular          proteins where each module encodes a distinct function          Enzymes transporters and regulators are all present in          the list The majority of modular proteins  contain          modules belonging to different paralogous groups data          not shown Other multimodular proteins appear to be a          result of internal duplication  genes or a          combination of gene fusion and duplication  genes          The           E coli chromosome is currently          represented by  genes encoding  RNAs and           protein modules Additional modules are expected to be          identified upon analysis of protein sequences from other          genomes P Liang and M Riley unpublished data          Examples are the bifunctional proteins ThrA          aspartokinase I and homoserine dehydrogenase I and MetL          aspartokinase II and homoserine dehydrogenase II where          only the aminoterminal modules representing the kinase          activities have been identified on the basis of their          sequence similarity to the           E coli unimodular aspartokinase          III LysC Both the aminoterminal aspartokinase and the          carboxyterminal homoserine dehydrogenase activities of          ThrA and MetL have been verified with biochemical and          genetic tools    The module representing the          dehydrogenase activity has not been identified by          matching internal paralogs as           E coli itself does not contain a          unimodular sequencesimilar dehydrogenase           Saccharomyces cerevisiae however          does contain a unimodular sequencesimilar homoserine          dehydrogenase DhoM SWISSPROT P which can be          used in identifying the carboxyterminal module Thus by          detecting orthologous matches to parts of genes we will          be able to identify additional multimodular proteins                          Current status          Table presents a summary of the gene products encoded          in the           E coli K genome represented as          modular entities Half of the modules have been          experimentally characterized Enzymes are the largest          gene product type representing  of the          characterized gene products and  of the total gene          products Other major gene product types are transporters          and regulators Among the remaining modules  have          function predictions The gene products without a          function assignment still constitute a significant          portion of the           E coli genome  of modules A          summary of the development of information on           E coli gene products over the past          eight years is shown in Table  It is evident that much          knowledge has been gained since these analyses began in                                         Discussion        An updated version of the function assignments for         E coli K gene products has been        presented using the genes identified in the GenBank U        deposit Alternative gene boundaries were produced by        MAGPIE The MAGPIE genome annotation system also identified        candidate CDSs that may represent gene products not        identified in the GenBank U deposit Small ORFs with        biological activity are likely to be abundant in the        organism but await verification by biological data        Undoubtedly the intergenic regions of         E coli K as studied by Rudd          and Bachellier         et al   are also important for        the function and regulation of gene products        The percentage of identified chromosomal gene products        without a function assignment is decreasing and is        currently  Only  of         E coli genes have no match in        current sequence databases This number will be further        reduced with the release of the annotated genomes of         Salmonella Shigella and other        closely related organisms Preliminary data show that the        number of unknown CDSs ORFs encoding proteins without        sequencesimilar matches will be less than  after data        on the         Salmonella typhimurium genome is        included MHS unpublished data        The function assignments presented here mainly represent        the molecular functions of the gene products With the        generation of microarray data gene products will also be        characterized to a greater degree by the role they play in        the cell under specific conditions We have recently        developed a classification system for cellular functions of                E coli K gene products and have        assigned more than one cellular role to some gene products        where this is appropriate   There is also a need for a        more uniform way of describing both the molecular and        cellular roles of gene products among diverse organisms        and this issue is currently being addressed by the Gene        Ontology Consortium                      Conclusions        We have presented a functional update of the gene        products encoded by the genes of         E coli K identified in the        GenBank Accession U deposit The         E coli proteins were treated as        modular entities where a module is at least  amino        acids carries a biological function and has an        independent evolutionary history The functional update was        performed by manual evaluation of the data obtained from        GenProtEC BLAST and DARWIN analyses and MAGPIE        annotation A table containing the updated function        assignments of         E coli K gene products is        available as an additional data file online and at        GenProtEC   and MAGPIE   We believe these data will        be valuable for analysis of         E coli K itself as well as for        the analysis of gene products encoded by other genomes                    Materials and methods                  Automated annotation                      MAGPIE ORF prediction            A threestep approach to ORF prediction was taken to            prepare the MAGPIE project for             E coli GLIMMER  with a            minimum ORF length of  nucleotides was initially used            to create the base set of predictions   Glimmer             was run with all default parameters as recommended            in the documentation   and trained on the annotated            set of ORFs from the Blattner             et al release of               Because GLIMMER selectively identifies ORFs that match            a statistical model of a gene for the organism              GLIMMER may miss genes that were laterally transferred            or acquired more recently from other genomes We            therefore chose to combine the GLIMMER predictions with            those of a syntactic tool encoded within MAGPIE This            tool identifies stop codons and then backtracks to            the farthest upstream acceptable inframe start codon            and defines this as the ORF   A nonredundant set            of all GLIMMER ORFs plus syntactic ORFs between GLIMMER            ORFs was generated Finally ORFs annotated by Blattner                        et al that were not present in            the nonredundant set were added to the MAGPIE            project                                BLAST analysis            The CDSs were compared to the NCBI nucleotide nt            and nonredundant protein nr databases using gapped            BLAST   Proteinsequence motifs were identified by            PROSITE   A search against the MAGPIEpredicted            proteins of over  completed genomes including the            previously annotated             E coli set was also            performed                                Functional annotation            Automated function annotation was provided using            HERON Description lines with low information content            for example descriptions containing words such as            hypothetical or putative were filtered out HERON            then calculated word frequencies in the remaining            descriptions identified the top three most common            words and selected the description of the            highestscoring sequence match for homology            comparisons with one or more highfrequency words The            selected description became the automated annotation            for the coding region                                    Manual annotation                      BLAST analysis            The protein sequences collected from GenBank            Accession U were compared to the nr database using            gapped BLAST                                  DARWIN analysis            DARWIN version  was used to detect            sequencesimilar proteins within             E coli K and in  additional            microbial genomes   P Liang and M Riley            unpublished data In addition to orthologous matches            groups of paralogous proteins of             E coli K were generated on            the basis of the DARWIN results In our hands DARWIN            is particularly successful in identifying distant            sequence similarities a consequence no doubt of the            application of multiple substitution matrices optimized            for the organism and to each sequence pair                                Functional annotation            Functions were assigned to gene products on the            basis of a manual evaluation of the results from the            BLAST and DARWIN analyses The automatic function            prediction was also taken into account In addition to            incorporating recent experimental information a            substantial amount of human judgment was brought to            bear                                      Additional data files        A complete table of the current  Bnumsis provided        as an Excel file        Additional data file
