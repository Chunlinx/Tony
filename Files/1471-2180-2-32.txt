                    Background        The Secdependent protein export pathway of         Escherichia coli is responsible for        translocation of secretory proteins across the inner        membrane to final destinations in the periplasm or outer        membrane Secretory proteins also called preproteins are        synthesized with a cleavable amino terminal signal sequence        that functions both to slow folding of the preprotein and        to aid in recognition of the secretory protein by export        factors Export of many but not all secretory proteins is        dependent on interaction with SecB a cytoplasmic chaperone        that maintains the preprotein in a loosely folded        conformation competent for translocation Both SecB and the        preprotein provide binding sites for SecA a peripheral        membrane ATPase SecA targets the preprotein to the        membranous translocase complex composed of SecY SecE        SecG SecD SecF and YajC Formation of the complete        translocase complex promotes an ATP binding and hydrolysis        cycle by SecA that results in segmental translocation of        the secretory protein across the membrane               The signal sequence is crucial for efficient        translocation mutations in the signal sequence        significantly reduce export of the preprotein and complete        deletions of the signal sequence eliminate essentially all        export        Selection for extragenic suppressors        of such export defective preproteins led to the        identification of the         prl alleles of         secY          prlA          secE          prlG          secA          prlD  and more recently         secG          prlH         Early        hypotheses predicted that the Prl suppressors function by        expanded or altered interactions with signal sequences        facilitating recognition of mutant as well as wild type        signal sequences            More recent observations support an alternative        mechanism of action for the PrlASecY and PrlGSecE        suppressors      First PrlAGmediated suppression        does not exhibit allele specificity all         prlA and all         prlG alleles that have been examined        suppress all signal sequence mutations implying that        suppression is not due to a specific altered interaction        that allows recognition of a mutant signal sequence             Furthermore all of the         prlA and         prlG alleles suppress complete        deletions of the signal sequence suggesting that an        interaction between the signal sequence and the Prl        suppressor is not necessary for suppression or even for        export       Based on these observations it was        proposed that the PrlA and PrlG suppressors do not function        through altered interactions with signal sequences but        rather by loss of recognition      The wild type SecE        and SecY proteins are thought to function in concert to        proofread the signal sequence of secretory proteins        rejecting defective precursors from the export pathway The        PrlA SecY and PrlG SecE suppressors are compromised in        their ability to proofread allowing export of proteins        with mutations or even complete deletions of the signal        sequence        This proofreading model predicts that the critical step        for translocation of a signal sequencedefective secretory        protein is recognition by SecB and subsequent presentation        to SecEY SecB binds portions of the mature secretory        protein         and SecA would bind to the        SecBprecursor complex by virtue of its ability to bind        SecB     as well as the preprotein              Thus SecAmediated targeting of the preprotein to        translocase would occur In a wild type cell the mutant        precursor would be rejected at this point by SecYE but in        a PrlA or PrlG suppressor strain rejection would not occur        and the mutant secretory protein would be exported        In fact all of the PrlA and PrlG suppressors are        completely dependent on functional SecB for manifestation        of suppressor activity      Even certain proteins that        are not normally SecBdependent for translocation become        SecBdependent when they contain a signal sequence mutation        and are exported via the suppressor pathway For example        PhoA is normally exported independent of SecB Deletion of        the signal sequence from         phoA severely compromises export        export is restored in a         prlA suppressor strain However this        suppression is dependent on SecB     Therefore there        are characteristics of the mature portion of PhoA that        promote recognition by SecB and this recognition is        essential for PrlAmediated suppression        Although         prlA and         prlG strains export secretory        proteins that completely lack a signal sequence there is        no evidence of export of any cytoplasmic proteins in a         prl suppressor strain     That        is proteins that are supposed to remain in the cytoplasm        are not mislocalized to the periplasm It has been        suggested that perhaps cytoplasmic proteins are not        exported in         prl suppressor strains because they        fold rapidly and escape recognition by SecB while        secretory proteins even those lacking a signal sequence        fold more slowly allowing time for SecB recognition and        binding      SecB binds to a variety of unfolded        proteins in vitro      although binding appears to        be more selective in vivo     This selectivity may be        based on the slower folding characteristics of secretory        proteins        Therefore we proposed previously that if a cytoplasmic        protein contains a mutation that slows its rate of folding        SecB will recognize and bind to that mutant protein        Binding of SecB would result in targeting of the unfolded        protein to the translocation apparatus According to the        proofreading model in a wild type strain SecE and SecY        would reject the unfolded protein due to lack of a signal        sequence In a Prl suppressor strain however the        proofreading function would be compromised and the mutant        protein would be exported     In the experiments        described here we tested this hypothesis by examining the        export of such a cytoplasmic protein with a folding        mutation The results indicate that slow folding is not        sufficient for SecB binding and subsequent targeting to        translocase and further that secretory proteins contain        targeting information in addition to the signal sequence        and the folding kinetics                    Results and Discussion                  Localization of N LTand LAN LT          Plasmids pKL and pKL encoding LAN LTFLAG          or N LTFLAG respectively were transformed into          strains IM wild type           secY  or IM            prlA  These strains contained          deletion mutations in the           lon and           degP genes to limit proteolysis in          both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic spaces Following          induction of the  repressor fragment whole cell          lysates spheroplasts and periplasmic fractions were          prepared from each strain Samples were analyzed by          Western blotting using antibodies directed against the          FLAG epitope present at the carboxyl terminus of the           repressor fragments          According to our hypothesis the largely unfolded          nature of LAN LTshould allow SecB to bind          resulting in targeting of LAN LTto translocase In          the           secY wild type strain proofreading          by SecEY would block export of LAN LT while in          the           prlA strain the PrlA suppressor          would allow export of a portion of LAN LTto the          periplasm This was not the result we observed Fig           No LAN LTwas detected in the periplasm even in the                    prlA strain indicating that          export did not occur to any significant extent To ensure          that all periplasmic contents were released during the          spheroplast preparation the blots were stripped of FLAG          antibody and reprobed with antibody directed against          MalE a periplasmic binding protein All detectable MalE          was present in the periplasmic fractions data not          shown demonstrating that complete release of the          periplasmic contents had been attained Therefore there          was no detectable export of LAN LTin the           prlA strain          There were two reasonable explanations for this          unexpected finding  an unfolded state is not          sufficient for SecB binding or  SecB binding is not          sufficient to promote export in a           prl suppressor strain To          distinguish between these possibilities we examined          whether SecB was able to bind LAN LTusing two          different methods to identify interactions The first          approach was coimmunoprecipitation of LAN LTSecB          complexes the second was an in vitro protease protection          assay                          Coimmunoprecipitation of SecB complexes          Coimmunoprecipitations were performed using whole          cell lysates of strains induced for expression of           repressor Immunoprecipitations were performed as          described using antibodies directed either against SecB          or against the His tag on the  repressor Following the          immunoprecipitation reaction samples were analyzed by          Western blotting using the opposite antibody that is          samples that had been immunoprecipitated with antiSecB          were examined with antiHis while those that had been          precipitated with antiHis were probed with antiSecB In          addition as a positive control the interaction of SecB          with the secretory protein LamB was examined using          antiLamB antibodies While an interaction between LamB          and SecB was clearly seen Fig c no interaction was          observed between SecB and either N LTor LAN          LTFig aand b This was true regardless of whether          the precipitating antibody was directed against SecB or          the His tag The wild type N LTwas not expected to          interact with SecB as it would fold very rapidly and          stably it was more surprising that no interaction was          detected between SecB and the destabilized LAN LT          This result implied that the unfolded nature of LAN          LTwas not sufficient for SecB binding                          Protease protection assays          To substantiate the results observed by          coimmunoprecipitation an in vitro protease protection          assay was employed SecB has a proteolyticsensitive          domain that is cleaved by proteinase K in a limited          proteolysis reaction When substrate is bound to SecB          the conformation is altered such that the site is no          longer protease accessible rendering SecB protease          resistant     Thus this assay can be used to detect          binding of SecB to a substrate PolyLlysine and small          peptides are routinely used as substrates for this          analysis as demonstrated in Fig lanes  and  To          determine whether a larger protein was also able to          protect SecB we used purified ureadenatured proOmpA as          a substrate The proOmpA also was able to bind to and          protect SecB Fig  lanes  and  although a much          higher concentration of substrate was required to achieve           protection To ensure that the observed protection          was not due simply to the high protein concentration in          the reaction a nonsecretory protein was used as a          negative control BSA was added to the same concentration          or higher as proOmpA with no resultant protection of SecB          data not shown Therefore this assay reliably serves          as an additional method to observe SecBsubstrate          interactions          The  repressor proteins were purified on a nickel          affinity chromatography column by virtue of the His tag          at the carboxyl terminus of the proteins Each was          assayed for protection of SecB at concentrations up to          and exceeding that used for proOmpA Neither N LTnor          LAN LTprotected SecB from proteolysis indicating          that no binding occurred Fig  lanes  Although          the mutant LAN LTis predicted to be in an unfolded          conformation in the bacterial cell the protease          protection assay was performed at C To verify that          refolding of LAN LTat this temperature was not          interfering with interpretation of the results we          further tested the SecB binding activity by incubating          LAN LTin  M urea then diluting it into the          protection reaction similar to the conditions used for          proOmpA Again no protection was detected data not          shown These results demonstrated that even when fully          unfolded LAN LTwas not a substrate for SecB          binding                            Conclusions        The hypothesis driving the present studies was premised        on the observation that         prl suppressor strains are able to        correctly identify secretory proteins even in the absence        of a signal sequence It has been widely thought that this        recognition was due to slow folding of secretory proteins        in the cytoplasm resulting in binding by SecB and        subsequent targeting to translocase While slow folding may        be a necessary criterion for export the data presented        here indicate that an unfolded nature is not sufficient for        SecB binding and targeting This conclusion is based on        failure of the LAN LTprotein to bind SecB either in        vivo or in vitro The in vivo results are founded both on        the coimmunoprecipitation experiments and on the fact that        no export of the protein was detected in a         prlA strain while the in vitro        results are based on the protease protection assays        Therefore we conclude that secretory proteins must contain        information in addition to the signal sequence and slow        folding characteristics that targets them to the secretory        pathway or that cytoplasmic proteins contain information        that prevents export even if the folding parameters are        altered Further studies are underway to identify such        targeting sequences                    Methods                  Bacterial strains and

University          of Toronto and Robert Sauer MIT In pKL the wild          type  repressor is tagged with the myc epitope and the          LA  repressor has the FLAG epitope In pKL the          wild type  repressor contains the FLAG eiptope and the          LA mutant has the myc epitope In all experiments only          antibodies to the FLAG epitope were used therefore          pKL resulted in detection of the mutant  repressor          and pKL was used to observe the wild type Plasmids          pIM and pIM were used in the coimmunoprecipitation          assays and for purification of the  repressor fragments          These plasmids are derivatives of pETc that contain a          single copy of the  repressor either wild type pIM          or LA pIM The  repressor inserts contain a FLAG          tag at the carboxyl terminus followed by a hexahistidine          motif                          Bacterial growth induction and          fractionations          Plasmidcontaining bacteria were
