                        FORESIGHTAND HINDSIGHT            In composing this narrative we have tried to remember that we write with the benefit                and the handicap of hindsight Hindsight can sometimes see the past clearlywith                 vision But the path of what happened is so brightly lit that it places                everything else more deeply into shadow Commenting on Pearl Harbor Roberta                Wohlstetter found it much easier after the event to sort the relevant from the                irrelevant signals After the event of course a signal is always crystal clear we                can now see what disaster it was signaling since the disaster has occurred But                before the event it is obscure and pregnant with conflicting meanings                        As time passes more documents become available and the bare facts of what happened                become still clearer Yet the picture of how those things happened becomes harder to                reimagine as that past world with its preoccupations and uncertainty recedes and                the remaining memories of it become colored by what happened and what was written                about it later With that caution in mind we asked ourselves before we judged                others whether the insights that seem apparent now would really have been                meaningful at the time given the limits of what people then could reasonably have                known or done            We believe the  attacks revealed four kinds of failures in imagination policy                capabilities and management            IMAGINATION             Historical Perspective            The  attack was an event of surpassing disproportion America had suffered                surprise attacks beforePearl Harbor is one wellknown case the  Chinese attack                in Korea another But these were attacks by major powers While by no means as                threatening as Japans act of war the  attack was in some ways more                devastating It was carried out by a tiny group of people not enough to man a full                platoon Measured on a governmental scale the resources behind it were trivial The                group itself was dispatched by an organization based in one of the poorest most                remote and least industrialized countries on earth This organization recruited a                mixture of young fanatics and highly educated zealots who could not find suitable                places in their home societies or were driven from them            To understand these events we attempted to reconstruct some of the context of the                s Americans celebrated the end of the Cold War with a mixture of relief and                satisfaction The people of the United States hoped to enjoy a peace dividend as                US spending on national security was cut following the end of the Soviet military                threat            The United States emerged into the postCold War world as the globes preeminent                military power But the vacuum created by the sudden demise of the Soviet Union                created fresh sources of instability and new challenges for the United States                President George HW Bush dealt with the first of these in  and  when he                led an international coalition to reverse Iraqs invasion of Kuwait Other examples                of US leaders handling new threats included the removal of nuclear weapons from                Ukraine Belarus and Kazakhstan the NunnLugar threat reduction program to help                contain new nuclear dangers and international involvement in the wars in Bosnia and                Kosovo America stood out as an object for admiration envy and blame This created                a kind of cultural asymmetry To us Afghanistan seemed very far away To members of                al Qaeda America seemed very close In a sense they were more globalized than we                were            Understanding the Danger            If the governments leaders understood the gravity of the threat they faced and                understood at the same time that their policies to eliminate it were not likely to                succeed any time soon then historys judgment will be harsh Did they understand                the gravity of the threat            The US government responded vigorously when the attack was on our soil Both Ramzi                Yousef who organized the  bombing of the World Trade Center and Mir Amal                Kansi who in  killed two CIA employees as they waited to go to work in Langley                Virginia were the objects of relentless uncompromising and successful efforts to                bring them back to the United States to stand trial for their crimes            Before  al Qaeda and its affiliates had killed fewer than  Americans                including the East Africa embassy bombings and the Cole attack The US government                took the threat seriously but not in the sense of mustering anything like the kind                of effort that would be gathered to confront an enemy of the first second or even                third rank The modest national effort exerted to contain Serbia and its                depredations in the Balkans between  and  for example was orders of                magnitude larger than that devoted to al Qaeda            As best we can determine neither in  nor in the first eight months of  did                any polling organization in the United States think the subject of terrorism                sufficiently on the minds of the public to warrant asking a question about it in a                major national survey Bin Ladin al Qaeda or even terrorism was not an important                topic in the  presidential campaign Congress and the media called little                attention to it            If a president wanted to rally the American people to a warlike effort he would need                to publicize an assessment of the growing al Qaeda danger Our government could                spark a full public discussion of who Usama Bin Ladin was what kind of organization                he led what Bin Ladin or al Qaeda intended what past attacks they had sponsored or                encouraged and what capabilities they were bringing together for future assaults                We believe American and international public opinion might have been differentand                so might the range of options for a presidenthad they been informed of these                details Recent examples of such debates include calls to arms against such threats                as Serbian ethnic cleansing biological attacks Iraqi weapons of mass destruction                global climate change and the HIVAIDS epidemic            While we now know that al Qaeda was formed in  at the end of the Soviet                occupation of Afghanistan the intelligence community did not describe this                organization at least in documents we have seen until  A National                Intelligence Estimate distributed in July  predicted future terrorist attacks                against the United Statesand in the United States It warned that this danger would                increase over the next several years It specified as particular points of                vulnerability the White House the Capitol symbols of capitalism such as Wall                Street critical infrastructure such as power grids areas where people congregate                such as sports arenas and civil aviation generally It warned that the  World                Trade Center bombing had been intended to kill a lot of people not to achieve any                more traditional political goal            This  estimate described the greatest danger as transient groupings of                individuals that lacked strong organization but rather are loose affiliations                They operate outside traditional circles but have access to a worldwide network of                training facilities and safehavens This was an excellent                summary of the emerging danger based on what was then known            In  the intelligence community received new information making clear that                Bin Ladin headed his own terrorist group with its own targeting agenda and                operational commanders Also revealed was the previously unknown involvement of Bin                Ladins organization in the  attack on a Yemeni hotel quartering US military                personnel the  shootdown of US Army Black Hawk helicopters in Somalia and                quite possibly the  Riyadh bombing of the American training mission to the Saudi                National Guard The  update of the  estimate did not discuss the new                intelligence It did state that the terrorist danger depicted in  would persist                In the updates summary of key points the only reference to Bin Ladin was this                sentenceIran and its surrogates as well as terrorist financier Usama Bin Ladin                and his followers have stepped up their threats and surveillance of US facilities                abroad in what also may be a portent of possible additional attacks in the United                    States Bin Ladin was mentioned in only two other                sentences in the sixpage report The al Qaeda organization was not mentioned The                 update was the last national estimate on the terrorism danger completed before                                            From  to  a number of very good analytical papers were distributed on                specific topics These included Bin Ladins political philosophy his command of a                global network analysis of information from terrorists captured in Jordan in                December  al Qaedas operational style and the evolving goals of the Islamist                extremist movement Many classified articles for morning briefings were prepared for                the highest officials in the government with titles such as Bin Ladin Threatening                to Attack US Aircraft with antiaircraft missiles June Strains Surface                Between Taliban and Bin Ladin January  Terrorist Threat to US Interests in                Caucasus June  Bin Ladin to Exploit Looser Security During                HolidaysDecember Bin Ladin Evading Sanctions March Bin Ladins                Interest in Biological Radiological Weapons February  Taliban Holding Firm                on Bin Ladin for Now March Terrorist Groups Said Cooperating on US Hostage                Plot May  and Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in the US August                         Despite such reports and a  paper on Bin Ladins command structure for al Qaeda                there were no complete portraits of his strategy or of the extent of his                organizations involvement in past terrorist attacks Nor had the intelligence                community provided an authoritative depiction of his organizations relationships                with other governments or the scale of the threat his organization posed to the                United States            Though Deputy DCI John McLaughlin said to us that the cumulative output of the                Counterterrorist Center CTC dramatically eclipsed any analysis that could have                appeared in a fresh National Intelligence Estimate he conceded that most of the                work of the Centers  to person analytic group dealt with collection                    issues                        In late  DCI GeorgeTenet recognized the deficiency of strategic analysis against                al Qaeda To tackle the problem within the CTC he appointed a senior manager who                briefed him in March  on creating a strategic assessment capability The CTC                established a new strategic assessments branch during July  The decision to add                about ten analysts to this effort was seen as a major bureaucratic victory but the                CTC labored to find them The new chief of this branch reported for duty on                September                          Whatever the weaknesses in the CIAs portraiture both Presidents Bill Clinton and                George Bush and their top advisers told us they got the picturethey understood Bin                Ladin was a danger But given the character and pace of their policy efforts we do                not believe they fully understood just how many people al Qaeda might kill and how                soon it might do it At some level that is hard to define we believe the threat had                not yet become compelling            It is hard now to recapture the conventional wisdom before  For example a New                York Times article in April  sought to debunk claims that Bin Ladin was a                terrorist leader with the headline US Hard Put to Find Proof Bin Laden Directed                    Attacks The head of analysis at the CTC until                 discounted the alarms about a catastrophic threat as relating only to the danger of                chemical biological or nuclear attackand he downplayed even that writing several                months before It would be a mistake to redefine counterterrorism as a task of                dealing with catastrophicgrand or super terrorism when in fact these labels                do not represent most of the terrorism that the United States is likely to face or                most of the costs that terrorism imposes on US interests                        Beneath the acknowledgment that Bin Ladin and al Qaeda presented serious dangers                there was uncertainty among senior officials about whether this was just a new and                especially venomous version of the ordinary terrorist threat America had lived with                for decades or was radically new posing a threat beyond any yet experienced Such                differences affect calculations about whether or how to go to war            Therefore those government experts who saw Bin Ladin as an unprecedented new danger                needed a way to win broad support for their views or at least spotlight the areas                of dispute and perhaps prompt action across the government The national estimate                has often played this role and is sometimes controversial for this very                    reason                        Such assessments which provoke widespread thought and debate have a major impact on                their recipients often in a wider circle of decisionmakers The National                Intelligence Estimate is noticed in the Congress for example But as we have said                none was produced on terrorism between  and             By  the government still needed a decision at the highest level as to whether al                Qaeda was or was not a first order threat Richard Clarke wrote in his first memo                to Condoleezza Rice on January   In his blistering protest about                footdragging in the Pentagon and at the CIA sent to Rice just a week before                 he repeated that the real question for the principals was are we serious about                dealing with the al Qida threat    Is al Qida a big deal One school of                thought Clarke wrote in this September  note implicitly argued that the terrorist                network was a nuisance that killed a score of Americans every  months If that                view was credited then current policies might be proportionate Another school saw                al Qaeda as the point of the spear of radical Islam But no one forced the                argument into the open by calling for a national estimate or a broader discussion of                the threat The issue was never joined as a collective debate by the US                government including the Congress before             We return to the issue of proportionand imagination Even Clarkes note challenging                Rice to imagine the day after an attack posits a strike that kills hundreds of                Americans He did not write thousands            Institutionalizing Imagination The Case of Aircraft as Weapons            Imagination is not a gift usually associated with bureaucracies For example before                Pearl Harbor the US government had excellent intelligence that a Japanese attack                was coming especially after peace talks stalemated at the end of November                 These were days one historian notes of excruciating uncertainty The most likely                targets were judged to be in Southeast Asia An attack was comingbut officials                were at a loss to know where the blow would fall or what more might be done to                prevent it In retrospect available intercepts pointed                to Japanese examination of Hawaii as a possible target But another historian                observesin the face of a clear warning alert measures bowed  to routine            It is therefore crucial to find a way of routinizing even bureaucratizing the                exercise of imagination Doing so requires more than finding an expert who can                imagine that aircraft could be used as weapons Indeed since al Qaeda and other                groups had already used suicide vehicles namely truck bombs the leap to the use of                other vehicles such as boats the Cole attack or planes is not farfetched Yet                these scenarios were slow to work their way into the thinking of aviation security                experts In  as a result of the TWA Flight  crash President Clinton created                a commission under Vice President Al Gore to report on shortcomings in aviation                security in the United States The Gore Commissions report having thoroughly                canvassed available expertise in and outside of government did not mention suicide                hijackings or the use of aircraft as weapons It focused mainly on the danger of                placing bombs onto aircraftthe approach of the Manila air plot The Gore Commission                did call attention however to lax screening of passengers and what they carried                onto planes In late  reports came in of a possible al Qaeda plan to hijack a                plane One a December  Presidential Daily Briefing for President Clinton                reprinted in chapter  brought the focus back to more traditional hostage taking                it reported Bin Ladins involvement in planning a hijack operation to free prisoners                such as the Blind Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman Had the contents of this PDB been                brought to the attention of a wider group including key members of Congress it                might have brought much more attention to the need for permanent changes in domestic                airport and airline security procedures                        Threat reports also mentioned the possibility of using an aircraft filled with                explosives The most prominent of these mentioned a possible plot to fly an                explosivesladen aircraft into a US city This report circulated in September                 originated from a source who had walked into an American consulate in East                Asia In August of the same year the intelligence community had received                information that a group of Libyans hoped to crash a plane into the World Trade                Center In neither case could the information be corroborated In addition an                Algerian group hijacked an airliner in  most likely intending to blow it up                over Paris but possibly to crash it into the Eiffel Tower                        In  a private airplane had crashed onto the south lawn of the White House In                early  Abdul Hakim MuradRamzi Yousef s accomplice in the Manila airlines                bombing plottold Philippine authorities that he and Yousef had discussed flying a                plane into CIA headquarters                        Clarke had been concerned about the danger posed by aircraft since at least the                 Atlanta Olympics There he had tried to create an air defense plan using assets from                the Treasury Department after the Defense Department declined to contribute                resources The Secret Service continued to work on the problem of airborne threats                to the Washington region In  Clarke chaired an exercise designed to highlight                the inadequacy of the solution This paper exercise involved a scenario in which a                group of terrorists commandeered a Learjet on the ground in Atlanta loaded it with                explosives and flew it toward a target in Washington DC Clarke asked officials                from the Pentagon Federal Aviation Administration FAA and Secret Service what                they could do about the situation Officials from the Pentagon said they could                scramble aircraft from Langley Air Force Base but they would need to go to the                President for rules of engagement and there was no mechanism to do so There was no                clear resolution of the problem at the exercise                        In late  a great deal of discussion took place in the media about the crash off                the coast of Massachusetts of EgyptAir Flight  a Boeing  The most plausible                explanation that emerged was that one of the pilots had gone berserk seized the                controls and flown the aircraft into the sea After the  millennium                alerts when the nation had relaxed Clarke held a meeting of his Counterterrorism                Security Group devoted largely to the possibility of a possible airplane hijacking                by al Qaeda                        In his testimony Clarke commented that he thought that warning about the possibility                of a suicide hijacking would have been just one more speculative theory among many                hard to spot since the volume of warnings of al Qaeda threats and other terrorist                threats was in the tens of thousandsprobably hundreds of thousandsYet the                possibility was imaginable and imagined In early August  the FAAs Civil                Aviation Security intelligence office summarized the Bin Ladin hijacking threat                After a solid recitation of all the information available on this topic the paper                identified a few principal scenarios one of which was a suicide hijacking                operation The FAA analysts judged such an operation unlikely because it does not                offer an opportunity for dialogue to achieve the key goal of obtaining Rahman and                other key captive extremists    A suicide hijacking is assessed to be an option                of last resort                        Analysts could have shed some light on what kind of opportunity for dialogue al                Qaeda desired                        The CIA did not write any analytical assessments of possible hijacking scenarios            One prescient pre analysis of an aircraft plot was written by a Justice                Department trial attorney The attorney had taken an interest apparently on his own                initiative in the legal issues that would be involved in shooting down a US                aircraft in such a situation                        The North American Aerospace Defense Command imagined the possible use of aircraft as                weapons too and developed exercises to counter such a threatfrom planes coming to                the United States from overseas perhaps carrying a weapon of mass destruction None                of this speculation was based on actual intelligence of such a threat One idea                intended to test command and control plans and NORADs readiness postulated a                hijacked airliner coming from overseas and crashing into the Pentagon The idea was                put aside in the early planning of the exercise as too much of a distraction from                the main focus war in Korea and as too unrealistic As we pointed out in chapter                 the military planners assumed that since such aircraft would be coming from                overseas they would have time to identify the target and scramble                    interceptors                        We can therefore establish that at least some government agencies were concerned                about the hijacking danger and had speculated about various scenarios The challenge                was to flesh out and test those scenarios then figure out a way to turn a scenario                into constructive action            Since the Pearl Harbor attack of  the intelligence community has devoted                generations of effort to understanding the problem of forestalling a surprise                attack Rigorous analytic methods were developed focused in particular on the                Soviet Union and several leading practitioners within the intelligence community                discussed them with us These methods have been articulated in many ways but almost                all seem to have at least four elements in common  think about how surprise                attacks might be launched  identify telltale indicators connected to the most                dangerous possibilities  where feasible collect intelligence on these                indicators and  adopt defenses to deflect the most dangerous possibilities or at                least trigger an earlier warning            After the end of the Gulf War concerns about lack of warning led to a major study                conducted for DCI Robert Gates in  that proposed several recommendations among                them strengthening the national intelligence officer for warning We were told that                these measures languished under Gatess successors Responsibility for warning                related to a terrorist attack passed from the national intelligence officer for                warning to the CTC An Intelligence Community Counterterrorism Board had the                responsibility to issue threat advisories                        With the important exception of analysis of al Qaeda efforts in chemical biological                radiological and nuclear weapons we did not find evidence that the methods to                avoid surprise attack that had been so laboriously developed over the years were                regularly applied            Considering what was not done suggests possible ways to institutionalize imagination                To return to the four elements of analysis just mentioned             The CTC did not analyze how an aircraft hijacked or explosivesladen might be                used as a weapon It did not perform this kind of analysis from the enemys                perspective red team analysis even though suicide terrorism had become a                principal tactic of Middle Eastern terrorists If it had done so we believe such an                analysis would soon have spotlighted a critical constraint for the                terroristsfinding a suicide operative able to fly large jet aircraft They had                never done so before              The CTC did not develop a set of telltale indicators for this method of attack                For example one such indicator might be the discovery of possible terrorists                pursuing flight training to fly large jet aircraft or seeking to buy advanced                flight simulators             The CTC did not propose and the intelligence community collection management                process did not set requirements to monitor such telltale indicators Therefore the                warning system was not looking for information such as the July  FBI report of                potential terrorist interest in various kinds of aircraft training in Arizona or                the August  arrest of Zacarias Moussaoui because of his suspicious behavior in a                Minnesota flight school In late August the Moussaoui arrest was briefed to the DCI                and other top CIA officials under the heading Islamic Extremist Learns to                    Fly Because the system was not tuned to comprehend                the potential significance of this information the news had no effect on warning             Neither the intelligence community nor aviation security experts analyzed systemic                defenses within an aircraft or against terroristcontrolled aircraft suicidal or                otherwise The many threat reports mentioning aircraft were passed to the FAA While                that agency continued to react to specific credible threats it did not try to                perform the broader warning functions we describe here No one in the government was                taking on that role for domestic vulnerabilities            Richard Clarke told us that he was concerned about the danger posed by aircraft in                the context of protecting the Atlanta Olympics of  the White House complex and                the  G summit in Genoa            But he attributed his awareness more to Tom Clancy novels than to warnings from the                intelligence community He did not or could not press the government to work on                the systemic issues of how to strengthen the layered security defenses to protect                aircraft against hijackings or put the adequacy of air defenses against suicide                hijackers on the national policy agenda            The methods for detecting and then warning of surprise attack that the US                government had so painstakingly developed in the decades after Pearl Harbor did not                fail instead they were not really tried They were not employed to analyze the                enemy that as the twentieth century closed was most likely to launch a surprise                attack directly against the United States            POLICY            The road to  again illustrates how the large unwieldy US government tended to                underestimate a threat that grew ever greater The terrorism fostered by Bin Ladin                and al Qaeda was different from anything the government had faced before The                existing mechanisms for handling terrorist acts had been trial and punishment for                acts committed by individuals sanction reprisal deterrence or war for acts by                hostile governments The actions of al Qaeda fit neither category Its crimes were                on a scale approaching acts of war but they were committed by a loose farflung                nebulous conspiracy with no territories or citizens or assets that could be readily                threatened overwhelmed or destroyed Early in  DCI Tenet and Deputy Director                for Operations James Pavitt gave an intelligence briefing to Presidentelect Bush                Vice Presidentelect Cheney and Rice it included the topic of al Qaeda Pavitt                recalled conveying that Bin Ladin was one of the gravest threats to the                    country                        Bush asked whether killing Bin Ladin would end the problem Pavitt said he and the                DCI had answered that killing Bin Ladin would have an impact but would not stop the                threat The CIA later provided more formal assessments to the White House                reiterating that conclusion It added that in the long term the only way to deal                with the threat was to end al Qaedas ability to use Afghanistan as a sanctuary for                its operations                        Perhaps the most incisive of the advisors on terrorism to the new administration was                the holdover Richard Clarke Yet he admits that his policy advice even if it had                been accepted immediately and turned into action would not have prevented                     We must then ask when the US government had                reasonable opportunities to mobilize the country for major action against al Qaeda                and its Afghan sanctuary The main opportunities came after the new information the                US government received in  after the embassy bombings of August                 after the discoveries of the Jordanian and Ressam plots in late  and after the                attack on the USS Cole in October             The US policy response to al Qaeda before  was essentially defined following                the embassy bombings of August  We described those decisions in chapter  It                is worth noting that they were made by the Clinton administration under extremely                difficult domestic political circumstances Opponents were seeking the Presidents                impeachment In addition in  President Clinton was preparing the government                for possible war against Serbia and he had authorized major air strikes against                Iraq            The tragedy of the embassy bombings provided an opportunity for a full examination                across the government of the national security threat that Bin Ladin posed Such an                examination could have made clear to all that issues were at stake that were much                larger than the domestic politics of the moment But the major policy agencies of                the government did not meet the threat The diplomatic efforts of the Department of                State were largely ineffective Al Qaeda and terrorism was just one more priority                added to alreadycrowded agendas with countries like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia                After  that changed            Policymakers turned principally to the CIA and covert action to implement policy                Before  no agency had more responsibilityor did moreto attack al Qaeda                working day and night than the CIA But there were limits to what the CIA was able                to achieve in its energetic worldwide efforts to disrupt terrorist activities or use                proxies to try to capture or kill Bin Ladin and his lieutenants As early as                mid one CIA officer wrote to his supervisor All were doing is holding the                ring until the cavalry gets here                        Military measures failed or were not applied Before  the Department of Defense                was not given the mission of ending al Qaedas sanctuary in Afghanistan            Officials in both the Clinton and Bush administrations regarded a full US invasion                of Afghanistan as practically inconceivable before  It was never the subject of                formal interagency deliberation            Lesser forms of intervention could also have been considered One would have been the                deployment of US military or intelligence personnel or special strike forces to                Afghanistan itself or nearbyopenly clandestinely secretly or covertly with                their connection to the United States hidden Then the United States would no                longer have been dependent on proxies to gather actionable intelligence However it                would have needed to secure basing and overflight support from neighboring                countries A significant political military and intelligence effort would have                been required extending over months and perhaps years with associated costs and                risks Given how hard it has proved to locate Bin Ladin even today when there are                substantial ground forces in Afghanistan its odds of sucess are hard to calculate                We have found no indication that President Clinton was offered such an intermediate                choice or that this option was given any more consideration than the idea of                invasion These policy challenges are linked to the problem of imagination we have                already discussed Since we believe that both President Clinton and President Bush                were genuinely concerned about the danger posed by al Qaeda approaches involving                more direct intervention against the sanctuary in Afghanistan apparently must have                seemedif they were considered at allto be disproportionate to the threat            Insight for the future is thus not easy to apply in practice It is hardest to mount                a major effort while a problem still seems minor Once the danger has fully                materialized evident to all mobilizing action is easierbut it then may be too                late            Another possibility short of putting US personnel on the ground was to issue a                blunt ultimatum to the Taliban backed by a readiness to at least launch an                indefinite air campaign to disable that regimes limited military capabilities and                tip the balance in Afghanistans ongoing civil war The United States had warned the                Taliban that they would be held accountable for further attacks by Bin Ladin against                Afghanistans US interests The warning had been given in  again in late                 once more in the fall of  and again in the summer of  Delivering it                repeatedly did not make it more effective As evidence of al Qaedas responsibility                for the Cole attack came in during November  National Security Advisor Samuel                Berger asked the Pentagon to develop a plan for a sustained air campaign against the                Taliban Clarke developed a paper laying out a formal specific ultimatum But                Clarkes plan apparently did not advance to formal consideration by the Small Group                of principals We have found no indication that the idea was briefed to the new                administration or that Clarke passed his paper to them although the same team of                career officials spanned both administrations            After  President Bush announced that al Qaeda was responsible for the attack on                the USS Cole Before  neither president took any action Bin Ladins inference                may well have been that attacks at least at the level of the Cole were risk                    free                        CAPABILITIES            Earlier chapters describe in detail the actions decided on by the Clinton and Bush                administrations Each president considered or authorized covert actions a process                that consumed considerable timeespecially in the Clinton administration and                achieved little success beyond the collection of intelligence After the August                 missile strikes in Afghanistan naval vessels remained on station in or near the                region prepared to fire cruise missiles General Hugh Shelton developed as many as                 different strike options and did not recommend any of them The most extended                debate on counterterrorism in the Bush administration before  had to do with                missions for the unmanned Predator whether to use it just to locate Bin Ladin or to                wait until it was armed with a missile so that it could find him and also attack                him Looking back we are struck with the narrow and unimaginative menu of options                for action offered to both President Clinton and President Bush            Before  the United States tried to solve the al Qaeda problem with the same                government institutions and capabilities it had used in the last stages of the Cold                War and its immediate aftermath These capabilities were insufficient but little                was done to expand or reform them            For covert action of course the White House depended on the Counterterrorist Center                and the CIAs Directorate of Operations Though some officers particularly in the                Bin Ladin unit were eager for the mission most were not The higher management of                the directorate was unenthusiastic The CIAs capacity to conduct paramilitary                operations with its own personnel was not large and the Agency did not seek a                largescale general expansion of these capabilities before  James Pavitt the                head of this directorate remembered that covert action promoted by the White                House had gotten the Clandestine Service into trouble in the past He had no desire                to see this happen again He thought not unreasonably that a truly serious                counterterrorism campaign against an enemy of this magnitude would be business                primarily for the military not the Clandestine Service                        As for the Department of Defense some officers in the Joint Staff were keen to help                Some in the Special Operations Command have told us that they worked on plans for                using Special Operations Forces in Afghanistan and that they hoped for action                orders JCS Chairman General Shelton and General Anthony Zinni at Central Command                had a different view Shelton felt that the August  attacks had proved a waste                of good ordnance and thereafter consistently opposed firing expensive Tomahawk                missiles merely at jungle gym terrorist training infrastructure                        In this view he had complete support from Defense Secretary William Cohen Shelton                was prepared to plan other options but he was also prepared to make perfectly clear                his own strong doubts about the wisdom of any military action that risked US lives                unless the intelligence was actionable                        The high price of keeping counterterrorism policy within the restricted circle of the                Counterterrorism Security Group and the highestlevel principals was nowhere more                apparent than in the military establishment After the August  missile strike                other members of the JCS let the press know their unhappiness that in conformity                with the GoldwaterNichols reforms Shelton had been the only member of the JCS to                be consulted Although followon military options were briefed more widely the vice                director of operations on the Joint Staff commented to us that intelligence and                planning documents relating to al Qaeda arrived in a ziplock red package and that                many flag and general officers never had the clearances to see its contents                        At no point before  was the Department of Defense fully engaged in the mission of                countering al Qaeda though this was perhaps the most dangerous foreign enemy then                threatening the United States The Clinton administration effectively relied on the                CIA to take the lead in preparing longterm offensive plans against an enemy                sanctuary The Bush administration adopted this approach although its emerging new                strategy envisioned some yet undefined further role for the military in addressing                the problem Within Defense both Secretary Cohen and Secretary Donald Rumsfeld gave                their principal attention to other challenges            Americas homeland defenders faced outward NORAD itself was barely able to retain                any alert bases Its planning scenarios occasionally considered the danger of                hijacked aircraft being guided to American targets but only aircraft that were                coming from overseas We recognize that a costly change in NORADs defense posture                to deal with the danger of suicide hijackers before such a threat had ever actually                been realized would have been a tough sell But NORAD did not canvass available                intelligence and try to make the case The most serious weaknesses in agency                capabilities were in the domestic arena In chapter  we discussed these                institutionsthe FBI the Immigration and Naturalization Service the FAA and                others The major pre effort to strengthen domestic agency capabilities came in                 as part of a millennium afteraction review President Clinton and his                principal advisers paid considerable attention then to border security problems but                were not able to bring about significant improvements before leaving office The                NSCled interagency process did not effectively bring along the leadership of the                Justice and Transportation departments in an agenda for institutional change            The FBI did not have the capability to link the collective knowledge of agents in the                field to national priorities The acting director of the FBI did not learn of his                Bureaus hunt for two possible al Qaeda operatives in the United States or about his                Bureaus arrest of an Islamic extremist taking flight training until September                 The director of central intelligence knew about the FBIs Moussaoui investigation                weeks before word of it made its way even to the FBIs own assistant director for                counterterrorism            Other agencies deferred to the FBI In the August  PDB reporting to President Bush                of  fullfield investigations related to al Qaeda news the President said he                found heartening the CIA had simply restated what the FBI had said No one looked                behind the curtain            The FAAs capabilities to take aggressive anticipatory security measures were                especially weak Any serious policy examination of a suicide hijacking scenario                critiquing each of the layers of the security system could have suggested changes                to fix glaring vulnerabilitiesexpanding nofly lists searching passengers                identified by the CAPPS screening system deploying Federal Air Marshals                domestically hardening cockpit doors alerting air crew to a different kind of                hijacking than what they had been trained to expect or adjusting the training of                controllers and managers in the FAA and NORAD            Government agencies also sometimes display a tendency to match capabilities to                mission by defining away the hardest part of their job They are often passive                accepting what are viewed as givens including that efforts to identify and fix                glaring vulnerabilities to dangerous threats would be too costly too controversial                or too disruptive            MANAGEMENT            Operational Management            Earlier in this report we detailed various missed opportunities to thwart the                 plot Information was not shared sometimes inadvertently or because of legal                misunderstandings Analysis was not pooled Effective operations were not launched                Often the handoffs of information were lost across the divide separating the foreign                and domestic agencies of the government            However the specific problems are labeled we believe they are symptoms of the                governments broader inability to adapt how it manages problems to the new                challenges of the twentyfirst century The agencies are like a set of specialists                in a hospital each ordering tests looking for symptoms and prescribing                medications What is missing is the attending physician who makes sure they work as                a team            One missing element was effective management of transnational operations Action                officers should have drawn on all available knowledge in the government This                management should have ensured that information was shared and duties were clearly                assigned across agencies and across the foreigndomestic divide            Consider for example the case of Mihdhar Hazmi and their January  trip to                Kuala Lumpur detailed in chapter  In late  the National Security Agency                NSA analyzed communications associated with a man named Khalid a man named Nawaf                and a man named Salem Workinglevel officials in the intelligence community knew                little more than this But they correctly concluded that Nawaf  and Khalidmight                be part of an operational cadre and that something nefarious might be afoot The                NSA did not think its job was to research these identities It saw itself as an                agency to support intelligence consumers such as CIA The NSA tried to respond                energetically to any request made But it waited to be asked If NSA had been asked                to try to identify these people the agency would have started by checking its own                database of earlier information from these same sources Some of this information                had been reported some had not But it was all readily accessible in the database                NSAs analysts would promptly have discovered who Nawaf was that his full name                might be Nawaf al Hazmi and that he was an old friend of Khalid            With this information and more that was available managers could have more                effectively tracked the movement of these operatives in southeast Asia With the                name Nawaf al Hazmi a manager could then have asked the State Department also to                check that name State would promptly have found its own record on Nawaf al Hazmi                showing that he too had been issued a visa to visit the United States Officials                would have learned that the visa had been issued at the same placeJeddahand on                almost the same day as the one given to Khalid al Mihdhar            When the travelers left Kuala Lumpur for Bangkok local officials were able to                identify one of the travelers as Khalid al Mihdhar After the flight left they                learned that one of his companions had the name Alhazmi But the officials did not                know what that name meant            The information arrived at Bangkok too late to track these travelers as they came in                Had the authorities there already been keeping an eye out for Khalid al Mihdhar as                part of a general regional or worldwide alert they might have tracked him coming                in Had they been alerted to look for a possible companion named Nawaf al Hazmi                they might have noticed him too Instead they were notified only after Kuala Lumpur                sounded the alarm By that time the travelers had already disappeared into the                streets of Bangkok On January  the head of the CIAs al Qaeda unit told his                bosses that surveillance in Kuala Lumpur was continuing He may not have known that                in fact Mihdhar and his companions had dispersed and the tracking was falling apart                US officials in Bangkok regretfully reported the bad news on January  The names                they had were put on a watchlist in Bangkok so that Thai authorities might notice                if the men left the country On January  the head of the CIAs al Qaeda unit                again updated his bosses telling them that officials were continuing to track the                suspicious individuals who had now dispersed to various countries            Unfortunately there is no evidence of any tracking efforts actually being undertaken                by anyone after the Arabs disappeared into Bangkok No other effort was made to                create other opportunities to spot these Arab travelers in case the screen in                Bangkok failed Just from the evidence in Mihdhars passport one of the logical                possible destinations and interdiction points would have been the United States Yet                no one alerted the INS or the FBI to look for these individuals They arrived                unnoticed in Los Angeles on January  In early March  Bangkok reported that                Nawaf al Hazmi now identified for the first time with his full name had departed                on January  on a United Airlines flight to Los Angeles Since the CIA did not                appreciate the significance of that name or notice the cable we have found no                evidence that this information was sent to the FBI            Even if watchlisting had prevented or at least alerted US officials to the entry of                Hazmi and Mihdhar we do not think it is likely that watchlisting by itself have                prevented the  attacks Al Qaeda adapted to the failure of some of its                operatives to gain entry into the United States None of these future hijackers was                a pilot Alternatively had they been permitted entry and surveilled some larger                results might have been possible had the FBI been patient These are difficult                whatifs The intelligence community might have judged that the risks of conducting                such a prolonged intelligence operation were too highpotential terrorists might                have been lost track of for example The pre  FBI might not have been judged                capable of conducting such an operation But surely the intelligence community would                have preferred to have the chance to make these choices            From the details of this case or from the other opportunities we catalogue in the                text box one can see how hard it is for the intelligence community to assemble                enough of the puzzle pieces gathered by different agencies to make some sense of                them and then develop a fully informed joint plan Accomplishing all this is                especially difficult in a transnational case We sympathize with the workinglevel                officers drowning in information and trying to decide what is important or what                needs to be done when no particular action has been requested of them            Who had the job of managing the case to make sure these things were done One answer                is that everyone had the job The CIAs deputy director for operations James                Pavitt stressed to us that the responsibility resided with all involved Above all                he emphasized the primacy of the field The field had the lead in managing                operations The job of headquarters he stressed was to support the field and do                so without delay If the field asked for information or other support the job of                headquarters was to get itright away                        This is a traditional perspective on operations and traditionally it has had great                merit It reminded us of the FBIs pre emphasis on the primacy of its field                offices When asked about how this traditional structure would adapt to the                challenge of managing a transnational case one that hopped from place to place as                this one did the deputy director argued that all involved were responsible for                making it work Pavitt underscored the responsibility of the particular field                location where the suspects were being tracked at any given time On the other hand                he also said that the Counterterrorist Center was supposed to manage all the moving                parts while what happened on the ground was the responsibility of managers in the                    field                        Headquarters tended to support and facilitate trying to make sure everyone was in                the loop From time to time a particular post would push one way or headquarters                would urge someone to do something But headquarters never really took                responsibility for the successful management of this case Hence the managers at CIA                headquarters did not realize that omissions in planning had occurred and they                scarcely knew that the case had fallen apart The director of the Counterterrorist                Center at the time Cofer Black recalled to us that this operation was one among                many and that at the time it was considered interesting but not heavy water                yet He recalled the failure to get the word to Bangkok fast enough but has no                evident recollection of why the case then dissolved unnoticed                        The next level down the director of the al Qaeda unit in CIA at the time recalled                that he did not think it was his job to direct what should or should not be done He                did not pay attention when the individuals dispersed and things fell apart There                was no conscious decision to stop the operation after the trail was temporarily lost                in Bangkok He acknowledged however that perhaps there had been a letdown for his                overworked staff after the extreme tension and long hours in the period of the                millennium alert                        The details of this case illuminate real management challenges past and future The                US government must find a way of pooling intelligence and using it to guide the                planning of and assignment of responsibilities for joint operations involving                organizations as disparate as the CIA the FBI the State Department the military                and the agencies involved in homeland security            Institutional Management            Beyond those daytoday tasks of bridging the foreigndomestic divide and matching                intelligence with plans the challenges include broader management issues pertaining                to how the top leaders of the government set priorities and allocate resources Once                again it is useful to illustrate the problem by examining the CIA since before                 this agencys role was so central in the governments counterterrorism efforts            On December   DCI Tenet issued a directive to several CIA officials and his                deputy for community management statingWe are at war I want no resources or                people spared in this effort either inside CIA or the Community                        The memorandum had little overall effect on mobilizing the CIA or the intelligence                    community                        The memo was addressed only to CIA officials and the deputy for community management                Joan Dempsey She faxed the memo to the heads of the major intelligence agencies                after removing covert action sections Only a handful of people received it The NSA                director at the time Lieutenant General Kenneth Minihan believed the memo applied                only to the CIA and not the NSA because no one had informed him of any NSA                shortcomings For their part CIA officials thought the memorandum was intended for                the rest of the intelligence community given that they were already doing all they                could and believed that the rest of the community needed to pull its weight                        The episode indicates some of the limitations of the DCIs authority over the                direction and priorities of the intelligence community especially its elements                within the Department of Defense The DCI has to direct agencies without controlling                them He does not receive an appropriation for their activities and therefore does                not control their purse strings He has little insight into how they spend their                resources Congress attempted to strengthen the DCIs authority in  by creating                the positions of deputy DCI for community management and assistant DCIs for                collection analysis and production and administration But the authority of these                positions is limited and the vision of central management clearly has not been                realized            The DCI did not develop a management strategy for a war against Islamist terrorism                before  Such a management strategy would define the capabilities the                intelligence community must acquire for such a warfrom language training to                collection systems to analysts Such a management strategy would necessarily extend                beyond the CTC to the components that feed its expertise and support its operations                linked transparently to counterterrorism objectives It would then detail the                proposed expenditures and organizational changes required to acquire and implement                these capabilities            DCI Tenet and his deputy director for operations told us they did have a management                strategy for a war on terrorism It was to rebuild the CIA They said the CIA as a                whole had been badly damaged by prior budget constraints and that capabilities                needed to be restored across the board Indeed the CTC budget had not been cut                while the budgets had been slashed in many other parts of the Agency By restoring                funding across the CIA a rising tide would lift all boats They also stressed the                synergy between improvements of every part of the Agency and the capabilities that                the CTC or stations overseas could draw  on in the war on terror            As some officials pointed out to us there is a tradeoff in this management approach                In an attempt to rebuild everything at once the highest priority efforts might not                get the maximum support that they need Furthermore this approach attempted to                channel relatively strong outside support for combating terrorism into backing for                acrosstheboard funding increases Proponents of the counterterrorism agenda might                respond by being less inclined to loosen the purse strings than they would have been                if offered a convincing counterterrorism budget strategy The DCIs management                strategy was also focused mainly on the CIA            Lacking a management strategy for the war on terrorism or ways to see how funds were                being spent across the community DCI Tenet and his aides found it difficult to                develop an overall intelligence community budget for a war on terrorism            Responsibility for domestic intelligence gathering on terrorism was vested solely in                the FBI yet during almost all of the Clinton administration the relationship                between the FBI Director and the President was nearly nonexistent The FBI Director                would not communicate directly with the President His key personnel shared very                little information with the National Security Council and the rest of the national                security community As a consequence one of the critical working relationships in                the counterterrorism effort was broken            The Millennium Exception            Before concluding our narrative we offer a reminder and an explanation of the one                period in which the government as a whole seemed to be acting in concert to deal                with terrorismthe last weeks of December  preceding the millennium            In the period between December  and early January  information about                terrorism flowed widely and abundantly The flow from the FBI was particularly                remarkable because the FBI at other times shared almost no information That from                the intelligence community was also remarkable because some of it reached                officialslocal airport managers and local police departments who had not seen such                information before and would not see it again before  if then And the                terrorist threat in the United States even more than abroad engaged the frequent                attention of high officials in the executive branch and leaders in both houses of                Congress            Why was this so Most obviously it was because everyone was already on edge with the                millennium and possible computer programming glitches YK that might obliterate                records shut down power and communication lines or otherwise disrupt daily life                Then Jordanian authorities arrested  al Qaeda terrorists planning a number of                bombings in that country Those in custody included two US citizens Soon after                an alert Customs agent caught Ahmed Ressam bringing explosives across the Canadian                border with the apparent intention of blowing up Los Angeles airport He was found                to have confederates on both sides of the border            These were not events whispered about in highly classified intelligence dailies or                FBI interview memos The information was in all major newspapers and highlighted in                network television news Though the Jordanian arrests only made page  of the New                York Times they were featured on every evening newscast The arrest of Ressam was                on front pages and the original story and its followups dominated television news                for a week FBI field offices around the country were swamped by calls from                concerned citizens Representatives of the Justice Department the FAA local police                departments and major airports had microphones in their faces whenever they showed                    themselves                        After the millennium alert the government relaxed Counterterrorism went back to                being a secret preserve for segments of the FBI the Counterterrorist Center and                the Counterterrorism Security Group But the experience showed that the government                was capable of mobilizing itself for an alert against terrorism While one factor                was the preexistence of widespread concern about YK another at least equally                important was simply shared information Everyone knew not only of an abstract                threat but of at least one terrorist who had been arrested in the United States                Terrorism had a facethat of Ahmed Ressamand Americans from Vermont to southern                California went on the watch for his like            In the summer of  DCI Tenet the Counterterrorist Center and the                Counterterrorism Security Group did their utmost to sound a loud alarm its basis                being intelligence indicating that al Qaeda planned something big But the                millennium phenomenon was not repeated FBI field offices apparently saw no abnormal                terrorist activity and headquarters was not shaking them up Between May  and                September  there was very little in newspapers or on television to heighten                anyones concern about terrorism Frontpage stories touching on the subject dealt                with the windup of trials dealing with the East Africa embassy bombings and Ressam                All this reportage looked backward describing problems satisfactorily resolved                Backpage notices told of tightened security at embassies and military installations                abroad and government cautions against travel to the Arabian Peninsula All the rest                was secret
