        ready   okay uh what what what what exactly were talking about uh industries trends everything   social changes well whatever whatever i guess you want to whether things changed over the last uh twenty years   okay all right well start twenty years back and come forward hows that sound   all right good enough here we go   all right     well uh lets see i guess some of the some of the things uh civil rights have come a long way i guess in the last twenty years   well yeah i think they have i i really do and its its no longer the issue it once was and im kind of glad least i i hope thats a good sign that uh   yeah yeah thats true   uh the times have changed uh more to the more equitable at least   yeah and i guess i guess uh womens rights have come with that too i guess so thats uh   uh yeah i think they have too i dont think womens rights have come as far   probably not   uh i i think that uh in general women would feel like they still sort of getting the bum deal compared to uh say some of the minority groups   umhum umhum   uh i know my wife would   yeah yeah   yeah but uh i dont know uh seems like we come uh a long ways in terms of  the economies of of things uh       if i recall back in the sixties we didnt tend to run a debt all the time but we did run a debt a lot with the great society a lot seventies and so forth   thats true yeah   and then uh it looked like we just stayed in some sort of a economic economic economic morass ever since   thats right whats i guess uh part of that was that uh twenty twenty five years ago Japan wasnt uh  hello   hello were there   okay that twenty twenty five years ago that Japan wasnt uh wasnt what it is now so that thats probably caused some changes   right i can remember yeah i can remember in the late sixties early seventies you couldnt even uh hardly find a Japanese car around   umhum   and uh what few there were around were very ugly looking things mustve been   oh yeah like uh like the old Subarus and uh the old old Datsuns   yeah yeah they mustve been pretty reliable though because some of them they built up a fairly good following and it appears thats the case do you own any kind of foreign car   umhum uh no we dont as a matter of fact   i dont either ive always just uh i dont know whether you call it buy American its just that ive always bought Fords and i guess ill just keep buying Fords   yeah yeah and uh       but uh what else what else has changed oh i guess uh Watergate was in there so i guess politics politics in general has kind of kind of gone downhill   uh but well   in the last because i can i can remember maybe before Nixon that uh the presidents were really up on a pedestal   some of the ethical aspects of political life certainly seem to have gone downhill and certain   yeah or else we or else we know about it now one or the other   yeah in certain respects i feel like that the uh uh Reagan administration coming right off the Carter administration did tend to bring back a more aggressive uh uh aspect to the human rights issues and the sort of things that democracy in this country has really stood for and and you know and uh brought it back to the limelight compared to the sixties and seventies   yeah umhum   and i think that was a positive uh positive thing but it seems like uh uh with all that uh we never seem to be able to get our house in order when it comes to the economic things i i bring this back to that at least uh it seems like we still continue to run uh uh heavy uh indebted indebted budgets and the like i dont see any real way out of it either i might add   yeah no no i theres no easy answer thats for sure or else they wouldve uh done something by now i guess   yeah well yeah yeah i think thats true   but uh and probably the only other thing i can think of in the last uh oh twenty years or so i guess is that uh family structures have changed a lot   yeah i think they have too seems like that uh the countrys might been more uh migratory   umhum thats true   and family the the old family structure of the mothers and the grandmothers and the grandfathers maybe even some great grandparents occasionally that seems to have been broken apart pretty pretty well including the family structure as a unit itself   yeah yeah it doesnt seem the norm to have uh have parents and and uh the two what two point five kids and all that uh   yeah well i hope thats not right i do i do hear these statistics same as you do and uh and uh i i i always felt like at least the immediate family unit mother father and children   yeah   was a cohesive structure that was healthy and was a integral part of what made this country i dont know sort of a stable country in terms of discipline uh uh i dont know some not necessary discipline but certain social order thats it and i i   true yeah but it it its sad that were were losing the grandparents and the uncles that that family you know beyond that families dont seem to get close anymore   yeah yeah yeah   and thats probably got something to do with what youre saying about the migratory   yeah in my my family i know most of us are Southerners just happen to be living up in Maryland though but my family uh were we sort of like our roots and like to get back and have family reunions and all that   yeah yeah yeah   and i think that may not be the norm for some a lot of people as much as it is for us that dont want to do that   i i think youre right i i think thats uh very rare anymore that uh definitely people arent at family reunions on a regular basis and uh and a lot of them i guess dont do it at all so   yeah yeah   because i know its been a long long time since our family ever did anything like that so   yeah i must say too it seems like the whole flavor of uh war has changed considerably when you look at back at the Vietnam era   thats true   and what all we went through there in terms of whats happened in the Iraqi situation it seems like uh we have uh made uh uh uh a a rather uh major about face in terms of the way we conduct war and the way we we uh can technologically uh uh carry out a war   umhum its its its easier to to fight i guess when you can find them  i remember that was the the problem back then you just couldnt find them     theyre a little hard to hide in that desert   yeah i mean uh not not   well uh then too i think the philosophy is changed i was just reading tonight in the one of the news magazines that you can take you know i i i take Newsweek Time and US News and World World Report all three as a matter of fact   uhhuh   and uh i was just reading in one of the uh the those news magazines that uh theres a um a movement among certain members of the military establishment the upper hierarchy uh uh uh officer staff to uh change the kind of way we conducted war in the past in terms of uh instead of meeting the enemy the enemy sort of head on instead of doing more feinting and and and and technologically appropriate tactics like these smart bombs and things like that doing more   umhum   more smart things that are very damaging getting in getting out uh making end runs allowing more creativity at the lower echelon levels for people to slip in slip out and do things   umhum   than uh has been the case in the past where the idea was to meet your enemy sort of head on and the like and i think politically weve changed a lot i think in the Vietnam war   umhum overpower them   uh we we Congress got too much involved in in trying to manage the war   well its probably because it lasted so long you know i guess its   yeah and that thats absolutely the wrong way to to go to conduct a war in my opinion when you when youre in a war right or wrong you should let the military establishment handle it and and and give them the job that theyre paid and supposedly skilled at doing   yeah umhum   and let them get on with it instead of tying their hands which i felt like was not the case in the Vietnam war but was entirely the opposite in the case of the Iraqi war where they more or less gave it to Schwartzkopf and and the rest of the military units and just says hey look handle it and they did   umhum yeah   and i think the military proved itself competent to do exactly what its paid to do and uh it just goes to give me a a a feeling that uh we did some things wrong   umhum   i think in the Vietnam era uh and that uh Congress should have stayed out of it much as possible   umhum   but uh that i see as a change and then industrially going back uh i i think uh uh industrially weve changed i think weve come through an era of the last thirty years or so twenty ten of a uh a a nation that was industrially oriented towards uh manufacturing type industries and i think now we seeing ourselves transitioning into a more technological electronics age where its   yeah more of a more information processing yeah   information and communication and and computers that is really our next industrial revolution and uh you know it wouldnt surprise me the least little bit if we didnt see the whole idea of manufacture of automobiles and the like except to some degree we have to keep a little bit of expertise in the house that being a base export to third world countries and you may find might find even Japan and and uh uh major powers like uh the the British and the central European economies being less and less dependent upon that kind of industry uh because its uh somewhat labor intensive even if they start robotizing it uh i i i im concerned that that would be the case instead the more uh advanced nations would tend to get more computerized more telecommunication oriented and the like and information is is getting to be uh sort of the thing   umhum   i i i think i dont know   yeah no thats true thats true over the last uh twenty years thats uh thats a definite change and its only going to only going to get worse i guess in the near future its going to be  more rapid i guess   umhum yeah i i think i i i i think were made some mistakes too for example i think the education system in this country has not really kept abreast of whats going on industrially   umhum   and uh ill give you an example i was talking about ive said for years because i i my backgrounds in physics and uh ive said for years that the education system in this country has not reacted   umhum   to what is the actual uh uh uh industrial evolutionary state of the country and by that i mean when i was going to school you got your basic sciences   umhum   and uh that was pretty much about it   yeah   and uh when i got out of school i had to sort of teach myself everything ive learned uh about computers and programming and and just you know the whole bit hardware in general relative to why you can do things with data acquisition process and the like   umhum   and uh when i was going to school you had to have mathematics if you were in engineering or science or any of the other scientific fields chemistry and biology and the like   umhum   but you never had to have computers and even to this date in colleges its not required to take computer courses if youre in in the engineering or the science fields   umhum   unless youre a computer scientist or or or someone in that area and then it is required of course because its part of the curriculum and uh just as we have to take at least a year of English in in in colleges and a year of some sort of social study   or electrical engineering probably yeah   i think that it should be required in college in a in a uh uh science curriculum i even think in liberal arts this day and time it should be required you have to have a year of some sort of computer   umhum
