                                 Wipe Out            Let other journaliststravel the world in search of scoops My story is in the kitchen and the livingroomand in the toilet In researching this piece I turned my apartment intoa paper torture facility as I compared the wiping power of  brands of papertowels six lines of facial tissues and  types of toilet paper Not all myexperiments were successful and as I mop up the spills I can only hope that mylandlady doesnt read                   Slate                           Thanks to latestage capitalism the supermarketshelves sag with scores of brands in the three main paper categories This isnot as daunting as it sounds because the market is now dominated by fourcompanies giant Procter  Gamble Bounty Charmin and Puffs and threeother products of merger mania KimberlyClark Scott Kleenex and VivaGeorgiaPacific Coronet Sparkle Angel Soft and MD and Fort James BrawnyQuilted Northern and Green Forest In picking the  contestants for thissurvey I strove to find representatives of the three price pointspremiummiddleoftheroad and genericand to give recycled and novelty products anequal opportunity to impress            All paperfacialtissues writing paper newsprintis created equal What makes sanitarywiping paper to use the wonderful cadences of marketingspeak stretchy andabsorbent is a process called creping A metal blade removes the paper as itdries from the steel cylinder on which it was formed lowering the papersdensity The premium wiping papers are also embossed which creates pockets tohold more moisture KimberlyClarks Web site boasts that On the East Coast only Kleenex Cottonelle hasbeen given a unique patented gentle texture that is designed to giveconsumers a clean fresh feeling Apparently we hardy westerners dontdeserve such luxury            P aper towels contain morefibrous pulp This increases their strength and the manufacturers usually givethem more pronounced embossing for greater soaking power Whereas little girlsand babies appear on toilet paper wrappers paper towel packages depict beefybrawny guys indicating their toughness In this category the contestantswere

Natural Value            To see if the towels really could provide theimplied strength and security I tested the ability of a single sheet to holdthe moisture produced when a damp tea bag was left on it for two minutesUnfortunately for me and my security deposit none of my towels succeeded Ididnt have any of the blue liquid ad agencies use in commercials to indicateabsorbency so I gauged the soaking power of individual sheets with tap waterAbsorbency varied little as I poured a quartercup of water onto towel aftertowel Not a single one could hold all the fluid but even the cheapest towelstayed solid as it was wrung out and used to wipe up the excess from thecounter            These tests convinced methat while paper towels cant perform miracles even the lowliestexample of the species can soak up liquid and dry your hands If yourefaced with a big messy job it might be worth spending the extra money for apremium product such as Bounty Rinse  Reuse or Kleenex Viva Job Squad butunder normal circumstances a budget recycled product such as the ones on offerfrom Natural Value or Second Nature offer good value and provide the desireddurability            I drew the line at catching a cold for thisstory and instead subjected six brands of facial tissues to a spraytest The contestants were                           Premium                        Purely Cotton

subjects survived thesoaking While absorbency did not vary the softness factor is significantthedownright decadence of the Kleenex ColdCare range makes everything else seemalmost abrasive And plythe number of layers of paper in the productisnteverything the Envision Preference Ultra is a ply premium product but itstill feels like a scouring pad after touching a virgin fiber tissue Thickertissues also keep germs off your hands which is nothing to sneeze at            Youll come to no harmif you use tissues as lavatory paper but your plumbing mightwhile thestrengthening cellulose fibers they contain are biodegradable facial tissuesdont break down as quickly as toilet tissue so flushing is not recommendedIf youre coldfree you almost certainly dont need the mattressy softness ofan ultra brand and you cant clean your spectacles with the aloedhankies            Americans are sheet scared of running out oftoilet tissue the average family stash of eight rolls doesnt even takeYK hoarding into account Scanning the supermarket shelves theres a vastprice difference between the budget brands and the premium products but arethe latter worth the extra The contestants were

Novelty Papers                        Purely Cotton            Cottonelle Moist Wipes            Blue Label            I didnt conduct anyfiendish experiments on loo paperI figured that the products purpose isspecific enough that a trial in the field would tell me all I needed to knowAll contestants went through the rotation in my bathroom For novelty value Ialso tried Cottonelle Moist Wipes which offer a fresher clean than withbathroom tissue alone The packaging promised that that Id feel cleanermore refreshed and confident but somehow using the adult equivalent of babywipes failed to enhance my selfesteem In the interests of internationalism Iimported a package of smooth Blue Label toilet paperthe medicated waxyretrowipe so beloved of government officesfrom Britain Its a harsh wipeand seems completely unsuited for contact with ones soft bits but drape asheet of it over a comb and it makes a wonderful kazoolike musicalinstrument            The latest marketing angle in toilet tissue is the doubleor triple roll There doesnt appear to be any agreement on what constitutes astandard rollsocalled double rolls measure anywhere from  square feet to square feet and the Charmin triple roll is a giant  square feet thoughwere assured it fits almost all standard dispensers The implied economiesdont pan outin my local supermarket the perfectly adequate singleroll storebrand Heritage Hearth was considerably cheaper per square foot than any ofthe double or triple rolls only half the price of the most expensive premiumbrand I tried Kleenex Cottonelle Ultrasoft Double Roll and it doesnt takeup as much room in my YK storeroom            Recycled toilet tissueshave improved since the sandpaperlike sheets of the early s but they justcant compete on the softness front The recycled ingredients include roughstuff like cardboard boxes as well as office paper Still the case forrecycling is persuasive The packaging for Seventh Generation toilet paperclaims that if every household in the US replaced just one roll of sheet virgin fiber bathroom tissues with  recycled ones we could save trees  million cubic feet of landfill space equal to  fullgarbage trucks  million gallons of water a years supply for families of four Since most Americans get through  to  rolls of TP peryear thats a lot of trees trash and water            The mainstream brands base their sales pitches ondescriptors such as gentle plush and cottony softness but althoughnames such as Cottonelle trade on the image of cotton the products arewoodbased whereas one relative newcomer to the market is actually made fromthe fluffy plant Purely Cotton bathroom and facial tissues are made fromcotton linterwhats left over when fibers and cottonseed oil have beenharvested As a byproduct cotton linter is considered  percentrecycledrecovered and although it is bleached to make it snowy white theprocess doesnt produce dioxins as with wood pulp bleaching            After my experiments Ill probably stick withPurely Cotton which costs no more than the premium brands is environmentallysound acceptably soft and appropriately absorbent Even the cheapest toiletpaper gets the job done so if you want to impress guests or if you dont wantto keep paper hankies in the bathroom buy the expensive stuff but Ill betyour delicate bits wont notice the difference
