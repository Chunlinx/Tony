scene of increased Serb brutality againstthe Albanian Kosovars A report from Pristina in the Daily Telegraph of London gavean account of the brutal removal from their home of Kosovos leading humanrights lawyer Bayram Kelmendi and his son Kastriot who was told before beingtaken away to kiss his children for the last time because he would never seethem again On President Slobodan Milosevics decision to expel Westernjournalists and TV crews from the region La Repubblica noted thatneither Adolf Hitler nor Saddam Hussein had done that            As Milosevics resistance continued alarm grew in theWestern press over the apparent lack of clear war aims and the growing fearthat NATO will not succeed in restoring peace to Yugoslavia without committingground troops In Canada the Toronto Globe and Mail saidin a nervous editorial Thursday that by ruling out in advance the commitmentof ground troops before a negotiated peace agreement NATO told Milosevic thatits undertaking to protect Kosovo went only so farnot exactly the kind ofmessage to send to an adversary as you go to war Milosevic by his bestialbehavior had courted the disaster now befalling his country the paper saidbut it added The world is full of beasts It is also full of oppressedminorities struggling to be free Which beasts do we bomb Which minorities dowe champion When do we charge to the rescue and when do we shrug and lookaway What are the rules of the game After yesterday nobody knows            In France Libration said in an editorial Friday that themissile attacks far from frightening the great ethnic purifier of theBalkans had made him look almost in the right The Kosovars would not besaved the editorial addedMilosevic will sooner or later return to thenegotiating table but that will without doubt be only to effect the partitionof Kosovo LeFigaro also envisaged the partition of Kosovo as the undesired outcomeof the war with Albania getting the inhospitable mountains and Serbia thefertile plain and it blamed Europe for letting Washington call the shots byfailing to take responsibility for its own security History has shown thatmilitary campaigns are only successful if their aims are defined beforehandLe Figaro said comparing Bill Clinton to a little boy who whistles inthe dark to reassure himself            In Spain El Mundo called for apolitical solution saying that if the bombing goes on for long the alliancewill become increasingly divided In Britain the Daily Telegraphproposed that Kosovar independence be made a declared goal of policyafterthree years if Mr Milosevic complies with Rambouillet sooner if he doesnot the Independent said that the United Nations had already agreedto the objective of the warto protect the human rights of the AlbanianKosovarsand that NATO should not balk at the prospect of a long campaign toachieve it and the Times urged the expedition of an International Monetary Fundloan to Russia to keep the country sweet            Despite feelings of solidarity with Kosovos MuslimAlbanian majority Arab newspapers were generally gloomy and apprehensiveThursday about the NATO offensive They feared it could fatally damage theauthority of the United Nations and lead to a resumption of the Cold War whilebenefiting Saddam Hussein and weakening NATO by setting Greece and Turkeyagainst each other In the PanArab daily alHayat  AbdelwahhabBadrakkhan wrote that the United States by abrogating to itself the right todecide on the use of military force had effectively delegitimized the UnitedNations He called for a new international agreement of the kind that replacedthe League of Nations with the United Nations for it was unacceptable that theUnited Nations should become merely a building where people go to complain orengage in Byzantine debates over texts that everyone knows the big powers willbe the first to treat with contempt            In the leading Saudidaily Asharq alAwsat  Huda alHusseini said the bombing reflected theClinton administrations growing penchant for military solutions as asubstitute for considered plans to impose peace and protect people frommassacres The writer expressed concern over the precedent it set for NATOmilitary intervention in the internal conflicts of any state If tensionsbetween Washington and Beijing grow in the future what is there to prevent theformer raising the Tibet issue and threatening intervention there she wroteAnd if the aim of the intervention is to protect oppressed minorities whypeople ask doesnt NATO intervene in Turkey whose human rights recordvisavis the Kurds is as bad as it can be            Selectivity in approaching issues of human rights andselfdetermination is a longstanding American trait alHusseini said addingthat its resolve in Kosovo perhaps has more to do with upholding thecredibility of NATO as its  th anniversary approaches and toensure that Washingtons leadership of the alliance does not appear weak Butshe went on the airstrikes could not only provoke Serbian retaliation againstNATO forces in Bosnia but trigger ethnic conflict in Macedonia which has alarge ethnic Albanian majority and a Balkan explosion would severely weakenNATO            The PanArab alQuds alArabi said that if the Americans get boggeddown in the Balkan conflict as is likely to happen this will benefit Iraqthe other country on the receiving end of US military action It alsodescribed the bombing as a step toward initiating a new modified Cold War andsaid that Kosovo could turn into a latterday version of Afghanistan or evenVietnam for the United States and its allies
