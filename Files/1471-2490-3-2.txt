                    Background        The application of UHCT for the diagnosis of acute        ureteric colic has positively influenced the practice of        urology and uroradiology The technology allows the rapid        and accurate determination of the presence of stone in the        urinary tract Since the pioneering study on the role of        UHCT in the evaluation of ureteric colic by Smith et al           in  a number of studies have shown the superiority        of noncontrast enhanced CT over IVU and Ultrasonography               Its sensitivity and specificity is reported to        be more than  and   respectively          An        important disadvantage is a higher radiation dose to the        patient     Denton    noted a difference of  mSv        versus  mSv in the radiation dose to the patient between        IVU and UHCT performed for renal colic        Advantages of UHCT includes rapid scan time avoidance        of contrast related hazards cost effectiveness high        accuracy and its ability to suggest an alternative        diagnosis for flank pain This last characteristic of UHCT        is valuable in diagnosing many significant diseases earlier        in their course which may be helpful in decreasing the        associated morbidity In this study we are presenting our        initial experience of diagnosing alternative or additional        diseases on UHCT performed for the evaluation of acute        flank pain                    Methods        The radiologists reports on CT CT films and medical        records of  consecutive patients performed between July         and August  at a University Hospital for suspected        renalureteral colic were reviewed The UHCT were obtained        on a Ctipro single slice helical CT scanner General        Electrical medical systems Milwaukee WI The exposure        factors setting were KVp  and mAS  All scans        were obtained from the upper border of T vertebral body        to the lower border of symphysis pubis using  mm        collimation without the use of oral or intravenous        contrast material Patients were placed in supine position        with full urinary bladder at the time of the UHCT        Additional prone films were taken whenever the radiologist        needed a better description of suspected distal ureteric        calculi Radiological diagnoses of clinical entities        otherwise suspected were analyzed All relevant        radiological biochemical serological investigations as        well as peroperative findings were also analyzed                    Results        From July   to August    patients had        UHCT for the evaluation of acute flank pain Ureteral        calculi were identified in  examinations  findings        of recent passage of calculi in   and no calculus in          scans Thirtytwo of the conservatively managed        patients were lost to follow up and therefore were not        included In the remaining  patients sensitivity and        specificity of UHCT in diagnosing calculi was  and         respectively while ve and ve predictive value was  and         respectively Twentyeight patients  had        alternative or additional diseases other than renal        ureteric or bladder stone disease diagnosed on UHCT        Table describes in detail the alternative or additional        diagnoses        In   of these cases diagnosis was confirmed by the        surgical procedure biopsy and biochemical evaluation in        case of pancreatitis as shown in Table                     Discussion        A wide variety of significant or potentially significant        diagnoses can be identified on UHCT performed for suspected        ureteralrenal colic         Apart from its        high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing stone        disease the characteristic of UHCT which discriminates it        from other modalities is its ability to pick up other        unsuspected significant clinical entities Early diagnosis        of diseases such as appendicitis cholecystitis        pancreatitis diverticulitis and leaking aortic aneurysm        that require urgent and prompt treatment could affect the        associated morbidity and mortality associated with such        diseases In a large series of  UHCT for suspected        renalureteric colic Katz    reported  patients         with alternative or incidental diagnosis        Table shows some of the major series published to date        on this subject        Among the major series published on the subject                the incidence of unsuspected clinical entities        was  The disease pattern is remarkably similar in        most series Table  In one report from Albert Einstein        Medical Center Philadelphia Marcella et al    noted an        unusually high incidence of incidentally discovered renal        cell cancer There is low incidence of diverticulitis in        South Asia and we have found no case of diverticulitis in        our series by comparison to other series It is important        that in the absence of ureterolithiasis particular care        should be taken to rule out alternative diagnosis for flank        pain        In our series early diagnosis of pancreatitis        cholecystitis mesenteric lymphadenitis pyelonephritis and        appendicitis initiated early treatment The alternative        diagnosis of eight tumors in our series and similar trends        in other series is interesting It suggests that UHCT may        change the prognosis in many cases that would otherwise be        diagnosed late                    Conclusion        A wide variety of significant alternative or additional        diagnoses can be reliably identified on UHCT performed for        suspected renalureteric colic In the present series such        diseases were diagnosed in  of cases Unlike most series        from the West we did not note any case of        diverticulitis
