                were supposed to talk about dining what kind of dining do you like to do   well were in the Dallas area are you also   uhhuh yeah grapevine yeah yeah im in Grapevine uh Fort Worth Dallas area   pardon uhhuh well we uh we dont do a lot of family dining out uh but but my husband and i do     uhhuh   we do all kinds of different things so was that you   yes can you believe that   oh okay well i just didnt know if i needed to go and whoop up on my kids quick or       whatever   no i just let it go   oh okay   uh itll theyll call back   well the uh my husband and i used to try to go out like one evening of a weekend or something   uhhuh   and sometimes well even go during the daytime for lunch   oh thats nice   so if we have the opportunity just because its quieter   yeah yeah   we dont like the bar atmosphere   yeah they usually stick you in there for an hour you know or even when there are plenty of tables that always makes me mad that just to get you to buy drinks i guess and   uhhuh now   i dont mind waiting thirty minutes but boy if it gets over thirty minutes it really irritates me   yeah and we arent drinkers so you know for us thats just kind of wasted time time we just but now we do go to this one little place out here on the expressway uh Cheddars   yeah uhhuh yeah i   and they have a uh   i ate there Friday as a matter of fact at lunch   umhum umhum well they have a big screen TV   yeah in Dallas the one in Fort Worth oh okay   in their bar area lounge area and we dont mind that because we both love basketball and like to watch basketball   uhhuh   but i uh oh i dont like the fights and stuff and sometimes you see those   yeah     but and if if its a wild and crazy music that turns us off too   me too me too   but we uh   yeah i like uh theres not too many restaurants i dont like to go to i  just i just like to eat out but i uh     we do too we we do too i i wish we could do more often i imagine when all our kids get gone and grown that well   yeah you will mine are mine are grown and gone in fact im going over tonight to my sons house hes taking me out tonight for Mothers Day and then my im going to brunch in the morning with my daughter for Mothers for Mothers Day uh so     how fun how fun   ill have  of course im on a diet but i guess ill go off of it for this weekend     well dont you think though there are a lot more options available for people who are watching   yeah and you know you   you know youre seeing a lot more grilled chicken and fish without breading on it and   right yeah absolutely and thats   you know i never hesitate ever anymore to ask for my dressing on the side or to eliminate sour cream or anything like that and theyre always willing to help and accommodate   yeah yeah they are and i really even all the fast foods theyre coming out with the grilled chicken and i eat a lot of those you know and even if i   yeah yeah   i i dont eat steak too much i love steak and i have to have it every  every now and then but normally im i i try and stay away from the red the red meats if i go to a steak house i will eat one but i dont you know gorge myself   yeah yeah i love steak too and you know a lot of times well our favorite place to eat for steak is Steak and Ale   it yeah now ive never gotten a bad meal there have you i just you know theyre consistently good   humum no no and just always you know always quiet and pleasant and   yeah theyre uh i i found that if you call and make reservations oh i uh you they used to irritate me making us wait so long but uh now i found if i call and make reservations they usually get you in pretty fast so   umhum umhum oh the uh uh one out here is just always very accommodating you know we like a lot of ethnic foods too we we like to go different places and   uhhuh i do too well i love Chinese i love oriental food and i love seafood and uh but i also like i i dont mind paying for atmosphere   yep yeah i dont either   i i it doesnt bother me at all and uh if i and i dont and im not opposed to tipping very well if i if the service is good but boy i it really irritates me to well like in Cheddars yesterday i know that the girl just forgot our order and we were on a lunch hour you know and my gosh she just   you waiting and waiting and waiting   and i know i thought gosh my whole lunch hour im just sitting here waiting here for a lousy sandwich so i went ahead and tipped her but i didnt want to       was mad   yeah and you know that thats part of their wage and that they get busy and stuff you but but you wouldnt tip as much as you would have had   yes i know it right yeah right but that that and i do i tip accordingly oh believe me i if the   you know the uh i do too i think that thats service related and you know   i do too but i hate cheap people that that get good service and dont tip that irritates me just as bad and ive been out with guys that have embarrassed me that dont tip   yeah yeah   you know well i  it really uh   makes you want to just kind of slip a little more under there   yeah it really and i have i have slipped money you know if if the guy didnt tip enough ill take money out of my purse but a   yeah yeah   and i hope it makes them feel bad but i dont think it does   no probably not they figure i guess they figure thats your choice well uh i know uh my i have teenagers and just recently i was out with a group of teenagers for semester exams   uhhuh   uh if i said i would provide transportation at lunchtime for them to go and out to eat and   uhhuh   so all these little kids here they all want their own tickets you know   yeah   and i said right up front now kids actually i kind of said it to my daughter and if i was going to do it again i would say it to the whole group because i was too uh i was i was too shy i didnt not too shy i just didnt want to embarrass her   okay uhhuh   but what happened was i ended up having to loan money to those kids because they did not figure in the tip and the tax   oh did you really umhum umhum   they looked at that and said three ninety five they say i got four dollars i can do this   and they thought that really yeah yeah   you know so they buy the get the three ninety five item and you know then they didnt have enough for the extra so   and i found the also that uh i dont think that waitresses i yeah i was in a survey when i lived in Orlando uh had a was in a survey of restaurants and uh the i a lot of the waiters and waitresses think you know when women come in that that women are lousy tippers and thats why they dont give them as good a service as they do a couple or something like that but i dont think thats true i think women   just that you know a single woman an individual of any kind is not going to have as large an order   to me right   as two or three at a table   well i find that women are more willing to give a good tip a bunch of women as   sure   uh couples or or you know  guys together probably   yeah   i dont think theyre that but that they were on this survey they were saying that the thats the notion that women have i mean that waitress and waitresses had but uh   well i i yeah i definitely disagree with that   i like one of my favorites in Dallas is uh Baby Does you have you ever eaten there   umhum been a long time been a long time   oh yeah i love it oh gosh its i like the atmosphere i remember when they first opened up i we went several times and uh it was it was so much fun but i like i said i like to go to restaurants like that i and i like these um have you ever been to what when i lived in Orlando they had call a place called Shakespeares and they probably have one similar to it here where medieval   umhum uhhuh the medieval   yeah those are kind of fun i wouldnt want a steady diet of it but   kind of uh a tavern pub kind of thing   yeah and have the wenches wait on you   umhum   it was a lot of fun i i enjoyed that   we uh we were at the butcher shop in the West End here recently and that was sure neat it cook your own steak and those steaks were wonderful   uhhuh yeah where you cook your own steak yeah yeah yeah werent they i ive eaten there that was thats good but   it was uh i really enjoyed that   i remember back when that was just old warehouses down there i couldnt believe when i moved back to Dallas how that had changed   yeah exactly exactly same here i grew up in the area   yeah i remember i think Spaghetti Warehouse was about the only thing down there for years and years   some of my favorite ones have   i guess it kind of grew around it   well   i moved from in eighty five when i came back all that was uh built back up   had all been worked over   yeah and i thought you know Deep Ellum i still dont think id go to Deep Ellum i dont care how chic its supposed to be but   well theres some wonderful little shops and art   art galleries and   is it really i just could i just from       back in the fifties i remember how bad it was and i just it just stuck in my mind and i just wouldnt go down there i dont think especially at night i might during the day but i dont think id go at night down there at all because it used to really be rough and tough in fact the only time i ever saw anybody stabbed out we were driving down in the street and saw a guy come out of a theater with a knife sticking out of his back and that just is stuck in my mind and he was walking too uh they were walking him to an ambulance   ooh   and i just ive never gone back since then   that was enough to take it   no  thats right i dont want to go down there anymore   well i think thats those kind of things definitely tend to mark your uh   yeah but Dallas has really got a lot of good restaurants   they really do i think Dallas is a very uh up and coming area i think its uh   yeah they just   it it caters to a lot of business groups and a lot of out of towners and and regulars also and you know   uhhuh yeah are you a native Dallasite   uh i came here when i was in elementary school so i consider myself native   okay well i married a Dallasite and thats how i got here but i would you know i wouldnt trade for it i im from California but i i just consider myself a Texan when i moved to Florida i couldnt hardly wait to get back   well   i stayed down there four years   i think uh you know that uh i think Dallas is becoming diverse enough now to accommodate almost any need   yeah i think so   or any desires in any kind of cooking you know Indian Greek you name it you know theres theres something for everybody and   yeah umhum umhum im enjoying living over here in Grapevine and Fort Worth area too for for a change because im really discovering Fort Worth theyve got a lot of nice restaurants over here that a lot of people dont know about you know   our favorite one in Fort Worth is downtown Fort Worth kind of across from the uh The Keg   The Keg is it down there by Sundance Square   The Keg well its down you know by the Convention Center   yeah i  i   i dont know what the street is   im not real familiar with down there ive been down there to the Sundance Square when i first uh moved back here i met my sisterinlaw sisterinlaw down there and uh
