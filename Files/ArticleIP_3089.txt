                                 Girlie Men            Everybody knows that Parisis the realm of fashion fashion is the realm of artifice and both are therealm of women This year as always Paris fashion has meant fabulouslookinggirls slinking along in foothigh hair or plasteredflat hair with grim orgiddy hats and stark painted faces sporting fitted tops transparent topscutout tops tight skirts slit to here full skirts trailing to there floppypants or skinny pants trimmings that glitter or flutter colors that dazzle orpuzzle curled feathers and dyed fur boiled wool and frosted leather crushedvelvet shot silk frayed hemp and distressed plastic Such displays are to beexpected in Paris as part of the traditional French insistence that Eve hasthe right to cut and shape her fig leaf edge it with spangled lace andlacquer it black If you want Adams fig leaf in its natural material go toLondon            Or so legend has itBritish understatement set the universal standard for male elegance in and its holding its own two centuries later When Beau Brummell said If younoticed me I wasnt welldressed he put an end to purple feathers andcrimson velvet for men all over the Western world and that was that rightdown to all the Similar Sober Suits at summit meetings            Butmen apparently are getting tired of being inconspicuous With no loss ofbeauty and status mens suits are just as becoming as they ever were perfectmale tailoring has lost some of its virile edge No wonder since the strongesttheme in modern womens fashion has been the creative theft of the malewardrobe with all its components translated into terms of conspicuousseduction How can mens fashion respond to this            Paris has the answer Just take it back and take itfurther Paris todayand Milan and New York always hoping to outdo Parisisoffering mens fashion shows of unexpected glamour color and sexualityfounding a new theater that could someday rival its feminine equivalentapplying Eves method to Adam In the this years fall collections designersfor men were using the same trousers and shorts shirts and sweaters coats andjackets that women had already rescued from British decorum and boldlydistorted for themselves The menswear shows deployed a similarsuggestivenessa formfitting shape a brazen inventiveness of texture andhue a daring sweep of cuff collar and coattail all totally forbidden bySaville Row but gloriously worked up for women during the last  years by thelikes of Yves Saint Laurent            Heretheres a fur scarf or some extra drapery added to the neck of a mans suitthere theres a mans raincoat in metallic fabric that moves in a millionglittering folds Theres a mans svelte blazer tailored in a redfloweredivory brocade There are also references to  th century piratesArabian                Nights sultans Regency bucks findesicledandies and depraved noblemen of the ancien rgime                            I tsexhilarating to see this stuff back on men and not just in the movies Themodels look magnificent especially the ones working for Vivienne Westwood andJeanPaul Gaultier who have joyfully reveled in creating extreme artifice forboth sexes Gaultiers male models wear full makeup and pencil mustaches withtheir finery and they smolder with conviction The ones from Masaki Matsushimaeven smolder in silvery  th century wigs and one Moschino modelwore a blue Louis XV wig with a blue denim ensemble his face a charming studyin irony Yohji Yamamoto uses tragicfaced models some bald middleaged andnot so slim on whom his quasiMiddle Eastern robes coats and headgear looknearly noble Many comely youths on the other hand look much like Shelleysportrait with flowing locks and tender throats exposed above their soft suedesuits            Thewhole display vividly depicts what men have envied for so long Forgenerations they had to look tough modest honest and restrained under plainsuits or plain sportswear Masculinity was allowed no erotic range in dressthe phallic necktie licensed to reflect light and glow with color wasfamously mens only hope Every expressive shape or shiny streak in a coat andsuit bore the dread suggestion of effeminacy connoting both a lack ofintegrity and an unbridled vanity felt to be unavoidable in women butcriminal even thuggish in men And so the free play of fantasy died out ofmens clothes Revived fantasy has tended in one direction only which meansthat lately theres been more than enough black leather harsh metal andshaved hair Maybe now that sexual ambiguity is recognized as a potent forcewe can begin to see men in gold embroidery and sweeping folds of silk            Long habits die hard though Most mens fashion showsstill concentrate on exquisite variations of the formal and sporty classicswith plenty of subtle colors beautiful cravats and very discreet historicalreferences Male models still cant carry off the gaudy stuff They lurchuncomfortably along the catwalk imprisoned in a tradition of artlessnessSkirts show no sign of appearing on the man in the street although Gaultierhas been promoting them for years His most recent catwalk version was a sariwrapped around the waist under a jacket falling to the instep and swingingwith the wearers manly stride Very nice but not likely to catch on until menfinally remember the comfortable tunics of the very distant past            Men have already recoveredthe masculine long hair jewelry and purses of medieval times Skirts mayappear some day thats a prediction but probably with a military flavor thekind built into the Scottish kilt or the battle dress of Roman soldiersMeanwhile lovers of spectacle will have to content themselves with drag whichgives intermittent delight to its watchers and wearers even if so far ithasnt made an appearance at summit meetings
