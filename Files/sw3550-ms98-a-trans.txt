                 okay go ahead   all right well what kind of car would i wanna buy i dont know   yeah   the question is i mean would i want to buy or would i would i probably actually buy may be two different things   oh well if you if you had all your all the money in the world or something i dont   if i had all the money i wanted then thats whole different matter yeah uh   yeah   no the car in in that case id id i dont know i i my dream car for years was a was a Porsche Turbo Carrera   uhhuh uhhuh   but uh i dont know if id want one of those now well i of course i would want one if somebody was was giving it to me but i maybe would buy a BMW   oh really well uhhuh   um or or even a Volvo   what do you have now   ive got a a uh a Dodge Daytona   umhum  hm   its actually the first car we ever bought new and everything   oh really yeah we just we well i have my car is the first one we ever bought new too but we just bought another used car a couple weeks ago actually   uhhuh what uhhuh me yeah me too  so so what car do you drive what is it     um mine is a Honda Accord and   uhhuh we almost bought one of those do you like it   yeah i do and and um its funny because after i bought it i was doing a lot of business traveling and i some of the cars that i got were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors   umhum umhum   and um i didnt like them as well except it wasnt really fair comparison because those were automatics and mine is a standard and the reason i got a standard was because i thought it handled a lot better it had a lot more pickup and everything   yeah yeah uhhuh yeah yeah you get a little more control over when it when its doing the things its doing yeah um  so what what rental agency did you go to to actually rent to to rent those kind of cars   uhhuh um usually Avis   to what Avis really   Avis yeah yeah   huh i guess   well its just because were on uh i think of it im not sure if those are Avis or not but we have corporate contracts   i see   you know with the various companies so it depends on your destination too its kind of strange   uhhuh right you work for a big company then   work for TI umhum which is how i heard about this   TI i uhhuh um but  yeah i i uh i dont know i i would probably if i were to buy a car myself you know and with the constraints of the real of the of real money i probably would would   umhum   go with something like you you know like the Honda Accord maybe it would it one thing i i really liked about about the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have uh um  this seven year warranty   umhum oh really   um and it really saved us some big money once   it did wow   yeah they had a whole bunch of things that that sort of broke at the same time   oh my gosh   and uh the bill wouldve been over fifteen hundred dollars and i had to pay twenty five for the   oh that is great thats unusual to hear usually you know if something breaks you look at the warranty and its excluded   yeah well the well we we bought the extended the the extension   oh i see okay   and uh at the time we bought it it was like you know it was i dont know four hundred and twenty five dollars or something extra   oh well you got your moneys worth   yeah we did but you know we really debated at the beginning and of of course im glad i did it   yeah yeah that is good   but um we still have we still have like you know couple three years left on it   yeah well ive been lucky mine hasnt had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it   yeah oh no   but i was real lucky because it just hit the um the lens to the light it didnt actually dent the car or anything so it cost me twenty five bucks to replace that   bumper oh well thats good are   and the store will pay for it anyway so   uhhuh   no big deal   um if you were if you were going to uh buy a new car would you buy another uh another Accord   um i probably wouldnt just because we already have one   umhum   but you know if i had to make the choice again i yeah id im perfectly happy with what i decided um although we did just buy another car and thats a Legend um but its its a used one   uhhuh oh yeah those are nice and uhhuh   and um my husband has really wanted one for a long time and the fact that you know this car this car that i have has performed so well and before that i also had an Accord it was a real old one   umhum   and um i bought that used i had absolutely no money to my name and bought that and it served me real well too so hes been impressed with all the Honda cars   hm right   and   yeah my sister drives one she drives a uh um i dont know is it Legend its uh   umhum   oh im not certain though  but shes liked it um   yeah   but i i have i have never had and we  in fact what im driving right now we bought a we only had one car for a long time and   umhum   and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth you know from four miles to work and back kind of thing     uhhuh   and so uh i bought a used Yugo just to be a little you know a little car that i could care less about just waste yeah   uhhuh yeah how did it go for you   oh well its uh its worked you know it i mean its exactly what it is you know its just a its a cheap lit tle you know little car just to go you know running run around town in and uh   hasnt left you stranded yeah i know yeah   its actually kind of fun to drive i i i you know getting back in the Daytona now i almost dont like it you know its just like too too mushy and it you know its its an automatic and the   really huh well thats what my husband thinks about my car now that hes had the Legend its wimpy   its too its the steering is just you know you feel like youre in a boat or something you know its kind of   i cant drive that the Legend its just so huge i i dont like it and its so uh   oh
