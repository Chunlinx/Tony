        im Nevin from Sunnyvale California     hi this is Jim Bliss from Minneapolis Minnesota how you doing   pretty good   good um i guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how how we would change it um im ready whenever you are   yep hum okay     so uh what are your what are your thoughts on the subject there   well i definitely think like decisions have to be unanimous   yeah yeah i think thats probably a a good thing   its probably the safest thing   yeah i mean its to to easy to get a quorum and simple majority wont do   yep i no and even even like you know two thirds majority i mean   yeah thats yeah quorums are to easy to get and theres always that that chance that one or two people could be playing devils advocate for a good reason you know so its its yeah definitely     yep   yeah   but um i dont know it i could i couldnt believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing   yeah like gives gives them a little too much power   yeah  that i i know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that or arguing against that pretty vehemently but um     plus you know you may be you know doing a you know a a guilty verdict but it may not be you know may be for technical reasons   yeah about the only good thing i would see about that is that would it that it would um hurry the process up a bit   yeah   but i mean even now weve got i know weve got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that   i know what i   and thats what the trial by jury i mean jeez if it if the judge was doing it himself without any checks and balances   yeah it to be thered be much more of that   whose to say yeah no doubt       are you involved in the legal system at all   no but i tend i tend to follow it just to   okay   just to know whats going on   yeah yeah ive got some friends that are lawyers so   yeah i do too so   one of them just got his law degree but um to tell you the truth im not real familiar with um the system of jurisprudence jurisprudence the way it is right now i really havent studied it in depth   no yeah i know a little more about civil cases when than criminal cases which is  its more in how you present it versus you know whos right   yeah im sure of it because a lot of those things its all its in its largely a matter of viewpoint and who can argue their case better   yep     um its kind of weird i dont know yeah i always think about watching the Peoples Court or something       and how weird those cases get   i know   its just   when i was uh couple of years ago involved in some pretrial stuff and like you know you go say okay we cant bring up this point because then theyre gonna you know the opposition will say this this and this and   yeah umhum and its like boy the stuff that they can twist around is its pretty amazing     yep and its like the the truth really isnt important anymore its   yeah its not       and then you get people who who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because like this this friend of mines pretty obnoxious and he really gets into suing people   yep     and so hell hell sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court and argue his case       you know its like   that sounds like a little abuse of our system but   it is its its wasting peoples time and the taxpayers money and everything else but uh   yeah but its for the more general people dont want to take responsibility   yeah   you know thats a   and uh and and most of the time theyre looking to place blame um   yep   and stuff see youre from California is that right   uh yeah well originally Chicago but   hum oh okay i was just thinking i wonder i wonder how how the civil system or the the court systems differ between there and say where i am in Minneapolis i mean from what i understand its all pretty much the same except when you get to Louisiana   i i really     and Louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the what is it its based on common law and the rest of the country is not or something like that its pretty strange   oh yeah   but uh fortunately i never have had to go in even even for jury duty   yeah i havent either other than   but um that friend of mines telling me that i might have to go in for uh as a witness he may subpoena me       so well see what happens but uh   yeah im not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better i   yeah its there are too many big problems you know theres theres such a backlog of court cases right now   i know   you know to try to get them all in in a good time and we already have too many lawyers as it is   yeah and if its criminal cases we you cant put them in jail because theres no room left   yeah yeah thats true and in fact theyre even letting some go im im originally im originally from Florida and its like it seems like every year they let out more and more just because they dont have room for them   yeah um   you know thats not a thats not a good solution either   not at all   so im not real sure what to
