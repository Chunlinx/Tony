                                  The War on Video Crack            Americans who dont gamble tend to view gambling aseither highglitz casinos or megabucks lotteriesthe only outlets the mediaever bother to notice This narrow focus has protected the gambling industrysince Americans are willing to accept a vice that is clearly separated from therest of societyas casinos areor that offers a luscious chance at the goodlifeas megabucks lotteries do            But three nascentgrassroots antigambling campaigns in the West could finally bring attention tothe real issue in American gambling which has nothing whatsoever to do withcasinos or multimilliondollar jackpots In Oregon and South Dakota votershave gathered enough signatures to place a constitutional amendment on theNovember  ballot to outlaw video lottery In Montana activists arepreparing a similar November  ballot measure to abolish video gambling inthat state These initiatives arent trying to eliminate all legal gambling intheir statesprohibition has been a disastrously unsuccessful strategy in thegambling wars Instead they are targeting only the newest and most addictiveform of American betting convenience gambling The campaigns againstconvenience gambling mark the most important development in gambling politicsin years            Convenience gamblinga cheerful phrase for an alarmingideais premised on the notion that once gambling is legal it should beallowed just about everywhere convenience stores bars restaurants bowlingalleys gas stations Eight states permit convenience gambling now In severalincluding South Dakota and Oregon convenience gambling takes the form of asocalled video lottery To those who havent played it video lotterysounds like some kind of hightech Powerballa lottery played with a computerinstead of a ticket In fact video lottery bears no relationship at all to alottery It is simply a euphemism for staterun video poker machines Videopoker is a popular casino game a lowstakes electronic version offivecarddraw poker It means minicasinos on Main Street that are run by thegovernment says Tom Grey head of the National Coalition Against LegalizedGambling which is organizing the three ballot initiatives Oregon with about million residents owns  video poker machines that it places in businesses South Dakota with less than  million residents has gambling machines in  locations Montana has similar numbers of machinesin similar places though the state does not run the machines            These Western statesintroduced video gambling in the late s and early s for one reason It isa stupendously effective way of parting citizens from their money According tothe North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries the averageAmerican in a state with a lottery spends about  per year on the lotteryBut in the five states with video lotteries Delaware West Virginia and RhodeIsland along with South Dakota and Oregon average per capita lotteryspending is about  per year In South Dakota where lottery play is thehighest in the country the average person spends an amazing  per year onthe state lottery            This generates monster revenues for both state andretailer South Dakotas government splits the revenue  with the bars andrestaurants The state clears  million a year which it is using to cutproperty taxes  percent This money represents about  percent of the totalstate budget In Oregon the state takes about twothirds of the video lotteryrevenues That amounts to more than  million a yearabout  percent of thebudgetwhich the state spends on education parks and salmon restorationWhat do Oregons public schools businesses workforce state parks andsalmon all have in common boasts the Oregon Lotterys home page They allreceive Lottery profits to help them prepare for the future In Montana thestate pockets  percent of video gambling revenue in taxes close to million for the states treasury Both Oregon and South Dakota also runtraditional lotteries but they are pennyante games next to the video lotteryOnly a quarter of Oregons lottery revenue comes from traditional lotterygames and only  percent of South Dakotas does            Video gambling deliverstax revenues but it exacts huge social costs Video poker is known as videocrack Its rate of play is dizzyingly fastI once played more than  gamesof video poker in an hourand the flashing lights and flickering screens sendplayers into trancelike reveries Unlike other kinds of gambling video pokerdiscourages social interaction The machines suck people into the screensays Professor William Thompson a gambling expert at the University of NevadaLas Vegas You dont talk or socialize You dont trade stories It isdifferent from blackjack or even handle slots These are the most addictive ofany gambling instrument we have today Its also voracious A typical gambleraddicted to blackjack takes about  years from placing the first bet tobottoming out a gambler hooked on video poker needs less than three years Thenumber of Gamblers Anonymous chapters in Oregon has leapt from three to since video poker was introduced in  The state itself recognizes thedangers of video poker It forbids video lottery advertising and allocates million a year for treating problem gamblers Whats more the small stakes invideo lotteries encourage addiction Unlike lotteries which offer low odds butspectacular jackpots video poker returns tiny but frequent pots The staterelies on people playing the games over and over and over again            Addiction is not the only drawback of video gambling It isa cinch for kids to play video lottery machines since they are often found inbusinesses that kids frequent Though it pays off more often than lotteriesvideo poker offers poor odds compared with most casino gambling taking about cents of every dollar bet compared to  cents for casino slots Moreoverconvenience gambling doesnt deliver the secondary economic benefits that biggambling can Because states limit the number of machines that any one businesscan have there are no large casinos So video lottery brings none of theancillary jobs restaurants and hotels that big casinos do            As a result conveniencegambling is emerging as the kind of gambling that everyone can dislike a juicytarget for opponents and a scapegoat for supporters of more acceptable kinds ofwagering A bipartisan grassroots campaign in South Carolina just eliminatedits enormous video poker industry Read about that abolition  This summerhalf the parishes in Louisiana threw out video gambling from their barsrestaurants and truck stops Several years ago the mayor of Las Vegas whostrongly supported casinos tried to root out convenience gambling from storesin her city The rest of the gambling industry treats convenience gambling likean embarrassing cousin routinely condemning it            South Dakota and Oregon have preserved a last best argumentagainst the critics They cant afford to drop video lotteries Governors inboth states have said they dislike relying on lottery revenues to fundessential government services The governor has never been a big fan of thelottery and of letting gambling policy drive public policy says a spokesmanfor Oregons Gov John Kitzhaber But they are too scared of losing their videolottery funds to endorse the ballot initiatives When the Oregon ballotinitiative was floated earlier this year Kitzhaber endorsed the idea ofabolishing the video lottery but said the state needed a phaseout period tofind replacement revenue So the activists added a threeyear phaseout to theirballot initiative Kitzhaber now insists on a phaseout of at least six yearsHe wants to get rid of it but then he wants six years He sounds like anaddict says the antigambling coalitions Grey            The Oregon and South Dakota votes are a year awayand the Montana signaturegathering has not yet begun No one knows whethereven one of the initiatives can pass The lottery retailers will surely spendmillions to keep their cash cow and the governors are likely to campaign forvideo gambling as well But if the initiatives do squeak by they may signal anew and encouraging compromise a recognition that just because gambling islegal does not mean it has to be everywhere If the initiatives pass afterall the states will retain their traditional scratchoff and Powerballlotteries and their Indian casinos will continue to offer electronic gamblingon reservations These states will have gambling that is accessible but notuniversal gambling that funds state government but does not hold ithostage
