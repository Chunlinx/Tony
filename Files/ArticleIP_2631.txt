                                 All in the Jeans            Let me tell you a storyabout jeans Actually let me tell you a story about two companies that selljeans One of them Levi Strauss is about the best that American capitalismhas to offer both in terms of ethical business practices and the way it treatsits workers The other Guess Inc is about the worst notorious for itsmaltreatment of its workers and its ruthlessness in business Now if this werea story with an ending written by social democrats Levis would be rewardedand Guess would be punished And if this story had an ending written byneoclassical economists Guess would triumph and Levis would pay the price forits attempt to evade market imperatives What makes the story interestingthough is that young consumers are writing it and so it ends with twocompanies doing business in polar ways but arriving at exactly the same placesomewhere behind the curve            Levis is the worldslargest clothing manufacturer doing  billion in sales every year It is alsoone of the few privately held large companies left in the United States thanksto a managementled leveraged buyout in  Since the LBO which followed ayear in which the company saw its earnings drop by  percent Levis economicperformance has been outstanding thanks in no small part to the rebirth of the Buttonfly and unfortunately the remarkable success of Dockers A recentoutside appraisal of the company placed its market value at somewhere near times what it was in  a growth rate analogous to that of companies likeMicrosoft and Oracle            In thepast couple of years though Levis has struggled Overall sales have slowedand its share of the mens jeans market has shrunk from  percent in  to percent in  It would be great to see this decline as divine retributionfor the invention of Dockers but the answer has more to do with dramaticchanges in the kinds of jeans kids buy and Levis failure to adapt to thosechanges At a time when kids influenced by hiphop culture were buying jeanswith legs as wide around as their waists Levis was still pushing its classicstraightleg look And although its now starting to push its baggy Silver Tabjeans hard socalled private brands marketed by department stores like JCPenney are stealing the low end of the market while Ralph Lauren and hisclones are eroding the high end Levis has become the dreaded tweenercaught between the boomers and the echoboomers            The results have not been pretty A month ago Levisannounced that it would be closing  of its plants and laying off onethird ofits North American work force an astounding step for a company renowned forwhat its CEO called longterm brand building corporate social responsibilityand community involvement Levis workers have always been well paid relativeto the industry as a whole and the company has kept  percent of itsmanufacturing work force in Canada and the United States In  the companyimplemented Japanesestyle production techniques in its sewing plants breakingapart routinized assembly and giving individual workers more responsibilityEven Levis severance package is impressive With each laidoff workerreceiving eight months pay plus one week for every year of service andcompanyfunded retraining to boot one union observer called it by far thebest severance settlement apparel workers have ever gotten            Given allthat the easy way to understand what happened to Levi Strauss is to assumethat its generosity caught up with it If you employ unionized American workersinstead of dollaraday Mexican workers you will fail But a look at itscompetition shows that Levis main problem is not price cutting but image Itslargest competitor VF which makes Lee and Wrangler charges only marginallyless and yet its market share has risen as Levis has fallen Retailers likeTommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren whose jeans are not dramatically superior toLevis in quality are able to charge more simply because of their name In theend staying ahead of the style curve is both harder and more important thancutting costs            As evidence one might want to look at GuessInc the jeans maker legendary for making Anna Nicole Smith a household namewell in some households at least Guesstheres a question mark at the endof the name but typing it over and over is more annoying than you canimaginewas the hip jean of the s and it has spent most of this decadegrowing rapidly both at home and abroad Unlike Levis Guess has made its wayin the world by subcontracting out production work violating minimumwage andmaximumhour laws and suing everyone in sight In the s for example aspart of a legal battle with Jordache which at the time owned  percent ofGuess the Marciano brotherswho now own the companyset up a kickback schemewith contractors that ensured that money went to them and not to theirpartners About the same time they suborned an IRS agent into initiatingcriminal tax probes of Jordaches owners probes that ended up going nowherebut were wonderful harassment devices            In Guess paid the Labor Department  in fines for those minimumwage andovertimepay violations and things seemed to have quieted down a bit withinthe bulletproofwindowed razorwiresurrounded stone building that serves asthe companys bunker  I mean headquarters But in the past year and a halfGuess has seen its stock price cut in half had the only outside member of itsboard of directors quit after being on the job for a few weeks and watched itschief financial officer resign for personal reasons Meanwhile it has had aformal complaint filed against it by the National Labor Relations Board forfiring  employees who were trying to organize a union creating an inhouseunion to undermine those organizing efforts and coercing workers intoparticipating in an antiunion rally Its capitalism with an inhuman face            Coincidentally or not Guess earnings and revenue alsohave slid sharply and whats interesting is that Guess problems seem insubstance almost identical to Levis Although the Marcianos are legendary fortheir abusive and intimidating management styleone former company CFO calledPaul Marciano psychotic in a sworn affidavitand for their habit of takinghuge dividends out of the companys profits theyre not doing anythingdifferent today from the way they did business three years ago Theyve alwaysbeen crazy Its just that now the Guess label has lost its cachet The buzz isfading and the companys jeans in particular which a Fortune writeronce said made women look like Parisian hookers seem like a vestige of atime when we read Less Than Zero and listened to Echo and the Bunnymenwhich we may do still but while wearing khakis Without cachet what doesGuess have Mostly a really lousy laborrelations record            So is the moral of the storythat both the high road and the low road can take you into trouble if you stoppaying attention to the taste makers Partly But the differences between thetwo companiesboth its worth remembering controlled by a small group ofshareholdersalso demonstrate that the choice of the high or the low road is areal choice And our ideas of what constitutes a fair wage or a fair return oncapital are historically contingent Is a corporation supposed to net percent of its sales or  percent Should executives be paid  times themedian wages of their employees or  times The market does not dictate auniversal solution to these questions and so Levis and Guess are able toanswer them in very different ways Unfortunately in the face of the universalsolvent of hipness how you answer those questions seems to matter less thanhow you respond to this one So do you have the inchwide legs or dontyou
