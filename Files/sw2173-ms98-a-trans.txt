                okay   okay well i guess i can tell you that tonight is Murphy Brown thats the one i dont miss and i dont know if youve seen that thats with Candace Bergen   uhhuh ive never seen that before uhhuh ive heard about it but ive never watched in fact i dont usually watch TV on Monday nights i guess im either just really tired from the weekend and i get home well uh   yeah really     i have aerobics on Monday nights too i just didnt quite make it tonight because i was caught up at work for too long but   umhum oh jeez   but uh yeah i i usually dont get home until eight oclock so thats another good reason but   uhhuh id say thats the only one i dont miss or i try not to miss that one and Cheers on Thursdays   yeah i like Cheers   uhhuh but those are probably about the only two that i that i usually  with any regularity   uhhuh back when i had time to watch TV oh maybe last year when i wasnt doing aerobics and work wasnt quite as busy as its been lately um i liked The Wonders Years and uh um sometimes every now and then ill catch Doogie Howser because i think that comes on at eight on Wednesday nights and thats about the time i get home from aerobics and i turn on the TV as i sit down to eat dinner and ill catch that   uhhuh my daughter watches that religiously we tape it for her because it comes on at nine here and she has to go to bed at eight thirty and uh so that you know we watch it too while were taping it we watch it   uhhuh um oh no yeah yeah its kind of cute um   yeah i like the lessons its a good uh good its got a lot of good morals to it so i enjoy that one   yeah yeah i like uh what is it on Tuesday oh i think Coach is kind of funny on Tuesday night   oh thats right Coach yes thats another one that i try not to miss although it use to be better i dont know it seems well   yeah i like that one um i havent seen it in a while   yeah i was going to say i havent seen the past couple episodes i think the last one i really saw was when he broke up with Christine   umhum uhhuh   and i was thinking well do i really want her to go back with such a jerk   i know  i know its funny that that women even like that show because he really is hes such a jerk but then its just kind of funny because you you can sit there and laugh and go yeah what a guy  typical     uhhuh uhhuh  uhhuh yeah   but uh that ones kind of cute im real bad i got hooked on a soap opera when i was in college General Hospital   oh really   everybody in the dorm watched it i mean everybody you were an outcast if you didnt gather in the TV room at two oclock in the afternoon to watch this soap i mean people scheduled their class around it and everything so i   really um uhhuh   i started watching it and to this day i still watch it i just kind of got caught in that and then after i moved out of the dorm       my roommates watched General Hospital and they watched All My Children and some other soaps and i was going im not even going to be near that TV when they have any other soap on because i dont want to get stuck in another one one is bad enough no more but uh   i know excuse me just a minute i think Katy get off the phone   oops  how old is she oh   ten   so shes been getting hearing about the the different calls and ive ive been in the middle of tests and stuff so i keep you saying oh press three   sorry mom uhhuh yeah   so lets see i was trying to think of i dont think ive ever watched any soap operas i think my mom used to watch Young and the Restless but i dont i dont watch them   yeah dont ever start  thats just the thing   no  well my my last bosss wife she oh gosh she would run the tape player from the minute she went to go do her aerobics and she used to do like um filing at the hospital   uhhuh   and i think she did some work at a thrift store so as long as she was gone for about four hours well maybe three she would tape soap operas   oh gosh   and uh she would watch them at night when she came home   i just couldnt watch that much TV   i know he was saying he was so sick of soap operas because i guess for about four years now she you know hell come home from work and there shell be watching soap operas yeah   hum yeah course see four hours of soap operas is really going to translate into about two hours of TV watching time because theyre really half of it is just commercials they play more commercials in soap operas than anything ive ever seen in my life but still i just dont think i could sit down for two hours   oh really   and especially two hours of soap operas id thatd be that might be a real good way just to break that habit is to have to watch them for that long id kind of be like uh   umhum   this is enough  i cant take this any more  this is disgusting   right yeah well shes really shes really into it i guess but i never have gotten gotten used to well i just really never have been home i think during that time   yeah umhum umhum   and so i never had a chance and even when i was in school of course i always had classes about that time so i never had a chance but General Hospital huh is one to get hooked on if youre going to get hooked   uhhuh yeah yeah i think so i mean i guess thats the only one ive ever watched and i just i refused to i mean i never watched Dallas or Knots Landing or any of those things because its like   uhhuh no   i dont want to get hooked into one of these things that you have to watch it every week   uhhuh   i mean you can watch Coach from time to time and not have to you know not feel like oh wait im missing an episode and i wont know whats going on   right really   and so thats fine and i like LA Law too thats another one   and ive never watched that i going to have to watch that sometime   it is pretty good ive watched it maybe five or six times but it comes on kind of late on Thursday nights and sometimes im trying to get things done and get in bed so i can go to work of of course for you it probably comes on really late on Thursday night come to think of it   uhhuh yeah yeah they everything starts at eight and then it goes through ten and uh i dont think Johnny Carson comes on until like eleven   gosh oh gosh uhhuh   so everything really thats whats really cut into my TV watching is the time that everything comes on since its all shifted back an hour i just i dont really have time to stay up late and since i have to get up so early to go to classes   uhhuh um   i cant stay up past ten thirty im falling asleep anyway  so i miss most everything anyway   uhhuh yeah   but uh lets see   yeah i havent watched Johnny Carson in a long time i used to watch that and i used to watch David Letterman and things like that in college and Love Connection that was one of my favorite ones in college because wed get up in the in the apartment   uhhuh   and the guys from downstairs who by the wa y two of them were from San Antonio there were three of us girls upstairs and three guys downstairs and theyd come upstairs and watch it with us and wed all sit there and     uhhuh   you know wed be yelling and going pick this one pick this one and we just had it was just a fun you know fun thing to watch but uh   uhhuh   ive never seen it what is it is it like a version of the dating game or huh   kind of yeah they have the three choices on video and its usually real funny because theyll usually get someone in there that half the time the dates didnt work out at all and they have to tell about their date and how it went and   oh God   half the time theyll say well when he showed up at the door he didnt really look quite like his video and i just wasnt real sometimes they really burn each other its really kind of funny but   uhhuh that is terrible and the other person has to hear it   yeah well then if the other person hears something like that they come back just as bad  and hell say well she underestimated her weight by quite a bit  and they they just got you know they they go back and forth and its kind of funny um   oh uhhuh oh gosh uhhuh uhhuh   and then youll see the real funny looking couples and its its it was just entertaining and of course that was   uhhuh   thats been probably oh five six seven years ago since   oh gosh i was going to say i never heard of that one The Love Connection   we used to do that but uh i dont know if it even still comes on but that was always fun   uhhuh oh yeah i hadnt heard that one lets see i cant oh gosh that that probably wipes out my whole inventory of TV shows other than um PBS i   yeah   right now theyve got that Katherine Hepburn one where shes touring all the gardens of Europe i of course have missed the first series of that but thats about the only thing that i really catch on PBS   umhum umhum yeah   and uh we used to get Arts and Entertainment in San Antonio and i we get a little bit of the good ones here but we used to try and catch uh some of the stuff they had on there   uhhuh   and like i said  i dont really watch TV too much any more uh   yeah sometimes ill turn on CNN or something like that in the morning when i if i i get really sick of the radio in the morning because they just theyre so obnoxious   oh uhhuh   and so ill turn on the TV and just i can hear it back in the bathroom and you know keep up kind of whats going on in the world so ill do either CNN or Good Morning America or something like that but from time to time      uhhuh uhhuh well we used to watch CNN because that was the only thing on really early that i could an update on all the news but with the war coverage i had had it with reporters   umhum yeah   and the coverage and so after a while i just turned it off i said i cant take it any more i just cant   yeah yeah i havent watched it since the war started i CNN though was it was a life saver for me back in October   uhhuh   TI had sent me to Taiwan actually they sent me to six foreign countries Taiwan was right about in the middle and all they speak there is Chinese and in my hotel room there was nothing but Chinese programs on and they had CNN   uhhuh oh     and i just kept that thing on constantly because i was going English language this is wonderful and and they at least i kind of knew what was going on on the other side of the world and trying to keep up with     uhhuh uhhuh   okay whats the weather been like and whats happening back in the US because by then id been out of the country for three weeks already and i was i was you know wondering whats been happening lately but   yeah i i never knew that i never even thought that they would have CNN on in Taiwan   yeah believe it or not   i guess that keeps anybody thats traveling thats American over there youd think that theyd put it on in Chinese or translate it in Chinese   yeah it was in English they had it in Tokyo too in English but they had they had they had Married With Children have you ever seen that before   huh no ive heard about it ive seen a little bit of it it was kind of   they had that on in Tokyo i watched it one night ive seen it here before a few times its a real sarcastic type show its kind of funny   huh   um i thought i cant believe theyre playing that in Japan these people over there must think we are horrible i mean some of the American shows were some of the worst ones we have and thats what theyre showing in Tokyo and im thinking   i know that i didnt much uhhuh oh   they must think Americans are just really terrible  if they watch this   they probably do you know if thats all they see of us oh God what a thought so next time i think of that next time i meet somebody from Japan theyre going to think oh Married With Children yeah thats what shes like   i mean yeah yeah it was pretty embarrassing shes like Peggy Bundy oh boy  and hes like Al Bundy   oh golly yeah because i i cant remember where ive seen clips of that but they were showing highlights of it and stuff and i was thinking whod think this is really up my alley for half an hour you know if im going to spend my time but it was   uhhuh yeah      um a lot of um borderline jokes yeah   uh
