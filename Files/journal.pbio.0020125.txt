                            Many damaged and mutant polypeptides as well as some normal proteins have a tendency        to aggregate in cells Some protein aggregates are capable of dividing and propagating in        cells leading to formation of similar aggregates in daughter cells or even in neighboring        cells due to infection These selfpropagating protein aggregates are called prions and        constitute the basis of prion diseases The infectious agent in these diseases is an        abnormal conformation of the PrP protein PrP        Sc  which makes it proteaseresistant and initiates its aggregation        Prusiner  The abnormal aggregated species can recruit normal soluble PrP molecules        into aggregates thus inactivating them The aggregates of PrP        Sc can proliferate within cells and be transmitted to other cells and        tissues leading to the spread of neurotoxicity                    Prion Domains        While so far only one prion protein is known in mammals several prionlike proteins        capable of forming selfpropagating aggregates have been found in various yeast species        The common structural feature of yeast prion proteins is the socalled prion domain        characterized by the high content of glutamines Q and asparagines N DePace et al         Michelitsch and Weissman  also known as the QNrich domain The prion domains        are the major structural determinants that are solely responsible for the polypeptide        aggregation and propagation of the aggregates Interestingly the mammalian PrP        Sc is fundamentally different from yeast prions since it lacks a        QNrich domain indicating that distinct structural features are responsible for its        ability to form selfpropagating aggregates The QNrich domains in yeast prions are        transferable in that when fused to a heterologous polypeptide they confer prion        properties to this polypeptide With a low probability soluble proteins with prion domains        can change conformation to form selfpropagating aggregates which can be transmitted to        daughter cells Lindquist  Figure  As with PrP        Sc  yeast prions efficiently recruit soluble molecules of the same        species thus inactivating them Lindquist  Chernoff  Wickner et al  Also        with low probability the aggregationprone conformation of yeast prion proteins can        reverse to a soluble functional conformation Certain yeast prion proteins when in soluble        conformation function in important pathways eg Sup forming PSI          prion controls termination of translation and Ure forming URE          prion controls some membrane transporter systems Aggregation of        these proteins leads to phenotypes eg suppression of nonsense mutations or transport        defects inherited in a nonMendelian fashion owing to the nonchromosomal basis of the        inheritance                    Inheriting Variations        A remarkable feature of yeast prion proteins is their ability to produce distinct        inherited variants of the prion For example PSI          prion could exist in several distinct forms that suppress        termination of translation to different degrees These variants of yeast prions are        analogous to different prion strains of PrP        Sc  which cause versions of the disease with different incubation        periods and different patterns of brain pathology The molecular nature of distinct PrP        Sc strains is determined by specific stable conformations of PrP        Similarly variants of yeast prions are explained by different stable conformation states        of the corresponding prion proteins Chien et al  Strict conformation requirements        for aggregate formation can also explain interspecies transmission barriers where prion        domains of Sup derived from other yeast species cannot cause formation of PSI          prion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in spite of a high degree of        homology This observation is very intriguing especially in light of a recent finding that        prion conformation of some proteins is required for formation of prions by the other        proteins For example for de novo formation of PSI          prion a distinct prion RNQ          should be present in a cell Derkatch et al  Osherovich and        Weissman  probably in order to crossseed Sup aggregates This is in spite of        relatively limited homology between the prion domains of these proteins The apparent        contradiction between the interspecies transmission barriers of very homologous prion        proteins and possible crossseeding of aggregates by prion proteins with more limited        homology represents an interesting biological problem On the other hand this apparent        contradiction may indicate that prion formation is a more complicated process than we        currently think and that it may involve many cellular factors                    What Do Prions Do        Although yeast prions have been studied for almost ten years very little is known about        their biological significance We do not know the functions of the majority of proteins        that can exist as prions Even if a function of prion proteins such as with Sup or Ure        is known we do not understand the biological significance of their prionization ie        that they aggregate and propagate in the aggregated form A very intriguing and unexpected        finding was that formation of PSI          prion causes a wide variety of phenotypic alterations which depend        on the strain background True and Lindquist  In fact comparison of yeast strains of        different origin each with and without PSI          prion showed that certain strains with PSI          prion have different sensitivity to stresses and antibiotics than        their nonprion derivatives despite their genetic identity In some strains cells with        PSI          prion demonstrated better survival than their nonprion counterparts        in the presence of inhibitors of translation or microtubules heavy metals low pH and        other deleterious conditions which of course gives a strong advantage to the PSI          cells It is likely that some genomic mutations could be suppressed        and therefore become silent when termination of translation by Sup is partially        inactivated in PSI          prion cells Lindquist  True and Lindquist  PSI          could also reveal previously silent mutations or their combinations        It was hypothesized that switches between prion and nonprion forms of Sup enhance        survival in fluctuating environments and provide a novel instrument for evolution of new        traits                    QN Does Not Necessarily a Prion Make        Searching genomes of various species demonstrated that a relatively large fraction of        proteins between  and  contain QNrich domains Michelitsch and Weissman  or        polyQ or polyN sequences These domains are often found in transcription factors protein        kinases and components of vesicular transport The QNrich domains usually are not        evolutionary conserved and their functional role is largely unknown Some of the QNrich        or polyQ domains facilitate aggregation of polypeptides especially if expanded owing to        mutations Such expansion of the polyQ domains in certain neuronal proteins could cause        neurodegenerative disorders eg Huntingtons disease or several forms of ataxia        Importantly aggregates formed by polypeptides with the QNrich or polyQ domains are not        necessarily selfpropagating aggregates ie prions In fact there are additional        structural properties of the polypeptides that provide the selfpropagation see below        Even if a protein with a polyQ domain does not form a prion its aggregation may depend on        certain prions For example recent experiments demonstrated that RNQ          prion dramatically stimulated aggregation of fragments of        recombinant human huntingtin or ataxin with an expanded polyQ domain cloned in yeast        Osherovich and Weissman  Meriin et al  RNQ          facilitated the nucleation phase of the huntingtin fragment        aggregation suggesting that this prion can be directly involved in seeding of the        aggregates The major question now is whether there are analogous prionlike proteins in        mammalian cells that are involved in aggregation of huntingtin or ataxin and subsequent        neurodegenerative disease        The first indication that mammalian proteins with QNrich domains can form        selfpropagating prions came from recent work with a regulator of translation cytoplasmic        polyadenylation elementbinding protein CPEB from         Aplysia neurons Si et al  The neuronal form of this protein has a        QNrich domain similar to the prion domains of yeast prions The QNrich domain from CPEB        CPEBQ when fused to green fluorescent protein GFP conferred upon it prionlike        properties The CPEBQGFP fusion polypeptide existed in yeast cells in one of the three        distinct states ie soluble many small aggregates or few large aggregates Mother        cells almost always gave rise to daughter cells in which the CPEBQGFP polypeptide was in        the same state indicating the ability of these aggregates to be inherited ie to        selfpropagate Furthermore fulllength         Aplysia CPEB protein when cloned in yeast can also exist in two        distinct states soluble and aggregated which is an inherited feature Very unexpectedly        unlike other prions the aggregated state of CPEB was more functionally active than the        soluble form Si et al  These data strongly suggest that metazoan proteins with        QNrich domains are potentially capable of forming prions The challenge now will be to        establish whether CPEB can exist as a selfpropagating aggregate in         Aplysia or mammalian neurons                    Mystery of Propagation        What makes protein aggregates in yeast propagate The key cellular element that is        critical for this process is molecular chaperone Hsp Chernoff et al  This factor        is specifically required for maintenance of all known prions within generations and        probably is not involved in prion formation ie initial protein aggregation PSI          yeast cells have about  seeds of this prion although this number        differed in different PSI          isolates and maintenance of about this number of seeds after cell        divisions requires functional Hsp Eaglestone et al  In fact in the absence of        Hsp prion aggregates continue to grow without increase in number and are rapidly lost        in generations Wegrzyn et al  Since this chaperone can directly bind to protein        aggregates and promote there disassembly Glover and Lindquist  it was suggested that        the main function of Hsp in prion inheritance is to disaggregate large prion aggregates        to smaller elements thus leading to formation of new seeds Kushnirov and TerAvanesyan         Interestingly although Hsp is conserved among bacteria fungi and plants        animal cells do not have this chaperone or its close homologs Therefore if yeasttype        prions with QNrich domains exist in animal cells there should be alternative factors        that disaggregate large prion aggregates into smaller species in order to keep the number        of seeds relatively constant and thus maintain the prions        The fact that some proteins with QNrich domains form selfpropagating aggregates        while others can aggregate but cannot form prions suggests that there should be some        structural elements either within the QNrich sequence or close to it that confer the        ability to propagate In an article in this issue of         PLoS Biology by Osherovich et al  the authors examined sequence        requirements for prion formation and maintenance of two prion proteins Sup and New        They noted that both prion proteins contain an oligopeptide repeat QGGYQ in close proximity        to QNrich sequences and examined the functional significance of the repeats for        aggregation and maintenance of the prions In New in contrast to a deletion of the Nrich        domain deletion of the repeat did not affect aggregation of the protein or formation of        the prion but abrogated inheritance of the prion With Sup the situation was somewhat        more complicated since repeats adjacent to QNrich domain affected both protein        aggregation and prion maintenance while more distant repeats affected only the prion        inheritance The authors suggested that the oligopeptide repeats facilitate the division of        aggregates either by serving as binding sites for Hsp or by altering the conformation        of the polypeptides in aggregates to promote access for Hsp Figure         The likely possibility was that the oligopeptide repeats could be interchangeable        between different prions leading to creation of novel chimeric prions In fact the        authors constructed an F chimera a fusion protein having the Nrich domain of New and the        oligopeptide repeat of Sup This fusion polypeptide efficiently formed prion F          Furthermore when the oligopeptide repeat sequence was added to a        polyQ sequence this fusion polypeptide also acquired the ability to form selfpropagating        aggregates This work therefore clarifies the architecture of prions by defining two        structural motifs in prion proteins that have distinct functions in aggregation and        propagation Interestingly not all yeast prions have similar oligopeptide repeat motifs        indicating that distinct structures could confer prion properties to polypeptides that can        aggregate It would be important to identify these structures in order to understand the        mechanisms of aggregate propagation The work of Osherovich et al  may help to        identify proteins from mammalian cells plants and bacteria that can potentially form        prions Finding these novel prions could be of very high significance since they may        provide insight into a wide range of currently unexplained epigenetic phenomena
