                    Background        Infection with the hepatitis C virus HCV occurs        primarily through percutaneous exposure to contaminated        blood or blood products Unlike most other viral hepatitis        infections that tend to be acute hepatitis C infections        are often chronic and persist for decades       The        longterm sequelae of chronic HCV infections include        increased risks of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular        carcinoma             HCV infection is a major public health problem in Egypt              Blood bank and communitybased surveys        conducted in Egypt have reported seroprevalence rates of        HCV to be as high as  in some parts of the country               These rates are substantially higher in the        Nile Delta region compared with the rest of the country            Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection transmitted        to humans from snails that harbor the parasite Most rural        and periurban areas located in the Nile Delta are in close        proximity to the distributaries of the Nile River or        irrigation canals drawn from the Nile These slow flowing        waters are infested with snails that serve as the vector        for the schistosomal parasite Schistosomiasis infections        in addition to HCV are hyperendemic in the Nile Delta        region            In the s s and early s mass campaigns were        conducted to treat schistosomiasis infections in these        areas during which individuals older than  years of age        were treated with tartar emetic injections            Serosurveys conducted in the s in Egypt have reported        positive associations between HCV infections and a history        of schistosomiasis or a history of having received        injections for the treatment of schistosomiasis               Based on this evidence the studies suggest that        inadequately sterilized needles and syringes used during        the campaign were probable causes for transmission of HCV        in the region        Since all the studies were conducted as crosssectional        surveys it is not possible to know whether the HCV        infections were preexisting at the time of the treatment        campaigns or whether they were incident infections as a        consequence of the campaigns The studies have also        reported low prevalence rates in the younger age groups and        high prevalence rates for the older ages suggesting that        individuals infected between the s to the early s        are now older and more likely to be seropositive compared        to those born after the campaigns A limitation of most of        the published studies is the implicit assumption in their        analyses that all the individuals in the survey are        independent of each other and that infection rates are        uniformly distributed both within and across all households        in the community If the suggested nosocomial mechanism of        transmission were true the assumption that infection rates        are uniformly distributed would not be valid because HCV        infections will tend to cluster within households that        participated in the campaign compared to households that        did not The uniform distribution assumption is further        complicated by the existence of subgroups of high risk and        low risk individuals within each house based on their date        of birth If a household participated in the campaign and        has an infected member there is a greater likelihood that        another member who resided in the same house at the time of        the campaign will be infected but a low likelihood that an        individual born within the same house after the campaign        period will be infected        We postulate that an entire household was more likely to        have participated in the campaign if at least one member of        the household had a history of schistosomiasis and received        treatment by injections compared to houses in which no        member reported a past history and parenteral treatment for        schistosomiasis Based on this premise we would expect        clustering of HCV infection in households in which one or        more members reported having received parenteral treatment        for schistosomiasis if the underlying reason for the        spread of HCV infection was in fact attributable to the        treatment campaign        Using the HCV infection status of individuals        participating in a community based serosurvey conducted in        the Nile delta of rural Egypt we tested the following        hypotheses to assess if the schistosomiasis treatment        campaigns were associated with transmission of HCV        i Participation by village residents in the        schistosomiasis treatment campaigns were likely to cluster        within houses with members of a house more likely to        participate in the campaign if at least one member        participated        ii Clustering of HCV infections within houses is more        likely among houses that participated in the treatment        campaigns compared to those that did not                    Methods                  Site          The study was conducted in Kalama a semiurban area          in Qalyub District of the Qualyabia Governorate The          village is located on the southeast edge of the Nile          River delta approximately  km north of Heliopolis          Cairo Egypt Irrigated farmlands and canals surround the          village a feature typical of the Nile delta The village          has a population of approximately   residents living          in about  houses Agriculture is the primary          occupation Residents live in small single story homes          either as single nuclear families or extended families          with multiple related nuclear families residing within          the same house The median household size was  persons          at the time of the study                          Population and serosurvey          Details of the study have been described elsewhere              Briefly after conducting a census in December           the village was divided into  geographic sectors          Every  thhouse was then systematically sampled for          participation in a serosurvey Of a total of  sampled          houses   household heads agreed to participate          Between January and June  after obtaining written          informed consent we conducted a serosurvey and          administered a questionnaire to the study participants          soliciting medical and behavioral risk factors for liver          disease History of schistosomiasis was obtained by          interview in which participants were asked whether they          had ever received a diagnosis of schistosomiasis          Regardless of their histories all participants were          further queried about past treatment for schistosomiasis          and whether the treatment was with oral drugs injections          or both Approximately  ml of blood was then obtained          via a venipuncture from each participant Persons under           years of age were excluded from the serosurvey          because earlier work in Kalama demonstrated HCV infection          to be rare in this age group     Baseline          sociodemographic information was collected at the time          of the census Household socioeconomic status was          classified as high medium or low according to a locally          developed scale Details of the laboratory methods used          to detect antiHCV antibodies have been described          elsewhere     Briefly serum from the blood samples          was screened for antiHCV antibodies by EIA Abbot          Laboratories All EIAreactive sera were evaluated with          either the second or third generation recombinant          immunoblot assays Chiron Corporation as confirmatory          tests Positive results by either of the immunoblot          assays were considered to be HCV positive positive for          antiHCV antibodies                          Statistical methods          For baseline comparisons of the HCV positive and          negative individuals we used the chisquare test or          Fishers Exact test when there was sparse data for          categorical variables For dimensional variables the          ttest was used to compare the two groups when the data          was normally distributed and the MannWhitneyU test          when assumptions of normality were not met          To test for intra and interclass clustering of HCV          infections we used a modified formulation of the          Generalized Estimating Equations GEE The original          formulation of GEE also referred to as GEE    is          used in the analysis of correlated data in which          clustering is treated as a nuisance factor that needs to          be taken into account at the analysis stage This          approach uses a working correlation matrix to model the          correlation between the repeated or related observations          for an individual or a cluster while simultaneously          adjusting for covariates in a generalized linear model          With the new formulation also referred to as GEE or          Alternating Logistic Regression ALR clustering can be          treated as a parameter of interest on which we can          perform hypothesis testing       Instead of          specifying a correlation matrix an OR is computed for          each cluster in this approach to detect clustering among          related observations Since the outcome of our study is          binary HCV positive or negative we describe the          approach for binary outcomes          For a family of size n if Y           j is the HCV status   negative            positive of the j thindividual we define          log PrY           j   PrY           j                              x           j              x           j                m x           mj           where the xs are m covariates for the j thindividual          For most analyses the xs are variables that describe          the baseline characteristics or are confounding          variables These variables could be specific to the j          thindividual such as age and gender or could be common          for the entire family eg race or socioeconomic status          of the family The s are the regression parameters to          be estimated We next define the odds ratio OR between          the j thand k thmembers of the family as                    The odds ratio is a commonly used measure of          association for categorical variables and assumes the          values between zero and infinity An odds ratio equal to          one suggests the lack of an association between          individuals In equation  an OR   for each of the           N C            number of ways in which we can          select  out of N pairs of members within a house          indicates the absence of clustering of disease within the          family On the other hand an odds ratio greater than one          will indicate clustering of disease within the families          It should be noted that the OR defined in  is not the          same OR that one conventionally uses to measure the          association between exposure and disease in casecontrol          or observational studies The OR in  describes the          odds of disease or no disease for another member in the          same cluster given that a member is affected or          unaffected We henceforth refer to this OR as OR for          clustering Such ORs are commonly used to describe          familial aggregation of disease in genetic studies              The OR can be modeled for subclasses or subclusters          within the main cluster as          log OR           jk             z           Where z indicates the class membership of the j k          pair within the house For example if we consider adults          within a house to be members of class a and children to          be members of class c then logOR           jk              aa             cc  or            ac depending on whether the j k          pair are adults children or an adultchild pair From          equation  we thus obtain two intraclass ORs namely e          aaand e ccfor adults and children respectively and one          interclass OR namely e acbetween adults and children A          significant            aa or            cc is suggestive of clustering within          adults or within children whereas a significant            ac is indicative of the existence of a          correlation between adults and children When z            there is a single class and the equation models a          constant log odds across all the clusters Estimates for          s and s are obtained by simultaneous estimation of          the parameters from equations  and  thereby          adjusting the ORs for covariates introduced in           Further details on the formulation estimation methods          features of the model and properties of the estimators          have been published elsewhere                To model subgroups of high and low risk groups within          houses we chose an age cutoff of  years based on an          examination of the agespecific prevalence within our          study and based on reports stating that parenteral          treatment of schistosomiasis was stopped between  and           with the introduction of praziquintal an oral drug          used to treat the disease     Further children          under  years of age were not eligible for receiving          injections during the campaigns Since children born in           would have been  years of age at the time of our           HCV study it can be safely assumed that they were          not present at the time of the schistosomiasis campaigns          This age cutoff has also been used in other studies                       We conducted our analysis using the ALR implementation          of GEE in SAS V SAS Institute Inc Cary NC Since          we assume that the parenteral treatment for          schistosomiasis in the campaigns for the entire house          occurred around the same time to model the correlation          between the members of the house ordering of individuals          within the house cluster is not relevant Hence to          model the OR for clustering of schistosmiasis treatment          in the house an exchangeable log odds ratio was assumed          With an exchangeable log odds ratio a constant OR for          clustering is assumed for all houses To estimate the          degree of clustering of HCV infections a history of          parenteral treatment of schistosomiasis in the house was          considered to be a blocking factor Separate log odds          ratios were estimated for each block with the assumption          that the log odds ratios are constant within each          block                            Results        The study sample contained  age eligible individuals        residing in  houses Of these   agreed to        participate in the study and provided blood samples The        number of participants within these houses ranged from  to         members with a median interquartile range of            members AntiHCV antibodies were evaluated for          of the blood samples collected A total of          subjects were seroreactive to HCV Individuals positive        for HCV were significantly older than those who were        negative p   Other variables measured at        baseline were comparable for the two groups Although not        statistically significant HCV seropositive individuals        were more frequently males and of low socioeconomic status        table  Age

children        under  years of age compared to  CI           for those  years or older p          Fifty adults reported receiving injections for the        treatment of schistosomiasis Houses in which an adult        member reported receiving parenteral treatment were more        likely to have other adult members with histories of        parenteral treatment for schistosomiasis The OR for        clustering of individuals receiving parenteral treatment        was   CI    p   suggesting        that past participation in the treatment campaigns tended        to cluster within houses        Among the  individuals who reported no history of        schistosomiasis or no parenteral treatment for diagnosed        schistosomiasis the prevalence of HCV was  compared to         for the  individuals who reported receiving the        treatment p   Examination of the degree of        clustering of HCV infections among houses with members that        received parenteral treatment

characteristics such as        socioeconomic status and risk group based on eligibility        for participation in the schistosomiasis treatment        campaigns all of which were significant

same        confounding variables was   CI    p                             Discussion        Our analysis reveals that there is significant amount of        clustering of HCV infections within houses of the study        village and that the infections are not distributed        uniformly across the village We also demonstrate that some        households were more likely to have participated in the        schistosomiasis treatment campaigns compared to others and        that the clustering of HCV infections were more likely        among the households that participated in the treatment        campaigns In the general population based on the time        period during which the treatment campaigns were conducted        and the ensuing age distribution of the HCV infections        obtained from multiple crosssectional surveys a temporal        and possible causal relationship between these two events        has been suggested     Our study adds to this finding        by studying these two events within the same population        thus providing further evidence that the spread of HCV in        the Nile Delta region was associated with the        schistosomiasis treatment campaign        The observation that households were more likely to have        participated in the treatment campaign if any member within        the house participated in the campaign is corroborated by        the manner in which the treatment campaigns were conducted        Unlike mass campaigns conducted for vaccinations where        housetohouse visits are made and residents are immunized        the treatment campaigns were conducted at centralized        health care facilities such as hospitals and clinics In        some instances these clinics were rolling clinics        established temporarily at the villages This situation        makes it likely that entire households rather than random        individuals would have visited the clinics based on factors        such as proximity risk of schistosomiasis infection to the        household and socioeconomic status Indeed our analysis        finds that socioeconomic status of a house was strongly        predictive of whether an individual tests positive for HCV        after adjusting for the effects of clustering        Potential limitations of this study need to be        mentioned Since reports of receiving injections for        treatment of schistosomiasis were by recall it is possible        that inaccuracies in the recall might have biased the        results of the study Additionally it is possible that a        report by one member of the family potentially influences        the response of another family member during the interview        process Such related responses will artificially tend to        show clustering of participation in the treatment campaigns        within the houses However since testing of sera for HCV        antibodies for the members of the family was done without        knowledge of which sera belonged to which family and since        clustering of HCV infections was observed within families        independent of the participation in the treatment        campaigns it is unlikely that the clustering of the        individuals participation in the treatment campaigns were        solely due to biased reporting since there is an         a priori reason to believe that such        clustering is possible on the basis of the manner in which        the campaigns were conducted It could be stated that        familial clustering of HCV infections may be due to other        factors or behaviors that are related to an increased risk        of schistosomiasis as well as an increased risk of HCV        infections Alternatively certain household behaviors such        as health care practices or tendency to visit providers who        use unsafe treatment methods could also result in        clustering of HCV infections within the families If this        were true and was the sole explanation for the clustering        of HCV infections within the household we would expect to        see HCV infections in the younger children too who were not        present in the households at the time of the treatment        campaigns within such families However our previous work        in this village found HCV infections among children less        than  years of age to be extremely rare thus making it        less likely that unmeasured factors might be influencing        this association        Despite the use of oral drugs for the treatment of        schistosomiasis during the past two decades HCV antibodies        were detected in some children below  years of age        Vertical transmission of HCV from infected mother to infant        occurs in approximately  of HCV infected mothers and is        reported to increase with increasing viral loads            Prospective studies could help determine the relative        contribution of vertical and horizontal transmission of HCV        infections observed in these children        Most previous studies that have that have found        associations between histories of schistosomiasis and HCV        have either been designed as surveys or have used ecologic        associations While ecologic associations are very useful        for generating hypotheses one should be cautious in trying        to make individual level inferences from population based        observations because of the multiple sources of biases        associated with such study designs     After using the        appropriate analytic methods our results provide further        evidence for an association between the parenteral        schistosomiasis treatment campaigns and the transmission of        HCV infections in Egypt
