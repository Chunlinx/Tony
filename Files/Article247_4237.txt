                                 The LA Times Blasts  the LA Times            Chatterbox started reading the LosAngeles Times  page investigation of itself well before noon If you dontknow what Chatterbox is talking about click here andhere andhere He didnt finish until after the sun had set Even granting that Chatterbox hadone or two other minor tasks to complete today it does seem that seven hoursis more time than any reasonable person should have to spend reading about thegenesis of a singletopic edition of a Sunday magazine Someone less familiarwith the LA Times  tradition ofrunning stories at approximately five times their logical length might suspectthat publication of David Shaws opus Crossing the Line was a deliberatescheme to hide news of its publishers and editors misbehavior by burying itinside a selfimportant and interminable narrative that almost no one wouldhave the patience to read The thing came in  chapters and there was somuch throatclearing that the sixthwas actually called The Prelude But in fact the length was the LA Times  own daft way of saying that itviews the recent corruption of its editorial standards as a serious matter            Shaw wins bravery points for all but calling his newspapers publisherKathryn Downing and its editor Michael Parks a pair of liars who ought to besacked forthwith Downing never told Parks until very late in the game that theLA Times                Magazine s special issue celebrating theopening of the Staples Center was going to share ad revenues with the newdowntown sports arena She kept this secret she says because she didnt wantto corrupt editorial processes But its much likelier Shaw writes that shedidnt think it was a big deal the actual quote is from Dick Stanton seniorvice president and chief operating officer for the paper When the news staffheard about the revenuesharing deal and revolted Downing gave assurances thatthe Staples Center hadnt helped sell ads In fact Shaw shows they hadThats us that was us that was us that was us says Tim Liewekepresident of the Staples Center paging through the issue with Shaw andpointing out ads he and his staff helped to get Downing also told the angrynews staff that she was canceling the adrevenuesharing agreement with theStaples Center and sending it a check instead But the check still hasnt beensent Shaw reports Perhaps it was sent today after Downing read hisstory            Parks the LA Times  editor insists that at various planningmeetings when the revenuesharing arrangement was discussed or mentioned inmemos that were handed out he was somehow not paying attention or out of theroom talking to John McCain or something He says that when he did find outabout it in September he was outraged but Shaws reporting shows his reactionto have been weirdly muted He didnt have the special issue canceled eventhough at that point most of the magazine hadnt yet been printed he didnteven consider running a disclosure statement about the deal which would havebeen laughably easy to do Parks tells Shaw that he told Felicity Barringer ofthe New York Times  who broke thestory of the Staples deal in the national press that it was an inappropriatearrangement and we should not have done it but Barringer who is ascrupulously fair reporter tells Shaw he never told her anything likethat            Shaw also deserves kudos for documenting his newspapers decline under TimesMirror chief Mark Willes who interestingly was still publisher when theStaples contract was signed The horror stories include a representative of anadsales firm impersonating an LATimes reporter the ad department telling advertisers of a MillenniumHome contest the winner of which would be profiled in a followup featurearticle  that the editors neither knew of nor would approve and variousLA Times news staffers beingcorralled into planning profitmaking LA Times conferences of various kindsfeaturing people they wrote about Although the papers slide into ethicallyquestionable business practices predates Willes arrival Shaw makes clear thatWilles has accelerated it            Chatterbox must fault Shaw though for offering only the sketchiest answerto a question Chatterboxraised when the story first broke namely what business justification was there for theLA Times to enter into itsfoundingpartnership deal with the Staples Center As Chatterbox pointed outthen the dollar value of the newspaper concession and the ad placements andthe skybox inside the arena which appear to be all the LA Times gets out of the partnership iswell under  million annually Yet the LA Times ended up paying  millionannually for the privilege This is better than the  million or  millionthat was previous reported but its still a bad financial deal Shaw reportsthat the Staples Center was demanding  million to  million from its otherfounding partners and that the LATimes suits felt very clever for having bid Staples down Of its annual million payment the LA Timespays  in cash  in free advertising and about  inprofits from joint ventures This last which has come to symbolize in mostpeoples minds the corruption of editorial standards implicit in the deal wasviewed at the time in the words of the person who negotiated the deal as away for us to be able to make this deal during a time when cash was a problemPerhaps coincidentally when the LATimes set about calculating how much it had netted off the Staples Centerissue it found that after making extremely complex estimates regarding the useof staffers time the Staples Centers agreedupon  percent share was  But if the LA Times wasswindling the Staples Center it was only in the context of a larger deal inwhich the Staples Center had conned the LA Times             Perhaps that story should be assigned to a writer in the LATimes  business section It could probably be explained quite exhaustivelyin a few hundred words
