eaten one by one and Hair upon hairmakes a beard             Proverbs may be considered as a rough guide tolocal customs traditions in a nutshell  To understanda people acquaint yourself with their proverbs  or asanother proverb puts it Customs are the fifth elementof the world   Of these customs hospitality andgenerosity among the Arabs have pride of placeThe generous heart does not grow old The house thatreceives no guests receives no angels A rich man whois ungenerous is like a tree without fruit  or moresuccinctly Food for one is food for two One cup ofcoffee forty years friendship             Yet if hospitality is celebrated its pitfalls arealso charted  He ate the camel and all it carried pithily describes the overeager guest  Guests andfish after three days start to stink  or

is a frequentlytranslated example  Families as the proverb suggestsshould be closely knit  They should also accordingto most proverbs be large There is no lightin the house without children Nobody knows when aman without daughters dies   Or concerning the elderlyA house without an elderly person is as a gardenwithout a well   Motherhood is also highlypraised When a mans mother is at home his

how to annoy its parents  whileundercutting the standard injunctions to marry wehave A man with two wives becomes a porter   Theexistence of many opposites suggests that proverbsperhaps once came in pairs to be swopped in a sortof verbal wrestling one vying with another or sometimescombining with it the idealistic and the skepticalin balance The man without children has a holein his heart the man with children has a heart like asieve Your family may chew you but they will notswallow you             Proverbs can be equally ambivalent when itcomes to friendship  Straightforward enough is

The Almighty might providethe dervish with a kitchen but conversely Hesends almonds to those without teeth            All this might be depressing until we rememberhow proverbs also have an inbuilt

Sometimes a change of stress does not alter themeaning  British speakers or at least those heardon BBC often emphasize certain phrases differentlyfrom their American cousins  Thus to BBC announcersPresident Clintons residence is theWhite House  while to Americans it is the WhiteHouse and I once heard a BBC announcer say Prometheus Bound when an American would havesaid Prometheus Bound   As far as I can discoverhono u rbound and northbound are stressed in thesame way on both sides of the Atlantic that is byboth groups of English speakers  not the same asEnglish speakers             Recently in Maine a television advertisementfor a large paper company ended thus X CompanyCaring about the state were in   Normally the primarystress would fall on caring with a secondarystress on state   By stressing state with a secondarystress on in the advertisement gaveor tried togivethe impression that X Company however itmay be viewed by environmentalists really caresabout the State and the state of Maine            Another nationally aired series of advertisementsrelied on some wordplay achieved by wronglystressing the first word of the name of a breakfastfood whose pseudocolloquial garble I will not dignifyby quoting  Ordinarily in the phrase nut and honey both nouns would bear equal emphasis  In the advertisementthe first was stressed yielding Nothinghoney  Ah well  A kind of rapture of the deepseizes writers of advertisements when they try toplumb the publics tolerance of inanity            The confusion caused by such differently orwrongly placed emphasis in a phrase is

barely if at all distinguishablefrom the similarly misstressed ef flu entsor of defuse  when a failure to place nearly equalemphasis on both syllables leads to the words beingmistaken for the verb diffuse             In recent years according to The Oxford Companionto the English Language  The BBC PronunciationUnit has made some changes in its recommendationsto broadcasters who are now beingadvised among other things to stress the first insteadof the second syllable of controversy  the secondsyllable of dispute as both verb and noun andthe first syllable of cervical  instead of the secondwith  i  as in nine   Presumably urinal  i  as innine  is now also stressed on the first syllable  I suspectthat the new policy rather than being a reflectionof changes in the speech of literate Britons is anodor perhaps a resigned shrugin the directionof overseas English speakers since the new pronunciationsconform with those of at least some overseasspeakers among them Americans            Yet with the exceptions of af flu ence defuseand for Americans the nowdisapproved cervicalthese examples of difference in stress can be said tobe no more than small blips in the smooth flow ofideas  Far more confusion is being caused by theinsidious loss of secondsyllable stress in words thatare both verbs and nouns  Of course there arewords that are pronounced and stressed exactly alikein both syntactical uses accord control decree dismayet al but these words appear to be in the minorityMore numerous are those transformed byfirstsyllable stress from verbs to nouns or less commonlyto adjectives  Examples areabstract   consort    impress   purposeaddress    contest    object    recordcompact    contract   pervert   subjectcompress   frequent   purport   suspect                        Sometimes even these verbs may be stressed on thefirst syllable by way of contrasting two actions orconditions as in it has de creased not in creased            While such distinctions have no effect on ourunderstanding of the written word which has punctuationto help it in speech they are useful pointersto syntax and meaningor could be if only speakerswould make phrases like the following

not given to viewing everychange in language with fear and loathing it doesseem that any loss of clarityespecially on the partof politicians and of those who are the principal purveyorsof informationought to cause some alarmIt may be symptomatic of such losses that today theadverb of choice is clearly used even more oftenthan the hucksters Free  and since clarity of expressionand

master was shaping the vocabularyof schoolboys  This was the unique CharlesHamilton alias Frank Richards Martin CliffordOwen Conquest Winston Cardew and many otherpennames  Truly he has been called the world writingchampion but now is most remembered for hiscreation of Billy Bunter the Fat Owl of the Remove            Turn through the pages of his comics TheMagnet and The Gem and the dated charm oftheir schoolboy slang lives again  Copies even foundtheir way into the trenches of the First World Warso Frank Richards his favorite name stamped generationsof boys from  to  and even laterwhen the tales were turned into books up until thelast Bunter Story appeared in  shortly beforeRichards death            Although his school tales were spun aroundpublic schools many of his young readers went toState schools but still read his matchless prose withdelight   copies of The Magnet were soldweekly throughout the British Isles  Even GeorgeOrwell was moved to comment on the phenomenonThe year is

unquestionableEverything will be the same for ever andever                        FR captures the youthful slang of that innocentera when life consisted of countless exclamationmarks  Bunter is much given to apprehension Ohcrikey Oh jiminy Oh lor or when an even worsefate is expected Yarooh Harry Whartons favoriteGreat pip influenced many young readers while Ohcrumbs or What the thump  or Oh my hat were alltypical expression in the s and appear in PGWodehouse novels also as both influential writershad a vivacious approach to slang  Key words of thatera are cheery chums and breezy all much used byFrank Richards  His own favorite expression wasAll is calm and bright            Few writers of school tales were as erudite asthis shy scholar who once wrote a Bunter tale inLatin which was printed in an issue of The TimesEducational Supplement in   The richness andvariety of his own vocabulary was a good influenceon that army of young readers  Mr Quelch formmaster of the Remove was a beast but a just beast aphrase echoed by many schoolboys of that era  Hewas as sharp a Latin scholar as FR himself andclearly had an effect on the vocabulary of his foolishand absurd pupils especially in the insults they exchangedwith each other copied by their readersYou spoofing sweep You frabjous ass You fat duffer                        Mr Quelch would describe the chubby Bunteras have an extensive circumference  and more verbalriches were supplied by Hurree Jamset Ram Singhthe young Nabob of Bhanipur who acts like a cheerfulGreek chorus  Is it a go asked Bunter  The gofulness is not terrific chuckled the young Nabob  Thegoodfulness of the riddance is great but the cheekfulnessof the idiotic Bunter is preposterous  This amusingmix of fractured English and an excellent vocabularywas enjoyed and copied by young readers whorelished the ridiculous            The pages of FRs schoolboy stories were pepperedwith Cave and Ware breaks  The jolly oldbeans got his jolly old back up  so one sees howsmoothly these stories prepared the readers for thetransition to Wodehouse and encapsulated the ideaof the laidback Englishman in the idiom of thattime  Ripping whopper lie nunky for uncle takea pew seat on their jiggers bicycles playing thegoat a measly solicitor cad and rotter and similarexpressions were all part of typical schoolboy slangbefore World War II and FRs tales are brimmingwith them            As one fan now elderly recalled Errand boyswere able to enter through the Gem and Magnetinto a new world where the talk was of fivers andtenners motorbikes and gold watches things theyhad never encountered at that time so their horizonsas well as their vocabularies were extended            Bunters longawaited postal order was a jokeevery boy understood but Frank Richards wasclever enough to adapt his use of schoolboy slang tothe changed times  Before World War II he wouldwrite that Bunter couldnt care a straw but in hislater novels he changed this to couldnt care less sohis ear for dialogue stayed tuned into very old age            The code of schoolboy honour remained steadfastas did the erudite smattering of French andLatin phrases and quotations from the Bible andShakespeare that made Frank Richards school taleseducational as well as entertaining  The recent resurgenceof interest in his stories in modern reprintsand broadcasts shows that this archaic schoolboyslang is still perfectly recognizable and acceptable toa new generation as we near the st century  Thatgap between the charismatic master of the DeadPoets Society and the prolific Frank Richards isnarrower than one might think                              Some English Loanwords in Thai            The strangest example of a loanword I have encounteredin Thai is halfEnglish halfItalianmusically derived dedsmollay  At first I took it to beFrench because of its sound but actually it comesfrom the Dean Martin song Thats Amore which enjoyedenormous popularity here  If you recallWhen the moon hits your eye like a great pizzapieThats amore  Thais chose to hear dead for thatand corrupted s amore to smollay thus dedsmollayhas been a common slang word for dead for thirtyyears or so            Thailand is the only southeast Asian nation tohave avoided colonization by a western power sothere are significantly fewer English loanwords inThai than there are French in Lao Vietnamese andKhmer English in Malay and Burmese and Dutch inIndonesias various languages  That is not to say thatThai has been slow or reluctant to adopt or assimilatewords from other

apologized for having used the word welsh inthe sense cheat by failing to pay a gambling debtgo back on ones word  RHD Unabridged  in anearlier program  Presumably the Welsh lobby hadgone after him in the mistaken assumption that theword derives from the word Welsh of pertaining toor characteristic of the people of Wales  The RHDprecedes that etymology with perh meaning obviouslythat there is some possibility of that derivationthe OED etymology is Origin unknown  Examinationof the scores of senses listed in the OEDfor Welsh n  reveals that virtually all are either entirelyneutral or complimentary the two possible exceptionsare welshcomb comb ones hair by usingones thumb and fingers instead of a comb andWelsh cricket louse  Of the latter type many examplescould be listed on the order of Irish pennantuntidy loose end of a rope  The RHD labels theterm  sometimes offensive  which does not meanthat it is offensive occasionally but that it is offensiveto some people presumably Irish  Have the Frenchraised an international brouhaha at the UN about theFrench disease  Have the British applied to the InternationalCourt of Justice about the English diseaseHave adherents to

amongstthe Croats about the Serbs and amongst the Muslimsabout the Serbs and the Croats  Recently the head ofthe California Bar Association delivered an address atthe annual meeting decrying jokes about lawyerssuggesting that a man who had raided a law office andkilled some people in it had been inspired or spurredon by the derisive attitude toward lawyers that lawyerjokes fostered  Oddly it was in the same McLaughlinprogram referred to above that this issuewas raised and promptly ridiculed as ludicrous onecan assume only that McLaughlin felt more pressuredby nationalistic and ethnic interests than by lawyers            VERBATIM ran an article Politically CorrectNomenclature or How to Win at Trivial Pursuit andLose Friends XVIII  by Marc A Schindler thatdelved into the subject

Gervais has beenhailed into court  When I was a lad the word niggerwas taboo in the US but it was used freely till recentlyin Britain meaning any darkskinned personthe word Negro with a capital N  was carefullyused instead  Then at about the same time whencolored was anathematized despite the National Associationfor the Advancement of Colored Peoplewhich has still not changed its name black was legislatedby that community of speakers to supplantNegro and colored though I cannot recall any ridersrequiring a capital B    Cape Colored or moreproperly Coloured is retained in South Africawith a specific denotation of a person of mixed Europeanand African or Malayan ancestry  RHD Unabridged in which one must read White for Europeanand darkskinned for African or MalayanThere cropped up here and there objections to theuse of black to describe things other than good andpure and Black is beautiful became the catchwordof the day  Is it my imagination or do I detect intimationsthat black is on its way out  In a perfectworld there would be no need to refer to people bytheir skin color many years ago newspapers agreedto omit mention of an individuals color but they gotround that by showing a photograph today televisionnewscasters avoid irrelevant mention of skincolor but they seem almost relieved to be able toshow a picture of someone being arrested and oflooters and rioters

not seem to make any difference to her  ImJewish she explained and its enough for me totouch the name            Ironically given Oskar Schindlers role in savingthe lives of Jews in Poland and

were forced to live in special ghettoesDepending on the nature of the local liege lord thatwas partly for their own protection and partly sothey could be controlled  The restrictions of theghetto were not only geographical inhabitants wereusually restricted in the trades they could engage inCrafts were usually not allowed since the craftguilds excluded Jews but Jews were allowed to engagein banking and related industries such aspawnbroking mercantile pursuits and longdistancetrading            As the symbol of the pawnbroker was the threegold balls ef the family arms of the RothschildsGoldstein

Schindler on the other hand was a guild craftThe English cognate would be shingler or shinglemakerand the word originally comes from theLatin scindere  meaning to split  One thinks ofsplitting a cedar wood block to make what we wouldcall shakes in English  However the Schindler notonly made shakes he also built and surfaced the entireroof of a house so in my opinion the name reallycorresponds better with the English surnameTyler  As a guild craft roofing would normally havebeen closed to Jews during the era when surnamescame into use amongst the guild classes  Indeed inthe book Schindlers List there are two personsnamed Schindler Oskar Schindler the protagonistwho was a Catholic Sudetendeutscher ethnic Germanfrom Bohemia or Moravia and a BrigadierSchindler an official with the Wehrmacht procurementoffice in Berlin who one presumes was notJewish            About ten or twelve years ago when I startedtraveling in the course of my business as internationalbusiness manager for a medical company Iwould often look up Schindlers in local phone booksand write them to see if we might be related  I underestimatedthe commonness of the name  When Igrew up on the Canadian Prairies my teacherswere mostly WASP and had a hard time spelling orpronouncing my name  I thought that my name wasunique and exotic like those of my fellow ethnicGerman and UkrainianCanadian classmates  Itcame as a surprise to find that there are Schindlers inalmost every large city of the world I have visitedincluding those in Europe Australia South Africaand even Latin America  Starting about five yearsago I started seeing the little white service wagonsof the Schindler Elevator Co a Swiss companyzipping around downtown Ottawa Toronto andMontreal            I engaged in many Briefwechsel with Schindlersand Shindlers from London to New York to Melbourneto Cape Town and found that many were infact Jewish  Most of these have anglicized or yiddishizedtheir names to Shindler   As one LondonShindler told me The German language has nothingbut bitter memories for us so my father adoptedthe English spelling when we moved here after theWar            How this exception to the rule occurred is impossibleto determine but it is not really difficult toimagine that it could easily have happened over thecourse of centuries of intermarriage  I have oftenwondered what might happen if during one of myvisits to the Middle East I should become the objectof interrogation by someone with shall we say anurgent political agenda  Would he look into mytrousers to determine my religion  He would have aproblem of course because most North Americangentiles of my age bear the visible signs of the Covenantof Abraham  How would I explain that whilemany Jewish names may look German they are

ofAustralia yet no one visiting the former convict colonycan be untouched by the tangible pervasivenessof the past and the importance attached by Tasmaniansto activities and events which in mainlandterms are long gone  Part of this impression comesfrom the states increasing dependence on tourismand its readiness to dress up the differences in wayslikely to appeal to tourists from overseas and fromother parts of Australia who feel they have movedwith the times  The very word convict is more prominentin everyday spoken English than it is in saySydney with compounds like convict

Dutchexplorer Abel Tasman or its facetious variantVandemonia former Tasmanian convicts beingknown on the mainland as Vandemonians                                       Convict piner indicates both a retention of and atransition from the past  A piner is and was a timbergetterwho specialized in Huon pine a conifer producingan attractive and highly valued timber onceused for boatbuilding but now protected and employedmainly in the manufacture of touristy artifactsPining was unequivocally an occupation  Thepiner once lived in a badger box  a makeshift shelternamed in allusion to the wombats capacious hole inthe ground the wombat being known uniquely inTasmania as a badger to which it bears a passingresembalance  This highlights the retention of termsbelonging to the past that have been

applecarver is the fruit of a somewhat desperate attemptto provide entertainment and Apple Island or Isleis part now of a deliberately created nostalgia fora past in which there was once a thriving

VERBUM SAP                                          Verbum Sap The Media Is the Message            I have few data to support me and my staminaare not up to long tedious research but I have ahunch that media the main agendum on many apedants plate these daysis well on its way to becominga standard singular noun except perhapsamong hidebound literati and intransigent intelligentsiaon various university campi in style booksand in other blessed receptacles of holy semanticwrit  My hunch also tells me that there are morepeople who use media as a singular noun than thereare people who write bristling letters to the editorinsisting on its immutable pluralitywhich is to saya lot            The media itselfthemselves has itstheir needlestuck in the old monaural groove  Most style booksstoutly maintain media is a plural noun period  TheNew York Times Manual of Style and Usage admitsthe existence of an alternative but dismisses it as asubversive plot  Media still a plural despite persistentefforts to turn it into a singular  It addswith smug ivorytower certainty The singular is ofcourse medium  The British Broadcasting CorporationsStyle Guide is also stuck in the mud  Its diktaton media says this Plural  The media sometimesdisplay not displays a sensational approach toevents  Remember also that data criteria and phenomenaare plurals  But the plural of referendum isreferendums not referenda  The Toronto Globeand Mail Style Book not only holds medias pluralitybut includes within its wide network books periodicalpublications radio TV advertising massmailing  How did they overlook town criers            In a recent Globe and Mail column a magazinecritic was taking pot shots at a gunsupporting USpublication called Womens Self Defense  Among histargets was a coverstory headline that read  Howthe Media Encourages Violence Yet DiscouragesWomen from Owning Guns  The magazine hetuttutted is full of similar grammatical mistakesI could detect no other solecisms so I assumed hewas taking aim at the use of the singular verb withthe noun media                        What these dauntless defenders of the statusquondam fail to detect is that a linguistically fascinatingand utterly inevitable semantic change is occurringhasalready occurred reallybeneaththeir very proboscises or proboscides for the classicallyrigorous  The result of this evolution is thatthere is now both a plural media and a singular mediaand each means something different  The legitimateand widely recognized singular meaning wasillustrated recently in the Globe and Mail despitethe Style Books taboo  The papers television criticbegan a story this way It is a mean cold morningdown at CHCHTV where the media has been invitedto risk its collective life on the icy highway fromToronto to Hamilton to preview a series premiereThe sense is clear and logical here  Thismedia does not include book publishers and junkmailpushers and no reader would take that meaningIt means simply the news media or whatused to be called the press used as a collectivesingular as early as  See OED press n The press served the purpose well as long as it involvedonly print media  When radio and televisionjoined the club some new collective handle wasfelt to be needed  The public in its wisdom optedfor the nettlesome media first used in this sense toanyones knowledge in a  article in Advertising Selling called Class Appeal in the Mass MediaIn the same magazine the singular medium appearedbut so did the singular media  And eversince the purists have been more concerned aboutbad Latin than good English            The language has a way of sorting out awkwardsituations such as those created by the rather torturedproper examples in the first paragraphData still in transition is usually singular outside academicand scientific settings  Stamina plural of stamen has been singular since the early th centurywhen like media it developed a new sense  Agendawhich once had the

cognoscente  Campi is a joke  Bacteria hasjust about completed its evolution to singularity  Criteriaand phenomena heard everywhere as singlesare encountering stern opposition from people whotake care to speak of a grafitto but never say a confettoMany of them also talk of octopi unaware thatthe correct Greek plural is octopodes or that theaccepted anglicized one is octopuses the simple Englishplural  s or  es  as in thesauruses campuses formulasindexes and memorandums                                       Mediums would have made sense but usage dictatedthe plural media  And certainly it is still aplural in such senses as various media are on displayat the art show  But media unmistakably hasalso taken on a monolithic unitary sense  I am happyto let the usually conservative American HeritageDictionary have the last word  As with the analogouswords data and agenda the originally pluralform has begun to acquire a sense that departs fromthat of the singular  medium  used as a collectiveterm media denotes an industry or community                              Contemporary English Word Lists            In the early s while I was directing thecompilation and editing of The Random House Dictionaryof the English LanguageUnabridged Editionit occurred to me that it would be extremely usefulto have a listing of a large number of English wordsalphabetized from the rightthat is listed in normalspelling order but with words ending in a followedby those ending in b and so on to those endingin z  My primary purpose was to facilitate theexamination of suffixes and desinences  It was a simplematter to find words beginning with prefixes likeanti pre pro un etc but finding those thatended in able graph ity ous  etc was an entirelydifferent matter  There was no problem identifyingthe obvious ones but the less common ones were abit more elusive            As Random House was unable to fund such researchI approached someone I knew at Air ForceIntelligence at Griffiss Air Force Base in RomeNew York with my proposal suggesting that such ananalysis would yield useful results for cryptanalyticalresearch  I was summarily turned down in a peremptoryletter that questioned the possible usefulness ofsuch an enterprise  I was consequently a little surprisedandpleasedto be phoned a few monthslater by one AF Brown a professor in the PsychologyDepartment at the University of Pennsylvaniawho told me that he had been called in by Air ForceIntelligence and given the job of preparing just sucha list  It was at the suggestion of the agency that hewas getting in touch with me as he had no notion ofhow to go about the work  We met in my office sometime later and being far more interested in the resultsthan in who did the work or got the credit I setforth for him the procedures that would yield thelist  Although nothing was committed to writing Igave Brown to understand that all I expected in returnwas a copy of the resulting work and an acknowledgmentof my help in his Foreword  Severalyears later the work was published in eight quartosizedthick volumes one set of which was duly deliveredto my office  The Foreword was totally devoidof any acknowledgment however            The first three volumes contained listed solidwords all in capital letters alphabetized from theright with codes for each indicating which one ormore of some eighteen sources that had yieldedthem  The fourth volume listed hyphenated formsin the same way  The next four volumes containedthe same listings as the first four but these werealphabetized normally from the left  The sourceswere mainly the MerriamWebster UnabridgedSecond Edition and in addition as number of otherspecialized medical scientific and other dictionariesI understand that an attempt had been made topersuade Merriam to allow the use of the entry listsfor the Third Edition but they refused  I cannot recallthe exact number of items in the lists but myimpression is that it was approximately   Asfar as I know the information is still available fromthe National Technical Information Service AlexandriaVirginia USA either in microfiche or as anenlarged machine copy of same            As this work is not mentioned in ContemporaryEnglish Word Lists one must assume that its existencewas unknown to the author but that shouldnot put off those who have need of a list that is notonly more up to date but is also more selective andon the grounds of frequency probably more usefulHyphenated forms  heavensent  and multiwordunits  old wives tale  are conveniently included in asingle listing though these are alphabetized wordbywordputting black sheep before blackberry taxfreebefore taxable  the list is short enough so thatthese are readily found in the Forward part  Imissed black hole which is widely used as a popularmetaphor and was a little surprised find reportedspeech Excellency presumably only a form of addressand sandwich course  Different forms of thesame word are listed eg exact exactly and exactnessexaggerate exaggerated exaggeratedly and exaggeration                        Is it vain of me to suggest that the author mighthave found it useful to have had at hand my Suffixesand Other Wordfinal Elements of English Gale ResearchCompany   It lists  wordfinal elementsmany of which are not represented in thebook under review  One might well counter thatwords containing those elements are therefore notcommon enough to merit inclusion but is that sufficient reason to omit  mane words  balletomane  bund words  moribund  and all words ending in phobe or  phile   I believe that to create a truly usefulwork even acknowledging its restrictions theauthor should have considered matters other thanraw frequency the criterion applied for use in theclassroom or at home  For instance I am not entirelysure what purpose is served in long lists ofwords ending in  ly that are adverbs formed on adjectivesa formula would not only have sufficed butwould enable some words like kindly and friendly to have been especially marked  Introducing a formulato cover  ize  ise variants and some otherswould have freed up space for more important inclusions            Of the three suggested uses for the booksteaching or learning English word formation employingthe list as a source of frequently used wordsand having available only items actually found inEnglish texts without theoften delightfulodditiesone can find in larger dictionariesthe lastseems to me the most telling  There are items listed those who argue about the size of nativespeakers vocabularies would be hard put to findany words or phrases that are not familiar and couldvery likely extend the list without difficulty  If semanticcriteria were applied to homographs whichappear only once like saw  and to polysemic itemslike take up take in etc  even the most naivespeaker could expand the list considerably            Laurence Urdang                              A Dictionary of FlyFishing            About a dozen years ago when looking througha mailorder catalogue of sports clothes I noticed asection offering fishing flies and became intriguedwith their namesnames like Cree Sedge andGreenwells Glory   In a desultory way I admit Itried to discover more about the names with an eyetoward compiling a work on the subject  I did manageto acquire a catalogue or two on fishing fliesone I recall was from Leonardsbut the entireproject slipped away from me to be replaced byother matters requiring more immediate attentionWhen I saw the present work in a British catalogueof sports clothes I sent away for it            I should explain that I fishedthough not seriouslywhenI was about ten years old at summercamp where we caught mostly sunfish I oncecaught a lake bass which we grilled on an open fireand ate only those who have eaten freshcaught fishknow the difference between them and the storeboughtvariety  Some forty years ago severalfriends persuaded me to join them on a partyboat togo fishing off Rockaway Beach near New York CityThe day was sultry without the slightest breeze tocreate even a suggestion of a cats paw on the surfaceof Sheepshead Bay I caught about twentyoddfluke which just lay there scarcely my notion ofgame fishing  As I had caught the most fish that dayI won a bottle of scotch but my friends wivesviewed with some alarm our return bearing amongus about fifty fluke all of which needed cleaningand of course either eating or freezing  I haveavoided fishing since            No selfrespecting reader of books can considerhis education complete without having read IzaakWalton  More recently I have seen fishing competitionson television happy to see that the fish werereturned to the waters whence they have beentaken  Most recently I saw on BBCTV a most enchantingfilm about two men who had gone fishingfor monster carp on a lake at a private estatesomewhere  It was quite beautiful  One might thinkthat watching other people fishing is like watchingthe grass grow it cannot compare for action withThe Terminator  yet it is far from boringespeciallyif one is watching an edited version and does nothave to sit on shore or in a boat for hours on endand that particular program punctuated here andthere by fishing lore was dreamily engaging andpeaceful well calculated to remove ones mind fromthe cares of the day            The literature of fishing goes back a long longtime  As I know little about it I shall not attempt toexpatiate on it here  The present book although itis called a dictionary contains much ancillary encyclopedicfolkloristic and fishloristic informationmost of it carefully referenced to sources which aredocumented in an eightpage bibliography  Myonly criticism of it is that the listing for the fifteenthcenturyTreatise of Fishing with an Angle appears asthe first item under Anon it ought to have across reference under Treatise  where I had sought itin vain            Typically an entry begins with the etymology ofthe headword egbaggot From a verbal participle baggedmeaning big with young pregnant  Sir Perceval The mere was bagged with sole                        In many entries the etymologies are far more repletethat for barb covers twelve lines of text            It would be more accurate to say that the termsare explained rather than defined opinions aregiven techniques are discussed carefully distinguishingbetween dry flyfishing and wet and thestyle is easy  The entries on mayfly  mayfly  andmayfly  the first being any upwinged insect thesecond the true mayfly and the third the stoneflycover four full pages more than six are devotedto sea trout  more than ten to nymph fishing   Mirrorand window goes into a fishs view of the worldLine drawings illustrate the single

Dover sole vronique or to standing hipdeep in an icy stream atdawn  It cannot be compared with a dictionary perse its headwords serve more as a point of departurefor McCully to hold forth on the

Slang            This dictionary combines two glossaries of underworldslang which were compiled by two prisonersin New South Wales in the middle of the twentiethcentury  It is more than a slang dictionarySimess own lexicographical analysis of the terms isdetailed and impressive and he also provides a fiftytwopage essay on the history of the literature andlanguage of crime and the underworld            The first glossary was compiled in  by TedHartley who was imprisoned as a conscientiousobjector in  and   Simes discovered thisglossary in  among the papers of the Australiannovelist Kylie Tennant at the National Library ofAustralia  Tennant came into contact with Hartleythrough the Conscientious Objectors Union requestedthe glossary from him and used it whenwriting her novel Tell Morning This   Given Hartleysstand as a conscientious objector it is not surprisingthat his more expansive glosses often extend into sociologicalcommentary            The second and longer glossary containing entries called The Argot  was compiled in  bya longterm prisoner known only as Thirtyfive fromthe custom of referring to a prisoner by the last twodigits of his official number  Although the existenceof the glossary was known especially because SidneyBaker cites some terms from it in the  editionof his The Austrialian Language  most of it hasbeen unpublished until now  Thirtyfive had been aschool teacher but the reason for his imprisonmentis unknown  A revised edition of half of The Argotalso exists  The revision includes material collectedin the period  but written up at a later dateafter Thirtyfive was released from prison  Themanuscript is dated October   From his commentaryit is clear that Thirtyfive when compilinghis glossary had access to a number of books includingPartridges Slang Today and Yesterday andthe  edition of The Australian Language   Hismore expansive glosses focus primarily on lexicographicalmatters including some etymologicalspeculation  Thirtyfive wrote a Preface to The Argotincluded by Simes as an appendix and hemakes some interesting observations about the kindof material he collected            Each entry in the dictionary consists of up tothree parts  The first is a blend of the headwordsand definitions from the three manuscripts HartleysThirtyfives  compilation and Thirtyfivesrevision indicating by date which manuscriptis being used  The texts are edited conservativelyso that spelling or typing errors are allowed to standThe second part is Simess lexicographical commentaryon the material provided by Hartley and Thirtyfiveoften giving information about the origin of theterm whether it is Australian whether it is otherwiseunrecorded and so on  The third consists ofillustrative quotations where available from othertexts mostly from Simess own files            Some of the material is international underworldslang hoist steal beak Brit   magistrate orjudge chiseller swindler dip pickpocket the

areas of lexical density reflect the socialstructure of allmale prisons most of the terms forwomen are pejorative there are numerous terms forheterosexual sex and an abundance of terms for thepenis  In his Preface Thirtyfive argues that the pejorativeattitudes towards women derive from thecriminals assessment of every woman according toher eligibility as a mistress p  whereas Hartleydiscussing the use of cunt comments Probablythis latter expression unconsciously carries with itthe contempt for femininity that most prisoners soldiers and others feel when forcibly shut off fromthe other sex  In this connection it is saddening toobserve the slow but certain deteriation  sic  in prisonerssome with fine feelings until their fianceesare spoken of as chromos and their wives as cntp   There is an obsession with homosexualitycat passive homosexual hock prisoner who is outto engage in homosexual practices honey bm passivehomosexual whitewash someones kidneyscommit pederasty on            The glossaries include material which is not specificto the underworld or to prisons  There areterms from general English make a balls of muckup bugger up bang intercourse outsider horsedog starting at long odds  There are general Australiancolloquialisms put the acid on put the hardword on battler one who struggles honestly for aliving bint girl blot posterior or anus  Anyonewho has surveyed the special language of a subgroupwill be aware of the problem of whether oneshould include only words specific to the subgroupThirtyfive obviously feels that these terms whichare not specific to the subgroup have assumed aspecial place in the argot or are used intensively inthe underworld or in prison  Hartley is also aware ofthe issue and he includes imbecile with the commentA common term of contempt in gaol usedparticularly of the warders  Rhyming slang is a featureof colloquial Australian English but it appearsto have been especially intensive in the underworldand in prisons at this time            A valuable feature of this book is Simesslengthy introduction devoted to The Literature ofCrime and The Language and Lexicography ofCrime  Simes traces crime literature from the firstbeggarbooks the German Die Betrugnisse der Gylerc  and Liber Vagatorum c  and similartexts from France Spain Italy and Englandthrough the criminal biography fictionalized accountsof crime and the underworld and finally thedetective novel  An interest in the language and lexicographybegins with the earliest texts which usuallyinclude glossaries or explanations of the speciallanguage of beggars thieves and so on  Simes givesa full account of these glossaries and then turns tothe development of dictionaries of underworld slangfrom the th century to the present  There is detailedattention to English American and Australianmaterial  This survey and its bibliographical materialwill prove an indispensable guide to any lexicographerinterested in underworld slang  The oneomission I note in the Autralian material is MarcusClarkes Sketches of Melbourne Low Life   TheLanguage of Bohemia which appeared in the Australasianin   This article gives a brief history ofunderworld slang and an extensive listing of underworldterms in use in Melbourne in the s            The scholarship that has gone into this book isexemplary and the book will appeal to the generalreader as much as to the lexicographer            Bruce Moore                           The University of New South Wales                                          The Story of Websters Third            At the time of publication of Websters ThirdNew International Dictionary  commonly referredto as Websters Third but in these pages forthe sake of brevity as MW or MWIII  I was directorof the reference department of Random Housepreparing what was later to be published as The RandomHouse Dictionary of the English Dictionary  UnabridgedEdition   It was therefore entirely inappropriatefor me to comment on either the MWIII itselfor the furor raised by its critics and supportersMore than three decades later I readily recall myopinions about both at the time opinions that havechanged little over the years there was no doubtthat the MWIII deserved criticism but those benightedselfappointed guardians of the languagewho were heaping vituperative imprecations on theDictionary and its editors were criticizing it for thewrong things            To be sure I agreedstill agreewith thosewho believe that the comment about aint  usedorally in most parts of the US by many cultivatedspeakers esp in the phrase aint I  was not reflectiveof the facts I knew many cultivated speakers inmost parts of the US and the only time I everheard them say aint was in jocular contexts or invirtual quotations like She aint what she used to be I must admit that my evidence was entirely impressionisticbut Gove provided no statistical supportfor his contention either  My chief criticisms howeverwere of a more general nature  The biggestwas that Gove had gone his merry way in producingwhat he considered to be a lexicon of the languagebut with little thought for those who were to use itno one could call the MWIII userfriendly certainlynot in  when as far as I know the expressionhad not yet gained currency              HEADWORDS  The practice of entering propernames and adjectives with lowercase initials I foundoffputting because they were normally encounteredwith capitals  To take a random example there issome question about the accuracy of description of aword like macedonian  it appears in six main entriesthe first three of which bear homograph numbersThe first belonging or relating to Macedonia has usu cap  as does the third a follower of thebishop Macedonius  but is there substantialenough evidence for these forms being spelled witha lowercase m to warrant such treatment  I doubtit  It is far more likely that the preponderance ofevidence would show that an entry with a capitalM mightconceivablywarrant a comment like rarely lower case   Only the second entry a nounincluding the senses natives or inhabitants descendantand languages shows  cap   WhereGoves researchers came up with such highly detailedinformation about the distribution of suchforms is hard to imagine  Certainly there is no principleinvolved in such a distribution  Of the othermain entries macedonian cry or macedonian callmacedonianpersian  and macedonian pine  eachshows  usu cap   As all of these entries are conventionallycapitalized in normal English it is difficult tofathom the rationale for the treatment and  CAPITALIZATION in the Explanatory Notes reveals nothinguseful              PRONUNCIATIONS  Another area of confusion forthe user is the treatment of pronunciation  While itmust be acknowledged that pronunciations occupy agreat deal of spaceowing largely to the dialectalvariants and the precision with which they are representedmostAmerican dictionaries are satisfiedto show major American dialect differences and torely on detailed variants to be the product of a judiciouslyselected key word in the pronunciation keya subject I do not have the space to go into hereBut the entry for investiture in MWIII shows for example            tchr ch  chr tt tty            I think that the inferior dash beginning the thirdpronunciation must be an error  Counting the internalvariations that is seven variants merely forthe last two syllables of the word to see how thefirst two are pronounced one must go to the precedingentry investitive   It does not get any better eitherIf you want to know how to pronounce homozygote all that is given is                        which is not only cryptically unhelpful but meansthat the user has to filter back five columns to seehow homowords are pronounced then on to zygoteto see how that is pronounced  In other manifestationsof this curious cumbersome style are                           nouakchott nwksht nw sh                            sadducean sn            Such information might be appropriate to a referencework for phoneticians dialectologists andother linguists but its usefulness and meaningfulnessin a dictionary for ordinary dictionary users isnot immediately apparent            Let me clarify what I take to be userfriendly ina dictionary most users pick up a dictionary occasionallyto check a spelling pronunciation definitionetymology or other information like usage and synonymyFor some occasionally means severaltimes a year for a few it means several times a weekOne can hardly expect to become steeped in the reconditestyle of a dictionary in such brief encountersespecially since they might well be for entirely differentpurposes  Thus it is userunfriendly of a dictionaryanyreference book in factto exhibit a styleso involved as to be virtually unassimilable save by adedicated experienced few except for the arcanadictionary style should be revealed transparently toanyone picking up the book and no one should berequired to take a course in dictionary navigation orto spend half an hour adjusting his eyes to read reamsof sixpoint type              DEFINITIONS  One of the most difficult areas toassess in a dictionary is the quality of its definitionsSeveral philosophies of defining prevailnot tooabstruse to go into in VERBATIM but a not entirelyappropriate aside hereand the style cleaved to byGove attempts an approach that is progressively restrictiveor expansive depending on the nature ofthe word defined  It works much of the time particularlyfor highly denotative ostensive objects but itcreates ludicrous results when applied to simplethings  One of the examples frequently cited of theworst reflexes of the style can be seen in the maindefinition of door  a a movable piece of firm material or astructure supported usu along one side andswinging on pivots or hinges sliding along agroove rolling up and down revolving as one offour leaves or folding like an accordion by meansof which an opening may be closed or kept openfor passage in or out of a building room or othercovered enclosure or a car airplane elevator orother vehicle b a similar part by which accessis prevented or allowed to the contents of a repositorycabinet vault or refrigeration or combustionchamber                        It is not difficult to understand how such a definitioncould be constructed from a collection of citationslips what is hard to see is how once it was writtensomeone who had any sensitivity for English styleand communication could have let it get into printAnother example occurs at hotel  a a house licensed to provide lodging andusu meals entertainment and various personalservices for the public  INN b a building ofmany rooms chiefly for overnight accommodationof transients and several floors served by elevatorsusu with a large open streetlevel lobbycontaining easy chairs with a variety of compartmentsfor eating drinking dancing exhibitionsand group meetings as of salesmen or conventionattendants with shops having both inside andstreetside entrances and offering for sale itemsas clothes gifts candy theater tickets traveltickets of particular interest to a traveler or providingpersonal services as hairdressing shoeshining and with telephone booths writing tablesand washrooms freely available                        One is tempted to comment on further amenitieseg free parking porters to carry ones luggageBgirls hookers house detectives and on furtherrestrictions there are few hotels in large cities thatmake washrooms freely available even to hotelguests outside their rooms lest some wretch needingto use the facility wander in off the street butwould anyone insist that the presence of shops berestrictively incorporated in the definition of hotel would a native speaker of English refer to restaurantsand other public rooms as compartments foreating drinking dancing etc  Indeed there is nodefinition of compartment in the MWIII that fits thesense to which it is stretched in the definition ofhotel             I could go on and on with other criticisms butthe purpose of this essay is to review Herbert Mortonsbook not the MWIII  regardless of temptationIn general Morton tells the story of Noah Websterand his legatees in a straightforward sympatheticbut not entirely unbiased manner  To be sure thefacts are present awry in only once instance whichI shall come to later  In most cases it would bedifficult without substantial knowledge to confutesome of the information presented  I knew Govenotwell I hasten to say but from Mortons accountneither did anyone else  I found him a ratherdour lugubrious individual and even the author ofWebsters Third finds it difficult to recount manytales exemplifying his humanity any a sense of humorIf sobersidedness make not an attractive manit certainly need not have affected Goves proficienciesas a lexicographer  But G  C Merriam asthe company was then styled was not Philip Goveand some of the less savory practices of that organizationssalesmen during the late salwaysvigorously denied as company policy by executivesinevitablyrubbed off on those who onehopes were innocent of such activities            Mortons history of the company is probablyreasonably accurate though one should note that itssources could scarcely be said to be unbiased mostbeing company records and either present or formeremployees  All the complimentary critiques are wellattended and quoted the adverse are given equaltime as it were but not treated with much respectAs I suggested above they should not be paid muchheed being either the result of misconception ignorancelack of understanding just plain bigotry andprejudice orsurely later on during the dictionarycontroversy of the sthe mere business of parrotingothers Webster bashing            Were I accorded the space allowed the authorof Websters Third to argue each point with which Itake issue this would not be a review but anotherbook and I have rambled from the main purposealready  Yet there is one bald misstatement of factin the book that cannot go unassailed  MortonwritesEspecially noteworthy was the  InternationalConference on Lexicography in English alandmark

only person associated with the conferencewho was a member before during and after it Iapproached the Executive Director of the NYAS EuniceThomas Miner suggesting a conference on lexicographyin English  At that time there was no recognitionin the Academy of the existence oflinguistics which fell somewhere among the variouspsychology and sociology stools  I was turned downbut not entirely discouraged and decided to returnto the fray several years later when I had more time            I approached the Academy again after leavingRandom House in  and the climate and directorshiphaving changed received more encouragementStill it was made clear to me that because Iwas not on the staff of a college or university Ishould have to find someone who was and whowould support my case  I got in touch with FredericG Cassidy of the University of Wisconsin nowwidely known as the editor of the Dictionary ofAmerican Regional English  whom I had known inthe early s  Cassidy came to New York and metwith the board and me  It subsequently developedthat he was too busy to take on the burdens of thechairmanship of the conference but suggested McDavidwhom I knew as I had engaged him in theearly s as a consultant to the Random HouseDictionary   McDavid agreed to become involvedcame to New York and brought Audrey Duckert ofAmherst Massachusetts into the picture as his associate            Thereafter I worked closely with the NYAS togain the participation of linguists and lexicographersin the United States and abroad and to further thepurpose of the conference  In McDavids

Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on HistoricalPrinciples            First let us look at the statistics as presentedon the back of the dustjacket of the New ShorterNSOED   definitions  headwords million words  variant spellings illustrative quotations  sources of quotationsincluding VERBATIM and  individual authorsamong which appears the name of your proud editorAmerican dictionaries based their counts onentries a generously defined arbitrarily artificialterm cooked up between the G  C Merriam Companyand the US Treasury Department during thes when that governmental department was responsiblefor purchasing a function now performedby the General Services Administration  An entry inUS commercial dictionary parlance means everyheadword that is main entry set flush left often inlarger boldface type every inflected form everyrunon entry the selfevident boldface words consistingof the headword plus a productive endinglike  tion   ly   ness  etc list words those beginningwith a common prefix of transparent meaning like                           inter  re  un  etc that are merely listed at theirapproximate alphabetical place without definitionsor other lexicographical information every variantcounted only once and every change in a part ofspeech  In a typical college dictionary which mighthave say  headwords the entry count whichis prominently displayed in the jacket blurbs isabout twice that or   In the US publishersdo not generally advertise the number of definitionsin their dictionaries but flaunt their entry counts  Ata rough guess the NSOED contains about such entries or some twenty per cent fewer thanthe Random House Unabridged  RHDU  the populardictionary nearest in size            It must be stressed however that although theNSOED might include fewer headwordsit has nobiographical and geographical entries for exampleitgenerally accords each entry fuller treatmentThere are as we shall see other differencesbut on the most superficial level one might observethat the NSOED offers more information aboutfewer words which may well prove an enticementto those who already have a largish dictionary eventhe RHDU             Although the Preface describes the content andprovenance of this new edition it is disappointingthat no statement of purpose no fundamental linguisticor lexicographic principle is anywhere setforth  Reference is made to the OED  of course butthe present work could scarcely be said to reflectthe same philosophies  Notable is the term illustrative used to describe the quotations accompanyingthe definitions aside from their mixed success inserving to illustrate quotations served a somewhatdifferent purpose in the OED and indeed in theirapplication in some other dictionaries they werethe source matrix from which the definitions werederived            It is worth reminding ourselves that the NSOEDis a British dictionary although that might not be aparticularly intrusive factor in its use for variantspellings have been given ample coverage  But itdoes affect the pronunciations which given in thesymbols of the International Phonetic Alphabet areas usual for British dictionaries for the prestige dialectcalled Received Pronunciation  RP   In RP Athanasianis pronounced an while Americanswould pronounce the final syllable curiously that is shown as a variant pronunciationunder Asian Asiarch and Asiatic and it is hard tosee why it was omitted from Athanasian  perhapsthe NSOED editors have the inside skinny a sensethat is in along with solid coverage of other neologismsslang and standard  It is not made clear whythe standard IPA transcriptions ai or ai was notused for the vowel sound in I why might  etc theNSOED shows             As in other British dictionaries headwords arenot syllabified so one cannot use dictionaries inEngland to determine where a word may be conventionallyhyphenated  Typesetters in England seem toknow that the words England and English are sohyphenated a practice that has eluded many Americancompositors and proofreaders including thoseworking for some of the best publishers  In theearly s  I devised what I thought was a usefulsystem for showing syllabification of boldface wordsin the Collins English Dictionary places where hyphenscould occur were marked by a tiny plus signexcept for spelling hyphens which always permittedendofline hyphens places that marked syllablebreaks but where hyphenation was avoidedwere marked by a centered dotpity city motherinlaw etcphonemics determination intercityetc                        The Collins is a British dictionary but despite thefact that some compositors clambered over one anotherto acquire the computerized lists of suchwords showing the breaks others paid the informationlittle heedparticularly Collins Publishersand the marks were omitted entirely from the SecondEdition of their dictionary            Preferred American convention is naturallynot reflected in the text of entries British spellingobtains  But the preferred American convention ofwriting as two words an adverbadjective combinationwhen the adverb ends in  ly is also violatedBritish practice calls for widelyspread closelyrelatedwhich appear under Athapaskan  whilestandard practice in the US would write these as twowords hyphenating only modifying adverbs notending in  ly  wellknown wellthoughtof easygoing These rules change if the combination appearsin predicative position  Elsewhere Briticismsmight be felt to intrude in definitions with wordslike dustman dockporter  etc appearing here andthere  Differences of a more serious nature occurwhen definers use words less familiar than the entrybeing defined roastingjack for mechanical spittenuity for thinness invest for award are a fewexamples  Not all US variants are entered for examplegreenkeeper is an entry but greenskeeper  theAmerican form is nowhere to be found  As mentionedthe pronunciations are British the variantpronunciation of controversy  in which the stress ison the shortened second syllable is shown butthat is not heard in the US neither is the given pronunciationof intermediary  which ends  inBE

smacks of a spellingpronunciation to an AE speaker the pronunciationrespt standard in AE is only a variant in BE butone I have never heard            Emphasis in definitions seems sometimes askewinterloper   A person who meddles in anothersbusiness esp for profit an intruder                        The problem here is in the use of business  in a definitionone would expect the literal sense not themore colloquial sense of affairs as met with inmind your own business none of your business  etcYet if one applies that criterion the definition is toonarrow particularly with the emphasized mentionof profit and it would have been more accurateto have put the general sense an intruder first            It must be noted that definitions are ordered historicallyas the title of the NSOED implies not byfrequency  Thus the first definition of interlude refersto a short dramatic piece performed between theacts of the miracle plays and the common modernsense of interval is not met with till definition That is merely a factmany American dictionariesfollow the same theme notably the MWIII             Were space available many other strengths andweaknesses of the NSOED could be enumerated indetail but it would be more useful to offer an overallassessment and to suggest where this dictionarymight fit into a library personal or institutional  TheNSOED is an impressive extremely usable dictionaryfor those sophisticated enough to know how touse it by which I mean not only Americans thosewho have an earlier edition would be well served toreplace it with this one  Also the preceding commentsleveled against coverage of American Englishshould in no way affect those who care little abouthow Americans use the language for in many respectsthe NSOED is simply a superior dictionary  Imust express a prejudice however for the benefit ofall who have a personal computer with a CDROM andwho have the wherewithal to acquire the OEDe onCDROM there is nothing like it in terms of ease ofaccess speed convenience as compared with hoistingone or more volumes of the OEDe or NSOEDevery time one wants to look something up  Forcasual use it would be extravagant to go to such anexpense but for anyone who does even the mostinformal research into the lexicon of English theCDROM version is essential and indispensable certainlyno library in the world has any excuse for nothaving it            The problems of binding a page book areformidable but it can be done and I believe thatOUP customers would have been better served bybeing offered a onevolume edition perhaps with aneeded lectern of its own enabling the NSOED tocompete more readily with the other main contendersamong large dictionaries the MWIII and theRandom House Unabridged             Laurence Urdang

recent establishment ofa new radio station Classic FM Radio  the longstandingBBC station that has broadcast classical musicfor many years has not been replaced by thiscommercial parvenu but it should be noted that Radio broadcasts classical music while the new stationis engaged in a different enterprise  Not only isClassic music not always classical but there is anutter lack of sensitivity in the

Britain and presumably has hadEnglish names as long as the language has been spokenin the British Isles  However primrose is a relativelyrecent name for the flower being first recordedonly in the th century and no Old Englishname for it is known  It is possible that before theth century both the primrose and the cowslip Primula veris  were regarded as one and the sameand called cowslips Old English cuslippe   Sincewhere the two species grow near to each other theyhybridize freely giving rise to intermediate formsthe need for two names might not have been apparentin earlier times            The word primrose is often believed to be derivedfrom the Latin prima rose first rose There ishowever an alternative derivation since in MiddleEnglish earlier than the first record of primrose  theplant was known as primerole or saynt peterwortePrimerole probably derives from the Old Frenchprimier first with the diminutive suffix  ole  implyingsmallness            The remarkable ability of most species of Primulato hybridize with ease whenever they meet hasfurther confused the English names of the primroseand its close relatives  The hybrid between theprimrose and the cowslip  Primula veris x vulgaris sometimes called Primula variabilis  is known as theoxlip   Usually it is called the common oxlip becauseit occurs quite frequently but purists prefer to call itthe false oxlip since there is a third species Primulaelatior  now found only in the eastern counties ofEngland which is for them the true oxlip   To addto the confusion the true oxlip is also known as thepaigle  a name which in the past has been ratherindiscriminately applied to several wildflowers includingbuttercups  In some country areas of Englandpaigle or pagle  or pagyll  is still the local namefor the cowslip  It may be derived from the OldEnglish paegle or paegel winecup  This would bemost appropriate since around the time paigle cameinto use cowslip blooms were used to make a verypopular country wine

of the English lexiconfor it was thought unnecessary to provide definitionsand other information about words familiarto anyone who spoke English  Nowadays of courseit is felt that a general dictionary ought to describethe lexicon of the language as far as space permitswhich is why modern dictionaries devote so muchspace to entries for words like the a and run jump and play             The entries in Endangered can be dividedroughly into two classes those one knows and thoseone does not  Among the latter are some engagingterms that word lovers are likely to add to their writingor drop into casual cocktailparty conversationsand in some instances might actually fill aneed  My favorites among these which are notfound in the present work are tally and leman which mean a person with whom one cohabits withoutbenefit of matrimony  The struggle thatspawned POSSLQ significant other partner  and othermiscegenations and ennuiisms could have beenavoided by resurrecting these terms though leman owing to its  man ending might not make it throughthe stultifying morass of todays political correctness            Many of the rare words in the book are synonymsthat have dropped out of the language for onereason or another the main one being that theywere not used  For many it might be impossible tofind evidence for their existence outside the singlequotation in the OED or similar source and theymight have been nonce coinages  Their rarity is attributableto what linguists refer to as the economyof language  which is akin to the physical law statingthat two objects cannot occupy the same space atthe same time  Most of the time two or morewords that appear to be pure synonyms semanticallytend to diverge in application or distributioneg windpipetrachea  in frequency eg niveoussnowy lutaceousmuddy  or in connotation  maternalmotherly This matter is discussed at somelength in the Introduction to my Oxford Thesaurus             Notwithstanding many people derive enjoymentfrom wallowing in peculiar curious and unfamiliarwords which often provide a source ofamusement  The selection of such words is likely tobe personal reflecting the tastes and proclivities ofthe compiler hence one is hard put to quarrel withthe choices  These and other factors are well setforth by the author in his Preface  It is important tomention that all words in Endangered are pronouncedusing the Moo Goo Gai Pan system all areaccorded succinct clear definitions and all are providedwith example contexts            In the last hundred pages of Endangered an attemptis made at a reverse dictionary yielding amore or less elaborate index to the dictionary sectionSuch reverse dictionaries as exist  BernsteinsReverse Dictionary having been a popular examplefor many years work well for those users whoseword sense coincides with that of the compiler  TedBernsteins book never worked well for me but Imight not be a fair touchstone in such matters  InGrambss book the singleword synonyms workfairly well but as elsewhere the system breaksdown when trying to anticipate where a user oughtto look to find a word not everyone is likely tochoose the same reverse concept  The problemhas been anticipated by using more than one synonymand by providing entries under both  For examplelaziness or sluggishness  SEGNITY appearsboth under laziness and sluggishness thicklippedLABROSE appears also under lips having thick   Stillno system could work perfectly for all users            Those who enjoy word playwhich includescertain puzzle solvers who seem to need all the helpthey can find that is not already provided by dictionariesspecial puzzlers reference books thesaurusesetcshould find Endangered a useful welcome additionto their libraries  Those who simply harbor anabiding affection for the language and like havingfun with it will want to acquire the book for delectablebrowsing            Laurence Urdang                              Medical Consultant  in a growing companywhich manages medical
