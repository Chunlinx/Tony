                                 Creationism Evolves            Themedia have been in an uproar this month over the latest putative outbreak ofcreationism Kansas Votes to Delete Evolution From States ScienceCurriculum shrieked the New York Times  Liberals thought the steadyunearthing of fossils the decline of organized religion and several adversecourt decisions had rendered creationism extinct Instead adversity has madecritics of evolution stronger It has forced them to develop themes andarguments better suited to the new environment                                           Censorship The conventional wisdom put out byevolutionists and picked up by the media is that the Kansas Board of Educationrejected eliminated and expunged evolution from its curriculum NBCsToday show said Kansas had banned evolution The Timesspeculated that school districts might force teachers to dispute evolution orteach creationism In phrasing questions about the controversy severalreporters characterized the issue as censoring evolution            Whatthe Kansas board actually did was remove evolution from the list of subjects onwhich the state will test students While liberals call this censorshipconservatives spin it as an affirmation and exercise of freedom The safestdodge adopted by every major Republican presidential candidate is that stateand local leaders should be allowed to choose their own curricula Republicansalso argue that parents should decide such matters Ill trust the parentsmore than I will bureaucracies proclaimed Steve Forbes            Hardcore creationists have mounted a more aggressive libertariancounterattack In TV interviews since the Kansas decision Jerry Falwell hasdeplored the bad old days when the government forced creationism on kidsNow says Falwell the government is forcing evolution on them Otherspokesmen for creationism accuse evolutionist censors and bookburners ofsuppressing evidence for creation science Falwell constantly invokesacademic freedom pleading that schools should teach both evolution andcreationism as theories and trust the children with their parents to arriveat their own conclusions When CNNs Wolf Blitzer asked Gary Bauer whetherKansas should be allowed to ban evolution Bauer replied What Kansas didwas allow both views to be presented  That is consistent with America andour free discussion of things            Toprotect creationism from censors conservatives have adopted the relativismand multiculturalism of the left Falwell argues that all models or theoriesshould be taught on equal footing George W Bush agrees Children ought tobe exposed to different theories about how the world started Steve Forbessays the facts of prehistory are all up in the air now A lot of what wethought was true turns out to be not true Theres a raging debate So Ileave it to local decisions Fox News commentator Sean Hannity pleads fortolerance and prochoice education If some school districts can haveebonics I think others can talk about creationism argues CNNs TuckerCarlson There is room for all ideas                                           Meaning Liberal pundits eager to pick a fight withthe religious right attack the notion of pairing religious instruction withthe teaching of scientific evolution They accuse creationists of violatingthe wall of church and state by imposing a religious theory on the seculareducational system Its all part of the culture war over sex education andother school controversies they scoff            Thismay be good constitutional law but its lousy politics According to GallupPolls  percent of Americans believe in evolution but only  percent acceptit as a purely secular account The other  percent within the  percentthink God has guided evolution toward human development And while only percent want to banish evolution from the schools and teach creationisminstead  percent think both ideas should be taught The bottom line is thatif evolutionists force the public to choose between evolution and religion orbetween evolution and divine creation theyll lose            Creationists recognizing this equation try to force precisely this choiceThey dig up quotes in which evolutionary theorists espouse atheism and scorndivine intervention A recent Wall Street Journal oped titled TheChurch of Darwin called evolution the main scientific prop for a philosophyof materialism that denies Gods existence In TV interviews Bauer rigs thedebate by juxtaposing the idea that we descended from monkeys with the ideathat we are divinely made and are creatures of God Evolution impliesthere is no divine intelligence involved he told reporters last weekLikewise Dan Quayle attributed the uproar over creationism to a hostileenvironment against religion            Conversely creationists broaden the appeal of their own theory by associatingit with the general idea of divine intervention and intelligent designWhereas theres no meaning in life if were just animals in a struggle forsurvival they argue If we can teach creation there is an order there is aplan You have a place in this world On the deepest and most decisive levelthis spin has been an enormous success While privately scorning creationismthe media have thoughtlessly absorbed and promoted the creationists dichotomybetween God and Darwin The day of the Kansas decision CBS News posed thequestion this way Are human beings divine creations or the product of eons ofevolution            Wiserevolutionists know that the better approach is to pose a choice not betweenscience and religion but between literalism and interpretation While mostpeople want to believe that God created us one way or another few can swallowthe literal creationist reading of the Bible which holds that the earth isless than  years old Never mind the strictest reading which supposesthat creation took a week The first theory is flexible enough to withstandfossil evidence but the second isnt When asked about the Bibles literalaccount of creation as opposed to the attractive concept of divinecreation every major Republican presidential candidateeven Bauerhassquirmed ducked and tried to steer the discussion back to faith moralsand the general idea that humans were created in the image of God The smartstrategy for evolutionists in short is to embrace theism and shift the debateto dinosaur bones                                           Elitism Scientists and liberal commentators love toridicule creationists for going back to the  th century turningkids into scientific ignoramuses and secondguessing experts and theSupreme Court There is no alternative to evolution asserted Barry Lynnexecutive director of Americans United for the Separation of Church and Stateduring a recent Fox News debate There isnt really anything on the otherside On the Today show an evolutionist professor scoffed at theKansas boards decision Only in education would an elected board of laypeople decline to take the advice of a committee of experts            Creationists have learned to jujitsu the scornful tone and overreaching scopeof these pronunciations Responding on Today to the professors crackabout lay people the chair of the Kansas board observed Many parents Ivetalked to believe that they know what is best for their children This attitudeof evolutionists has been characteristic of some parts of the educationcommunity that only they know what is best for kids Bauer and othercreationists accuse the evolutionist elite of trampling popular values anddefying the American tradition that the people have a right to disagree withthe experts            Theconventional populist critique of evolution identifies it with sex educationcondom distribution restrictions on school prayer and other perceived liberalattacks on religion But as the public places its faith less in orthodoxy andmore in the marketplace of ideas creationists are developing a hardier strainof populism that appeals to progressive concepts such as questionsskepticism and investigation Rather than defend religious dogma theypoke holes in evolutionary dogma scrutinizing the theorys missing links andthe mathematical probability of the emergence of complex life Schools shouldteach the evidence  that raises questions about how thoroughly evolutionexplains everything argues Bill Kristol            Thisappeal to skepticism seems likely to flourish The creationists had only fiveof the six seats they needed on the Kansas board to remove evolution from therequired curriculum They got the sixth vote by persuading a noncreationistboard member that evolution should be presented as a theory rather than as afact Before we start sneering at Kansas writes liberal columnist LarsErikNelson We might look askance at the supposed scientists and social scientistswho defend their own pet theories such as global warming free tradesupplyside economics  with a religiouslike zeal denouncing all doubters aseither heretics or illeducated bumpkins            Creationism it turns out is a case study in the evolution of spin Theenvironment changes the idea mutates and new strains and arguments take holdIs it natural selection or intelligent design You decide
