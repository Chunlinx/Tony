                                 Theme Party            For mostof this century its been a routine British sneer that Americans have no senseof irony Bob Doles poll numbers may finally be proving the Brits right Dolehas run the most ironic postmodern presidential campaign ever seenstartingwith his campaign theme song the only conceivable purpose of which is to serveas an ironic negation of everything campaign themes are meant to do  is atakeoff on the s hit Im a Soul Man and its most immediate quality isthat its so unDole Its a parodic campaign song Dole obviously has neverheard of it any more than hes heard of Tupac Shakur or those other gangstarappers his advisers periodically call on him to denounce Then againconsidering that  percent of all pop songs are genderneutral though PatBuchanan toyed with You Cant Get a Man With a Gun the number seems to havebeen especially picked for the blithe insouciance it shows toward the Dolecampaigns gender gap What do they do for a second chorus Im a DoleChick More ironic is that the song is an exquisite musicalization of thecandidates most frequently cited defect his campaigns lack of any centraltheme Dole Man isnt about anything at all You cant blame Dole for havingtrouble staying on message when the only message of his song is that youshould stand around twitching                           Im aDole ManNananana nanaIm a Dole ManNana nana Repeat untilfade            Sam Dave sang the song back in the s and Sam gave the campaign permission touse it I forget how Dole voted on the  revisions to Title  of the USCode but it clearly never registered with him that in pop songs copyrightbelongs to the copyright holderin this case the recording companynot to therecording artists One of the songs writers objected to Dole Man therecording company backed him up and Sams permission proved to be irrelevantSo much for Doles line that though he may not have a lot of fancy words hesa legislator and knows how things work            Compare all that with Clinton in  who went on the stumpto a that suited him perfectly Yes thats a cruel thing to say about anybodybut the point is that it was a plausible soundtrack to his campaign                           DontstopThinking about tomorrowDont stopItll soon be here                        Thisquatrain distills brilliantly both the vapidity and ruthless singlemindednessof the Clinton administration We cant say we werent warned            For a campaign song thats pithy you have to go back to and the satirical musical Of Thee I Sing  in which John PWintergreen campaigns for the White House with a powerful slogan A Vote forWintergreen Is a Vote for Wintergreen and a by the Gershwins of just fourlines                           Wintergreen for presidentWintergreen for presidentHes the man the peoplechooseLoves the Irish and the Jews                        Unfortunately the strategy wasnt so successful the second time around In thesequel Let Em Eat Cake  John P Wintergreen runs forreelection and is defeated by John P Tweedledee with his                                        Hes the man thecountry seeksLoves the Turks and the Greeks                        Ira Gershwin was much better at spoof campaign songs thanthe real thing In the s he reworked It Aint Necessarily So for AdlaiStevenson and included the first sung reference to a vicepresidentialcandidate Lil Nixon was small but oh myHis office expenses were high aswell as Love Is Sweeping the Country also from Of Thee I Sing                            Adlaissweeping the countryHe will be the next prezWell be leaningOn words withmeaningFor he means every word he says                        Its funnyhow hard it is to find anything to sing about Most presidential elections inthe republics history have had specially commissioned themes Teddy ComeBack WilsonThats All Franklin D Roosevelts Back Again Nixons theOne But it wouldnt have made any difference if theyd been Wilsons theOne Theodore Roosevelts Back Again FranklinThats All and NixonCome Back            As if to concede the John P WintergreenJohnP Tweedledee interchangeability most campaigns eventually settled for anINSERT NAME OF CANDIDATE HERE approach shoehorning their man into thehandiest existing song In  I asked Sammy Cahn if hed been pressed intoservice Funny you should mention that he said but I got a call from somefriends in Boston who are backing a fellow called Dukakis So I wrote My Kindof Guy Dukakis Is             A bit tricky to rhymeDukakis is            Suresaid Sammy but theres always a way around When Kennedy asked me if he coulduse  I realized his name didnt fit any part of the tune Where can you putit                           Justwhat makes the little old ant Think hell move a rubbertree plantEvryoneknows an antCant Move a rubbertree plantBut hes got high hopes                        So instead of that Ispelled it out                           KEdoubleNEDYJacks the nations favorite guyEvryone wants to back JackJackJack ison the right trackAnd hes got high hopes                        When I subsequently encountered Dukakis it seemed highlyunlikely that he could be Cahns or many other folks kind of guyand ofcourse he wasnt particularly Cahn was simply plying his trade Im asongwriter and I play straight down the middle Sinatra asked me to do a lyricfor Spiro Agnew so I did Amazingly the guy who wrote Call MeIrresponsible and All the Way insisted that the song he wrote to mark EdMeeses first year as Attorney General was one of his best lyrics ever            Perhaps one day the DickMorrises and Ed Rollinses will find it easier to pick candidates who alreadyhave the names of popular songs Watching the shamelessly bogus populist Lamar Lamar  Alexander walking across New Hampshire accompanied bycampaign workers in immaculately pressed plaid shirts theyd clearly changedinto in the mens room at Manchester airport you began to wonder if thecandidate himself wasnt just Lamar Schmoe whod changed his name just so hecould use Alexanders Ragtime Band as his theme song            Should all else fail thecandidate can always resort to the theme from  which on the basis of noscientific evidence is credited with mystical powers to transform any flaggingcampaign Bob Dole has been using it in his postDole Man phase In facing similar difficulties Ted Kennedy switched from Aaron Coplands Fanfarefor the Common Man too hightoned to Gonna Fly Now the theme fromRocky Ted as the plucky little underdog As we all know he swept to afantastic victory that
