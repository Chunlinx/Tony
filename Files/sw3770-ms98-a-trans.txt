                 well i was just wondering if you had had any experience with um the care of the elderly   yes i have in fact uh just a little over just a little less than a year ago uh my mother went to be with the Lord and we cared for her the last uh oh seventeen months of her life here in the at home   uhhuh   aside from uh having to uh take her to the hospital and uh you know those times well she was there in the the regular hospital   right   and then she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer and so the doctor elected to have her uh finish out uh in the hospice program     umhum   and uh i as far as im concerned that is far and above any nursing home because uh shes around her own family you know the the elderly parent in question is around their own family the uh hospice program provides a hospital type bed well it is a hospital bed and all the oxygen stuff and a uh and a visiting nurse at least every other day et cetera et cetera et cetera     well thats nice   and its all taken care of by by uh Medicare uh and uh it its its really neat uh and i you know i wouldnt i wouldnt banish uh my old loved one to a to a warehouse   no   and thats thats what i basically uh view a nursing home as a warehouse so  thats     its really sad   pardon me   its really a sad situation   uhhuh no   and uh i think a lot of people struggle with   oh   uh i guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever you know the parent is   umhum   doesnt always want the inlaw living in the house is that right   right   well thats really sad   yeah i know but uh in this case uh spouse and i uh are uh were are are are uh united in this area because i guess her father her grandfather and grandmother both lived with uh   umhum   her parents uh their their their golden years to so   umhum   this isnt like uh uh just one one uh instance in fact uh her uh uh experiences were were invaluable to me   umhum   uh  in fact i dont know if i could have uh held up uh you know without my wife uh helping in this this this case   right yes well i know when the i remember being a child and my grandmother had had  several several strokes and things and that we had my parents tried to keep her in the house and they did for a long time i couldnt tell you how long until she got uh where she had to have complete care   uhhuh uhhuh   and just they couldnt you know keep her in the house anymore and it was really hard on everyone that she had to have you know twenty four hour a day care and i dont remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at that time just a block or two from our house   umhum umhum   and that um they put her there and we all went just constantly until she died   oh okay   but it was very hard on everyone to see well you know grandmother be like that and i dont know that you know  i dont being so young i dont remember why   umhum   you know what was why she had to go there   well maybe uh uh well as as you say the the care of of grandmother or was was to such that such mom and dad couldnt handle it   umhum well i do remember that she was you know totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way and that that they couldnt they found that they could not you know give her   oh boy yeah uhhuh   the hygienic care and everything that she needed   uhhuh well then then theres almost then theres almost no no uh uh choice left to her then   no but like you say there is a tendency for people to be abandoned though you know in the nursing home i do remember the other patients there um   uhhuh   being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother because they got some interaction with someone   right in fact just to just to sit and chat with them for five minutes and and be interested in what they have to say regardless of what it is   umhum right right and i guess thats hard on people to give give up their lives if theyre busy they dont you know its easy to abandon people because we do have the nursing homes i guess   umhum right   if you can afford them but anyway well im glad it worked out good for your family   and then and oh yeah it did and i was just praised i just praised the Lord that that we were able to uh have uh uh be
