                                 Night Courts            Its a courtroom so secureand austere it wouldnt look out of place in Mission Impossible Located on the sixth floor of the Justice Departments headquarters inWashington DC its double doors swing shut and seal themselves to the wallwhen a button nearby is depressed an oddly textured ceiling looms overheadOutside its doors the seals of intelligence agencies adorn the walls            Its judge doesnt sitbehind the bench raised above plaintiffs and defendants to symbolize hisauthority Instead he joins the witnesses and lawyers from the intelligenceagencies and the Justice Department at a single conference table No defenseattorneys ever join these proceedings            It tookCongress more than  years to establish this secret courtthe ForeignIntelligence Surveillance Act Courtand less than  years to craft a secondin its mold The new tribunala k a the removal courtwas created in Aprilas part of the AntiTerrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of  with thegoal of easing the deportation of legal aliens whom the government suspects ofmaterially supporting terrorist groups but who have committed no crimes            The creation of this supersecret court which is likely toshare FISA Court space was largely ignored in the debate over thecounterterrorism bill and underreported by the press The government claimsthat it needs the removal court to protect national security in sensitivedeportation cases against suspected alien terrorists It argues that publiclydisclosing key evidence as normal courts require can expose and endanger itsintelligence sources and that the unspeakable alternative is to allowsuspected terrorists to remain in the country            These two covert courtsdepart from Americas open legal culture and endow the judicial branch with alevel of secrecy more typical of the executive than the courts Justiceofficials bristle at the charge that the secret courts also carve out a defacto nationalsecurity exemption to both the Fourth Amendments prohibition ofwarrantless surveillance and the Fifth Amendments guarantees of dueprocess            Thatswhy civilliberties activists are crying foul at the new venue saying that theonly thing the removal court will remove is constitutional protections foraliens who engage in politically unpopular speech            The mechanics of the new stealth court are simpleGovernment attorneys will present classified evidence in secret to aremovalcourt judge one of five federal district judges serving on the courtat any one time If convinced that a proposed deportee is a terrorist thejudge will authorize the Justice Department to initiate deportation proceedingsagainst the alien in a district court where it will introduce as much secretevidence as it sees fit The defendant will not know he has been targeted fordeportation during removalcourt proceedings and when the case reaches thedistrict court he will see only a sketchy summary of the evidence against himThe district court then will decide whether the alien should be deported            TheJustice Department insists that removalcourt procedures will be invoked onlyin extreme cases where national security would be damaged by the publicdisclosure of deportation evidence But modifying judicial processes toaccommodate the executive branch risks upsetting the traditional role of thecourts as a check on executive power            Civil libertarians worry that the trend toward secretcourts begs for abuse by intelligence agencies because judges seem incapable ofturning government requests down Indeed ever since the FISA Court wasestablished in  to approve secret warrants for surveillance of suspectedspies Justice has won approval for all its  surveillance requests FISAhearings to cite one example approved the surveillance used in the Sheik OmarAbdel Rahman investigation The appeals court the FISA Court of Review hasnever even had to convene Perhaps the cloakanddagger ambience and absence ofan advocate for the surveillance target persuade otherwise skeptical judges togive credence to government security claims Whatever FISAs faults itsbetter than the previous federal wiretapping policy that permitted the attorneygeneral to authorize nationalsecurity wiretaps with no judicial review            Are thesecret courts constitutional Probably A host of legally significantdistinctions separates aliens from citizens and nationalsecurityinvestigations from lawenforcement probes The Supreme Court has never ruledon FISA and it did not overturn a McCarthyera statute which like the removalcourt was used to deport noncriminal aliens based on their politicalaffiliations            But these legal arguments are pedantries to many Arabs andIrish residing in the United States who fear they will be unjustly targetedunder the new statute And they dont calm civil libertarians who fear theFISA Court is a mere rubber stamp for executive power            Government lawyers mightnot lie about the facts says Kate Martin of the Center for National SecurityStudies But they draft the applications in a way to say that these facts meetthe requirements and by the time the application reaches the court it isunlikely that the court really gets to notice deficiencies            Officials at the Justice Department and FISA Court deny that the latter is arubber stamp attributing Justices winning percentage to rigorous internalreview that weeds out bad applications before theyre filed Thats howpresiding FISA Judge Royce Lamberth feels There might be a concern that theJustice Department has been too conservative in what they are presenting to thecourt if were approving every one he says            But the public doesnt have many independent guaranteesthat the courts are applying tough scrutiny to the governments applicationsSecrecy prevents open investigation of the courts methods and standards thereis a paucity of serious journalistic coverage of the courts and congressionaloversight of the courts is limited to the review in closed session ofclassified reports The only public indication that FISA plays fair comes fromfederal courts In their review of several FISA applications in the context ofcriminal cases they have yet to indicate that a FISA warrant was improperlygranted            I understand that itshard for people who dont see the process Deputy Attorney General JamieGorelick said of FISA in  Were not at liberty to make the kind ofdisclosures that I agree would make the public more comfortable            Secret courts requiregreat faith that the Justice Departmentand future Justice Departmentswillact with integrity In the absence of more openness nobody outside thenationalsecurity establishment will know how much freedom the secret courtstructures really cost
