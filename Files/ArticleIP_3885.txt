                       Get Meto the Church on Time                        There are several odd thingsin Sanda Kaufmans letter EMail to the Editors Oct  but the most striking is herreference to Israel as the mother country If as she has said there are million Jews how many are from Israel and how many in Israel were born thereThe area is the mother country to some peoplethe Palestinians who were therebefore and during the invasion by Europeans and Americans If they areembattled it is like the old days in the West with the invaders surrounded intheir forts by the Indians to whom the region belonged We now know that theIndians were right and that the real terrorists were the invading whitepopulations            Howeverthe main questions are mixed marriage and religion To even speak of mixedmarriage reveals a certain racism There is no such thing as a mixedmarriage because there is only one human race A mixed marriage would be witha dog or a sheep or some other species And as for religions in our day andage they should be forgotten except as interesting historical artifacts Thesooner we are done with all these superstitions including Judaism the betteroff mankind will be Why do some people still think we should follow theignorant ideas of mostly illiterate sheepherders who lived  or more yearsago             Joss Randall                                       YourPoint is Moooooooooooot                        In the article Hamburger Hyper DavidMastio suggests that Hudson Foods is not at fault in the E coli spaz Andwhile I would agree that the whole incident was overplayed after finishing thearticle Im left to conclude that Mastio is blaming  the cattle            Actually I suppose he issuggesting that the farmersranchers are to blame since it is during theirstewardship that the bacteria are contracted Mastio says that  percent to percent of US livestock are infected According to Mastio the real problemis that the cattle have E coli to begin with and that the cattle are fed tooclose to slaughter time causing their stomachs to burst during slaughter            Blaming this problem on thefarmer is nothing less than biting the hand that feeds First E coli infectsmuch more than  percent to  percent of livestock So withholding infectedcattle is much easier said than done But more importantly E colicontamination occurs when fecal matter comes in contact with meatConsequently the cause of the contamination must occur at slaughter time noton the farm            I do agree with Mastiosgeneral premise that Hudson is not fundamentally to blame The fault lies withAmericas appetite for abundant and inexpensive food Americans in generalmuch more than people from other countries have lost the connection betweenfood and health We eat without thought to the consequences and expect themedical industry to drop us a pill for our ills many of which are the resultof poor nutrition            We have industrialized ourfood systems and continue to do so something which classic economics says isnot possible since economies of scale do not easily apply to food productionYet we seem to desire cheap and anonymous food Rather than our food beinghandled by the farmer it passes through the processing and distributionsystem being handled packed unpacked rehandled packed again transportedunpacked and displayed and on and on It is a good system for dealing withdeodorant but it is simply not a good system for dealing with food            Theanswer as pointed out in the same Newsweek article Mastio mentions isfor consumers to rely more on locally produced food and to be willing tosupport farmers and pay more for high quality safe food             Jeff Bump MadisonWis                           Resistance is Feudal                        Regarding Jacob WeisbergsTax Evasion Of course there is a case against the IRSit is afeudal institution that has been continued despite the fact that we are nolonger subjects of the king and thus ought not to be forced to pay for theprivilege of working for a living That was the lot of serfs who were nearlyowned by their lords and whose land was owned by their lords            What weought to do to fund the proper functions of government is to charge contractand user fees These would be plenty to support a government that operateswithin its proper scope The fact that you folks find all this bizarre is notdifferent from Europeans finding private ownership of television or telephonecompanies bizarre several years ago             Tibor RMachan                                       WhatsBlack and White and Read All Over                        Randall Kennedy was verysmooth and subtle as he laid waste to Stephan and Abigail ThernstromsAmerica in Black and White in The Glass Is Not HalfFull I particularly liked the way he worked the book through thepessimistoptimist grinder            I was amused that theThernstroms start off with a few statistics to initiate their optimism in theirDialogue withKennedy This annoyed my liberal heart just enough to want to hear more fromthem            I wouldappreciate at some juncture that they drop the highteaandgloves Victorianismand come clean as to their political alliances In a world of Crossfire it is so obvious and boring to have interlocutors priss around their hiddenagendas weave intellectually dishonest tapestries and lob
