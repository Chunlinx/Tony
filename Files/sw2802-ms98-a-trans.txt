                 okay   so what do you think is the major cause   well i i definitely think its our the cars we drive and   yeah   i think you know everyone has good intentions and and thinks well i should carpool and i will and but that we just have so many different interests and so many different things we have to do its its a bother to have to pick somebody up and if you have a doctors appointment or something and they have to get another ride home or   right     you have to arrange its just a hassle and i guess were not willing to do that   yeah   but that to me is probably the thing that needs to be done or to start using public   now do you live in a major city   Dallas Dallas area i live in Plano   in Dallas okay   which is just a a suburb of of Dallas do you live in a major city   right uh i live in Raleigh North Carolina   oh okay   and probably not quite as big as Dallas but uh   no well myself i i go to Richardson which is a i teach school and so i dont  commute that far its only about four miles but the majority of people that live in this area go into Dallas to work and and when you if you go out on the freeway and you look you see almost every car is just one passenger   yeah   and our public transportation systems a joke so people just dont bother to take that because its inconvenient we dont have any kind of a a train or uh you know anything like some of the big cities do   oh umhum right   were supposed to get one but its you know way off in the future   way off yeah   but no its just it   well ive found the easiest way is to is to ride bikes in Raleigh anyway and   oh is that right   i used to live in Colorado and it was even more of a bigger deal there but um   sure   i ride my bike everywhere in town well there i probably wouldnt ride it to the the opposite side of town but i can ride it to downtown with no problem at all   how large is Raleigh   its about two hundred and fifty thousand   so its pretty big yeah   uh the diameter of the city is probably its got a belt line around it which is a a diameter of about ten twelve miles   uhhuh and so you ride your bike to work and everything or arent you oh well thats great   right which is about three and a half four miles   see thats that isnt even i mean im not sure that a person even a percentage of of of people in the Dallas area ride bikes to work you know i just dont think they do i never see anybody   yeah umhum   um another thing that that i think our my familys real conscious of is is is to stop using aerosol cans and you know uh you know get another find another way instead of   right yeah that one so easy i dont know why people wont   you know the pump i know it really is and we just need not to buy the stuff and those businesses will have to change you know the corporations and so forth have to change if you dont buy it theyre not going to make it so   yeah yeah   yeah that is an easy one      yeah   but uh you know and i notice probably a lot of uh commercial pollution and        and factory pollution in Dallas you can see it some days its really bad   yeah you can see it in Raleigh  its ugly   yeah its yeah its awful its nothing like California where the smog is constant but its still there and you know it   yeah   if we i think if we really realized how much we do breathe in thats unhealthy we would immediately do something about it but i dont think people realize how unhealthy the the air is   yeah yeah thats what you said youre a school teacher   yes   um how much how how much education of air pollution and all that do you   well i think i dont see i only teach English and and uh but the science teacher i teach fifth grade and were departmentalized and   okay   the science teacher does a really big unit on it and i think the kids are more informed than adults are i mean and   right yeah i would i would agree with that because ive done actually ive done some volunteer teaching on on uh ecology and all that at at a middle school   uhhuh uhhuh   and um the the kids knew well the teacher the science teachers were pretty sharp too but the kids in general know more than adults do about it   uhhuh they do they do and they and and i think that they are they care a little bit more and i think as adults we need to care because its the the future for our kids and i   yeah   you know i mean my kids are much more aware than i was at their age about things like that and i think its its definitely has to be that   right well it probably at your age it wasnt a problem   no it really wasnt it wasnt a problem it i mean it probably im sure it was beginning to be a problem but people were just werent   yeah   uh aware of it like they are today and i think thats where it has to start with the kids because its going to be their world soon and i think it and and were real big on you know Plano which is a small suburb of Dallas about a hundred thousand   yeah umhum okay   um i think were more than that about a hundred thirty thousand now but um theyre really trying their best to start recycling and things like that that will   right   and we just we have separate garbage collections now for plastics and cans and newspaper and which i think is i mean thats that should be just a way of life for everybody you shouldnt even complain about it you should just do it   right right i think they ought to well the way it used to be was that you had you had to take your recycles to a special place it should be the other way around where  you have to take your non recyclables to a special place and then people would   uhhuh thats true   would have an incentive   youre right youre right   yeah Raleigh has has curbside recycling which is really nice   well you know it just has to be when you consider the landfills we were not going to have any soon and its   yeah   its ridiculous but the thing the quandary that im in is that that we had a great big article in in in the newspaper last week about ive been real big about going to to the store and asking for paper instead of plastic well   right   that is really controversial because some scientists you know f eel like plastic i mean paper is worse than plastic its just its just a real um debate about which one is is the best really the best thing to do is to bring um you know a cloth bag yeah   yeah yeah your own bag i do that sometimes but i i forget a lot   do you yeah i see thats what i do too i forget and and besides when i go to the store i have a family you know i i get maybe ten twelve bags of groceries and that would be a little  a little expensive although you know im sure some   yeah i think i i dont know i think the papers still got to be better because well the the major problem with paper usually is when they bleach it the dioxins they just usually end up getting dumped into the water supply   umhum   but um the grocery bags with them being colored or being raw paper i dont see that much of a problem as opposed to a petroleum product i mean tree trees can grow back if if theyre handled in the correct way but the petroleum products like plastic i mean theyre going to run out of oil whatever theyre going to do   yeah umhum   it doesnt grow   yes thats right thats right youre right   i mean thats thats where the main thats where i see that papers got to be better   uhhuh well you know and they say that you know plastic is recyclable but not many people use them again you know   no its and plastic like that is not a hundred percent recyclable it they lose a lot and it takes a lot of energy to do it   yeah thats true sure sure i think that you know i think that its tremendous the research theyre doing on all of this because i think we need to to know and be more aware of it so we can do some changing but   yeah   the majority of people are so lazy about it that theyre not willing to to sacrifice a little to to make the world a better place and its kind of sad because especially if you have children and because you know you want   yeah   your kids and their kids to to be able to   have a nice place to live yeah   be a part of a yeah a world thats halfway decent and you know just in my lifetime ive seen such a change in the environment and its scary because by the time my kids have kids and theyre growing up its going to be a completely different world you know and its its scary so   yeah   you know like i i know that i need to carpool and i dont and uh and i you rationalize and say well i only am four miles away and that its no big deal and   umhum yeah   well you know but   i guess the the first step is to find a happy medium i mean you could easily say well we should go back to living in caves but no ones going to do that so i think you need to make compromises slowly enough people adjust to it       and uh   right right   not too slowly but   well you know just yeah just with with our thing in Plano it had when recycling garbage it hasnt it hasnt been that long and it was just uh really an easy adjustment for most people but there was a few small percentage that griped and complained and wrote   yeah   you know letters to the editor and you know like it was some real great big deal inconvenience and   um   but it seems to me you should just be able to give up a little bit to make the world better but some people dont think that so   yeah   and some people dont and some people i think really believe and maybe theyre rationalizing but they really believe that everybodys making a bigger deal out of the problem than it is   no way yeah   and that and that its right no way its its there and weve got to face it   i think theyre not making a big enough deal about it   thats right i think in some cases they arent   yeah   and i see i wonder how i wonder how much the laws that Congress passed several years ago are really enforced as far as big companies and   yeah well i think theres a lot of violations that slip under the table   oh i think so too and i think that theyre not fined the way they should be or theyre they pay them off or whatever so they can get away with it   yeah   i i was born in Ohio and when um when i was young we did we did a lot of fishing and on Lake Erie and i  i mean when i went back   umhum right   i just couldnt believe the difference its just terrible the way its polluted because of of big corporations that dump and you know and you just feel so bad because at one time it was a wonderful beautiful lake and now its a mess   right hum ive ive never known it to be one so i guess im a little bit younger than you   yeah i when i was little my dad had a boat and we would go fishing on Lake Erie and it was beautiful   umhum   and  its not beautiful anymore so and thats   um
