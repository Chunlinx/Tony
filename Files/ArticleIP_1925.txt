                                 The Power of Biobabble            Theinvitation came rather disappointingly by conventional mail Still itsounded enticing The Cato Institute and the Bionomics Institute invite you toNow What Living With Perpetual Evolution  the fifth annual BionomicsConference Leading the list of speakers for the Nov  conference wasGregory Benford one of my favorite sciencefiction writers And at the top ofthe card was a stirring quotation from Bionomics Institute founder MichaelRothschild            Like a deepsea volcanobursting to the surface spewing out vast new lands soon to be inhabited by acomplex ecosystem the Web is creating a virtual landscape that will soon beoccupied by an awesome array of economic organisms  Its evolution at warpspeed Strap yourself in            The CatoInstitute is a libertarian think tank noted mostly for its adamant oppositionto government regulation But what on earth or in cyberspace isbionomicsand why is Cato and Forbes                ASAP  which is acosponsor of the conference promoting it            Although you have to look at Rothschilds  bookBionomics Economy as Ecosystem  to get the full flavor the essentialtenets of the movement are spelled out on the Bionomics Institute home pagewhich offers a primer called Bionomics  The primer explains            All traditional schoolsof economics are based on the concepts of classical physics while bionomics isbased on the principles of evolutionary biology  Orthodox economicsdescribes the economy as a machine  Instead bionomics says that aneconomy is like an evolving ecosystem A modern market economy is like atropical rainforest            Soundsgood doesnt it Bionomics has won converts not only at the Cato Institute butalso among a wide variety of influential people ranging from Newt Gingrich toClyde Prestowitz  Fortune has described it as a policymakers versionof The Celestine Prophecy  And Rothschild is certainly a brightenergetic fellow There are however two big weaknesses in his thinking Hedoesnt know much about economics and he doesnt know much about evolutionWhen I say that Rothschild doesnt know much about economics I dont mean thatconventional economics is right and his ideas are wrongalthough where theydiffer that is generally true I mean that his description of what conventionaleconomics is all about bears no relation to what actual economists believe orsay            Take for starters his assertion thatorthodox economics describes the economy as a machine  You might presumefrom his use of quotation marks that this is something an actual economistsaid or at least that it was the sort of thing that economists routinely sayBut no economist I know thinks of the economy as being anything like amachineor believes as Rothschild asserts a bit later that because theeconomy is like a machine it is possible to make precise predictions Infact it was economists who came up with the famed random walk hypothesisabout stock prices which says that they are inherentlyunpredictable            It getsbetter Rothschild tells us I know this is hard for noneconomists tobelieve but orthodox economics essentially ignores technological change Thatis even harder for economists to believe In fact I dont know how Im goingto break the news to the guy in the next office You see poor Bob Solow isunder the impression that he got the Nobel Prize for his work on technologicalchange in particular for his demonstration that technology not capitalaccumulation historically has been the main driving force in economic growthOn a different subject its going to be a shock to environmentaleconomistswho have spent decades arguing that one good way to controlpollution is to create a market in emission permitsto learn that this is anidea unique to bionomics and totally at odds with orthodox economic thinkingAnd Im not feeling too good myself Rothschild insists that conventionaleconomics depends on the assumption of diminishing returns and that as aresult economists have completely ignored the possibility of increasingreturns Does this mean I have to give back that medal the American EconomicAssociation gave me for my work on increasing returns and internationaltrade            Well all this is more or less the usual Whenever amanifesto about economics contains a sentence that begins Orthodox economicsassumes that  it almost always completes that sentence with somethingstrange and unfamiliar In just the last two years Ive learned that I believethat gross domestic product is the sole measure of economic welfare thatgrowth at more than  percent always causes inflation and that suddenspeculative attacks on currencies cant happen Ive also learned that theNobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences keeps going to supplysidersorshould that be Marxists            What issurprising however is that a man who proposes to replace what he imagines tobe the mechanistic worldview of conventional economics with a new view based onevolutionary biology should know so little about the discipline that supposedlyinspires him            Rothschilds lack of familiarity withevolutionary theory may not be obvious to uninformed readershis book bristleswith ostentatious footnotes and seemingly learned references It happenshowever that I am an evolution groupie I started as a fan of greatpopularizers like Richard Dawkins and Steven Pinker and I have since graduatednot only to hero worship of the leading evolutionary theorists but also toreading textbooks and even journal articles And so when I picked up a copy ofBionomics  the first thing I did was check out the authors treatment ofmy heroes and of what I knew to have been the important  His record wasperfect Not one of the right people was mentioned not one of the keydevelopments discussed The bionomics version of what evolutionary theory isabout has as little to do with the real thing as its version of what economicsis about does            What thebionomics guys apparently think evolution is about is constantbreathless changestrap yourself inchange so rapid that everything isunpredictable that the rules themselves are constantly changing Rothschildseems in particular to view evolutionary thinking as the antithesis ofequilibrium economics Apparently nobody told him that equilibriumthinkingthe idea that in order to understand how individuals interact it isoften useful to ask what would happen if each individual was doing the best heor she could given what everyone else is doingis almost as prevalent in  Infact the really funny thing is that for the most part the bionomics programhas already been implemented Economics already is very similar toevolutionary theory and vice versa However neither field looks anything likebionomics            OK enough already The really interesting question is whythe Cato Institute and other freemarket conservatives should be willing tosquander their intellectual credibility by associating their names with thissort of thing After all conventional economics already has lots of nicethings to say about free markets Why not stick with Adam Smith            Part ofthe answer I suspect is sociological Traditional conservative causes likethe gold standard tend to have a musty oldfashioned feel They sound like thesort of thing that appeals mainly to rich old men and conservative think tanksare of course mainly funded by rich old men Young vigorous conservativesare therefore always looking for ways to seem more fashionforward Some ofthem parade their knowledge of pop culture some make a point of beingphotographed wearing miniskirts and some go for what we might call theWired style of economic rhetoricthe continual assertion that thingsare changing so fast that we have to use lots of exclamation points            But there is also a more serious reason thatbionomics appeals to the freemarket faithful They find the conventional casefor laissezfaire too modest too conditional for their tastes Standardeconomic theory offers reasons to believe that markets are a good way toorganize economic activity But it does not deify the market system and iteven offers a number of fairly welldefined ways in which markets can fail orat least could be helped with government intervention And that for someconservatives is just not good enough            Bionomics doesnt actuallyprovide any coherent argument in favor of free markets In fact Rothschildsoriginal book seems to hedge its bets It spends a full chapter JapansSecret Weapon explaining how governmentbusiness cooperation makes theJapanese economy invincible remember the book was published in  Butwhat the doctrine lacks in serious argument it makes up for in rhetoric Theeconomy is an ecosystem like a tropical rain forest And what could be worsethan trying to control a tropical rain forest from the top down You wouldnttry to control an ecosystem wiping out species you didnt like andpromoting ones you did would you            Wellactually you probably would I think its called agriculture            What do we learn from the willingness of extremefreemarket conservatives to associate themselves with crank doctrines likebionomics I think the main lesson is that their faith in free markets is justthat a faith which does not rest on either logic or evidence Belief comesfirst then they look for arguments to justify that belief And they aretherefore not too scrupulous about the quality of those arguments or of thosewho produce them            Anyway I guess I wontattend the conference I would have liked to meet Benford but I couldnt standto watch the author of Great                Sky                River demeaning himselfby consorting with such disreputable company
