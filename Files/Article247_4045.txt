                                 Why Reform Britains House of Lords            Chatterbox a citizen of the United States who has a somewhat limitedunderstanding of how they do things in the United Kingdom is baffled by thecommentary coming out of Britain concerning the future of the House of Lords As was widely publicized theLabor government earlier this month evicted  very Monty Pythonishhereditary peers Binkies from the upper chamber temporarily leaving  andotherwise putting the House of Lords in the hands of about  politicallyappointed life peers day boys whose title and membership dies with them Alively discussion has now begun about how to complete the reform of the Houseof Lords which for most of this century has had the power only to delaylegislation The scenarios under consideration tend to emphasize makingmembership entirely or partially elective which would make the House of Lordsmore democratic and then giving the upper chamber greater power than itcurrently enjoys If nothing is done the House of Lords will persist as apatronage tool for whichever party happens to control the House of Commons            What Chatterbox doesnt understand is why Britons dont kill the House ofLords outright From this side of the Atlantic the UK has long appeared tobe ruled by an essentially unicameral parliament Making it unequivocallyunicameral would seem to be a small and eminently sensible stepone that Laborembraced throughout the s and s Click here to read the House of Lords own compendium of major th century proposals to reform or abolish the chamber Insteadthe talk is drifting in the direction of turning the House of Lords into ananglified US Senate Wouldnt this give the UK a government far lessstreamlined than what it enjoys today Chatterbox

to buy the book which makes an excellent case forabolishing the US Senate            Seeking guidance Chatterbox queried Christopher Hitchens the VanityFair and Nation columnist who is British by birth and an admirablyuncompromising smallr republican In an email Hitchens likened the ejectionof the Binkies to building a bridge from the middle of the river                           First ought to come the point of principle do you want a hereditary headof state or inherited seats in legislatures Then and only then does one have aconstitutional discussion about which alternative to adopt Brilliant as theyare at avoiding anything that smacks of principle the Blairites now have asecond chamber with almost a hundred chosen hereditary peers and theremainder a bunch of party appointees Nobody could conceivably have designedsuch an outcome if they were writing a Constitution And so of course thispreempts as it may be meant to the persistent argument over whether Britainought to have a written document with an appended Bill of Rights It alsoavoids the ticklish subject of the Windsors who are now the only family in thecountry with political power by right of birth                        Concerning unicameralism though Hitchens seemed unenthusiastic He said itwas fine by me but most big decisions in modern history have been takenwithout reference to Parliament and so I suppose that one chamber is as easy tobypass as two            Chatterbox next queried Hendrik Hertzberg of The New Yorker  who notlong ago wrote a compelling Talk of the Town piece endorsing Gov JesseVenturas plan to turn Minnesotas legislature unicameral At present theonly unicameral state legislature in the US is Nebraskas Chatterboxwill give Hertzberg the last word                           There was a lot of sentiment for abolition back in Lloyd Georges daythe last time Lords reform really had traction Lloyd George himself wanted toget rid of the thing but he had to settle for the Parliament Act of which scaled the Lords power down from being able to kill legislation outrightto being able to delay it for two years reduced to one year in I think  actually                           Several things have happened since then For one the relativelytoothless post House of Lords lulled people into thinking it was a goodidea to have a delaying or amending chamber as a safeguard against overhastylegislation For another a certain amount of bicameral delusion has seepedover from America The trend in British constitutionalism at the moment is awayfrom absolute parliamentary ie House of Commons sovereignty and towarddivided sovereignty of various kindsparliaments for Scotland and Walesstronger local governments with elected mayors the European parliamentAbolishing the second unionwide chamber outright would go against what a lotof people assume to be the spirit of the times                        Personally Id like to see them abolish the Lords and I bet Tony Blairwould too The idea of an elected second chamber sounds all niceynice anddemocratic but the more democratic legitimacy a second chamber has thestronger the possibility of gridlock An appointed second chamber would haveless legitimacy therefore less power therefore less likelihood of gumming upthe works
