        im an avid recycler um but our citys not doing as much as they ought to what about you all there     there is a group in town called Nacogdoches Recycles that will meet i believe its once a month at the park and you can take plastics papers   uhhuh   or bottles   uhhuh   but its up to you to collect them its up to you to get them down there and then what they do with them i dont know   you dont know yeah   there isnt any you somebody had had talked once before to City Council meeting about maybe having different colored waste cans   right that they pick up   uhhuh because they do that in Palestine and nobody wanted to go for that they were gonna charge a little extra on the bill and nobody wanted to do that   umhum umhum uhhuh right nobody wanted to do it   and i save aluminum cans and to take those to the to the closest place is about   it do you have a place to take them   its about thirty minutes away   wow is that right   yeah and it and the last time we took some things the price is not really worth it   worth it yeah not worth the gas huh yeah   yeah yeah because by the time and you save them and squish them and   right   theyre just they were everywhere   yeah oh i know i know it   and thats the bad thing about it and newspapers we we started saving newspapers and stuff well they just packed up and i have cats well they had a field day       destroyed those   now what do they do i have cats too but they dont do anything with newspaper   mine have some kind of paper thing oh yes any any kind of cardboard and paper and they just tear it up   oh really do with their claws or chew it   umhum both   how fascinating   i dont know what it is   oh isnt that interesting ive got three cats but newspapers dont seem to interest them at all   i dont know what it is and you cant leave the mail dont i dont leave the mail on on the coffee table or its chewed up   oh no is that right oh my gosh   and it was just really one ive got ive got several and one in particular but then she kind of showed the other ones what was going on   and then they learned how huh   uhhuh so now its just a big play play time   well thats funny well i i we we do have more facilities than that around here so that we theyre they are trying in Dallas to do some uh curbside recycling theyve got special special you they selected sites and in those sites they theyve been doing it and theyve had a pretty good success so theyre talking about you know doing it more but it isnt in my area so ive got a kitchen full of you know cans and bottles and scrap metal and everything and and then i have to drive it somewhere and there   yeah i think if they would make it a little more convenient for us everybody would   then everybody would do it well its one of those things that makes you feel good you know makes you feel like youre part of of a of a solution to a problem   thats true   and and uh theres not that much that makes you feel like youve got any control over anything so   oh i know and we take the little plastic bags back to the to the grocery store   back to the grocery so your grocery store does that uhhuh yeah well thats good   uhhuh but but as far as bottles and things go there isnt any place any any close   and thats strange because now bottles are the one thing that are totally recyclable theyre the easiest and and uh you know i mean i try to keep and reuse and i   yeah yeah   oh i even carry around uh you know like if i i i travel around the city a lot so that im frequently stopping at fast food place and eating  in the car or on the way to the next site   umhum   and ive gotten to saving the plastic forks and washing them and using them again so i dont keep doing that but boy i mean its an exhausting way to live   it really is   we are very use to throwing things out theres no question about it and   yeah i ive started saving like you said the plastic knives and forks and things   uhhuh   and i save all the little condiments and things and i   yeah right exactly exactly lots of little uh soya sauces and ketchups all over the place   yeah things that i normally threw out because they just give you ton and now ive got a big basket full in the refrigerator   yeah thats right thats right well now ive gotten to where i say dont put any of that in  because it just leaves me with having to dispose of it   exactly theyll say do you want any no i do not   no please no   but i i try and we have a lot of of newspapers and magazines and things like that but   yeah   thats   and thats hard to get rid of unless youve got theres one place here in town that will take the slicks and all your junk mail and cereal boxes and everything but you have to drive it downtown and so you know my kitchen i mean certainly i dont like anyone to ever come in because ive just got this stuff everywhere i dont drive it every day so ive got just piles of it   yeah and ive got a tiny little kitchen so the option of you know some people will maybe have four bins one for your garbage and then i have no room   right but but you have to move out of your house to have all that yeah   yeah i have i have room enough for one garbage can and that it is   yeah yeah i know and it and it really is hard and and uh i then ill fill up the back of my car  and im driving around with trash in my car and that well at least maybe it keeps someone from stealing   yeah   you know because  theyll think theres nothing in this car but trash anyway   and thats true
