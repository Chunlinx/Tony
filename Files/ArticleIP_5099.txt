                                 No Medicare Scare            Whod have thought seniorswould be clamoring to Congress Please dont take my HMO away Only a yearago politicians were being castigated for herding the elderly into HMOs Butnow as health maintenance organizations are suddenly pulling out of dozens ofMedicare markets  elderly customers are scrambling to find insurancecoverage beyond the end of the year and demanding that Congress do somethingabout it News reports raise the specter of an HMO stampede to the door thatcould unravel the entire  million member Medicare HMO system            TheHMOs say its all because the government pays too little The government hasfired back saying that if anything HMOs are paid too much The Health CareFinancing Administration has refused to renegotiate rates or to allow the HMOsto drop benefits on established contracts And politicians including thepresident are pounding the HMOs for breaking their promises of coverage forthe elderly Sen Chris Dodd DConn has announced that he will introducelegislation that will block the HMOs from dropping out for six months            Health policy debates tend to be eyeglazingbut there are two reasons why casual observers should care about whats goingon here            First the Medicare HMOprogram is a critical test case for Clintonian Third Way thinking Underpolicy changes passed last year Medicare has been transformed into an enormousvoucher system It is the prototype of a still new and controversial ideaGovernment should finance a generous safety net but competing privateorganizations should do the work The government now allocates to each seniorin Medicare a fixed amount of money that will buy coverage from either aprivate HMO or the traditional governmentrun Medicare programthus fosteringcompetition If HMOs refuse to participate however the whole reform plan isdead            SecondMedicare savings are supposed to provide the major part of the muchheraldeddeficit reduction projected for the next few years billion out of a total billion from  through  And  billion of that is to come fromsavings expected in the Medicare HMO program If the HMO program fails it willbe an economic as well as a social disaster            All signs however suggest that the immediate problems inthe program have been exaggerated                           More HMOs are seeking toenter Medicare markets than are seeking to withdraw The pullouts affectjust  of  million Medicare HMO customers Industry observers and HMOofficials say that only a few more HMOs are expected to leave the program                           Withdrawals are notproof that HMO payments are too low as the HMOs claim In fact if nextyears payment rates were high enough to keep all the  contracting HMOsprofitable then Medicare would clearly be paying too much As Harvardeconomist Joseph Newhouse points out the optimal rate of exit is unlikely tobe zero Presumably at least some of the plans are inefficient We dont knowprecisely what an optimal rate would be but the anticipated withdrawal rateamong HMOs plans covering about  percent of enrollees is probably notunreasonable                           HMO payments have infact been too high The HMO pullouts seemed so unexpected because untilrecently HMOs were pushing to expand their Medicare business The reasonwas simple The government was overpaying them Before this year under aformula that even the HMO industry admits was rather robust HMO paymentswere derived from the traditional Medicare program which had a much sickerpopulation and costs that rose  percent a year The overpayment was estimatedto be  percent so last year Congress put in a new formula that essentiallycut the increase for  to  percent Given the tightened payments and amajor downturn in HMO stocks some marginal marketsespecially ruralareasstarted to look unprofitable HMOs were allowed to drop them up to thismonth So with the deadline looming a bunch did                           Nearly  percent of dropped enrollees are in areas where they can chooseanother HMO  according to the Department of Health and Human Services Sothe effects of the announced withdrawals will be limited            To be sure people who have to switch HMOs mayhave to change doctors And those who lose all HMO coverage may suffersubstantial financial loss Standard Medicare coverage pays only  percent ofdoctor and hospital bills and nothing for drugs The HMOs pay all medical billsexcept for a small copayment and generally provide generous drug coverageoften at no extra costexcept giving up ones choice of doctor or hospitalAccording to the American Association of Retired Persons a senior enrolling inan HMO saves  per yearabout  percent of average incomecompared withthose with the standard coverage and some supplemental insurance No wonderHMOs sign up  new Medicare customers every month            WhatMedicare is now suffering is not a calamity It is the inevitable turbulenceand messiness of introducing choice and competition to a major social programIn a voucher system seniors have a choice of plans but the plans havechoices too They arent breaking any promises if they decide to take theirball and go home The benefits however may still be worth this downsideAfter all regulations failed to control Medicares costs adequately The hopeand the logic is that competing HMOs might have better success            It would be a big mistake for Congress torespond to irate seniors by punishing the HMOs Dodds proposal to block thepullouts is crazy Forcing HMOs to stay in a failing business cannot be goodfor seniors and would chill entry by others Nor should Congress heed HMOlobbyists and force Medicare officials to renegotiate the  contracts TheHMOs knew the rules and the number of dropouts does not seem excessive            The real cause for concernis that HMOs may fail to control costs in the long term Over half of managedcare plans are now losing money and a major shakeout is underway Afterseveral years of remarkable success insurers are having serious troublecontrolling the costs generated by doctors like me and not just for the seniorpopulation New drugs diagnostics and other technologies have acceleratedcosts far beyond the pace of inflation Insurers are seeking doubledigitincreases in premiums from employers who will then cut health benefits wagesor both The government will face intense pressure to raise Medicare HMOpayments in future years Suddenly the current budget surplus looksshortlived indeed            If HMOs like regulators inthe s fail to tame health costs we will be left with an ugly choice Dowe let the new technologieswith their promise of a longer and betterlifeconsume ever more of the nations wealth and productivity Or do weration them More than anything the current HMO troubles are evidence thatthis could be the major domestic policy debate of the coming decade
