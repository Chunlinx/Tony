Delhis Asian Age which carried acartoon showing a sicklooking fellow identified as the Indian coalitiongovernment being addressed by a doctor holding a phallic rocketlike objectlabeled nuclear test The caption This will definitely cure your ailmentIts made with Viagra On this two days after Indias first three undergroundnuclear tests the Asian                Age joined the rest of the Indian pressin praising the government for carrying out the tests and urging the rest ofthe world to welcome India not isolate it It said no one had ever doubtedthat India and Pakistan were both de facto nuclear powers and that thesimplest answer would be for both to emerge from a rather inadequate closet andthen sign the nuclear proliferation treaty            In aneditorialthe following day after India had carried out two further nuclear tests thepaper was rather less upbeat It urged the government to cut down drasticallyon spending and to devise an economic policy attractive enough for foreigninvestors to continue patronising India It pointed out that Japan not theUnited States is Indias largest trade partner that Japan had categoricallycounselled New Delhi about six weeks ago not to proceed with the tests andwould now take measures which correspond with its outrage It is here thatIndian diplomacy faces its severest test because unless there is a concreteaction plan to tackle the political and economic fallout of the tests thecountry will be faced with a real crisis            The Times of India said Thursday that US Japanese and Germansanctions against India were hardly going to cause sleeplessness in NewDelhi but it also urged the Indian government to adopt a more welcomingstance towards foreign capital than it has so far The newspaper attacked thehypocrisy which governs US policy on nuclear matters and said no country hasthe right to dictate to another what policies it can and cannot followTherefore the US move needs to be condemned in the strongest possibleterms            AnotherIndian paper the DeccanChronicle said it is in Indias interest that Pakistan also join thenuclear club If the theory is correct that a credible nuclear deterrent makeswar unnecessary if not impossible then another war between India and Pakistanwill automatically be unnecessary if both acquire nuclear weapon capabilityThe same paper quoted a minor Indian government ministerBandaru Dattatreyaunion minister of state for urban developmentas stating at a press conferenceafter the tests that a war would bring unity to India We need not have to beafraid of wars he said If there is a war we have to fight Asked by asurprised reporter if he really meant what he said the minister replied YesI mean it  I am on record            The Pakistani newspaper Dawn counseled prudence andsaid it wasreassuring that Indias nuclear tests had failed to push Pakistan into somesort of kneejerk reaction But it added Pakistan must undertake awideranging review of its foreign policy economic planning and defence andsecurity strategy if it is to be adequately prepared to meet the criticalsituation which Indias brazen nuclear ambitions have created in South AsiaIn an oped piece Dawn commentator Sultan Ahmed said that Indiasaims mirror US strategy during the arms race with the former Soviet Uniontobring about the economic collapse of the enemy Pakistans spending on defenseis  percent of the gross national product while Indias is only  percenthe said but Indias armed forces were double the size of PakistansUltimately a strong defence needs a strong economy Ahmed added Japansmilitary spending is one per cent of the GNP but that is equal to  billiondollars or ten times what Pakistan spends on defence            In Japan the daily Mainichi Shimbuncondemned India in an editorial Thursday for foolish actions which go against theuniversal desire to wipe such weapons of mass destruction from the face of theEarth But it also attacked the United States for excluding certain teststhat do not involve the detonation of nuclear devices from the provisions ofthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty It went on to point out that the US Senatehas yet to ratify the treaty            The United States is theworlds largest nuclear power and its failure to take nuclear disarmamentseriously provides encouragement to countries like India We must insist thatthe nuclear powers meet their disarmament responsibilities in order to preventother Indias from emerging in the future            In Australia the Age of Melbourne said the testsmade everyone on this planet feel less safe and that Indias flaunting ofits nuclear credentials comes down to nothing more reputable than a desire fornational prestige            In Hong Kong the South China Morning Post under theheadline US Policy Blown Wide Open ran an opinion piece by Simon Becksaying the tests have driven a truck through what Washington believed to beits wellconceived South Asia policy It said that cancellation of PresidentClintons planned visit to India this fall would be disastrous and onlyintensify nationalist fervor in that country Instead of feigning horror overthis weeks developments the time is ripe for Mr Clinton to accept therealities of another major member of the nuclear club and use his visit tomake sure its government knows that its future lies in forging closer ties tothe democratic West Beck concluded            In Britain where thegovernment has refused to impose sanctions on India the Times said that PresidentClinton needed British support and should have it
