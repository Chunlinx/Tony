Discussion ofDraft RecommendationsDaniel Hungerford opened the final session of the conference byoutlining the groups ultimate taskto create researchrecommendations from conference deliberations Before theconference he and Daniel Pollock drafted recommendations for thesteering committee to consider During the conference the steeringcommittee modified those recommendations and they were distributedto attendees for general discussionHungerford stated that the goal of the conference was not toachieve unanimity regarding the recommendations but to havesignificant and general agreement He indicated the process wouldbe to discuss the recommendations one by one identifying any gapsor omissions and offering general comments He emphasized that thesequence of the recommendations did not imply a priority orderBecause the published recommendations will include supporting texthe encouraged the group to consider any points of clarificationthat would be instructive Hungerford then opened the floor fordiscussionRecommendation  Research on screening and intervention shouldaddress the full spectrum of alcohol problems among EDpatientsRichard Brown remarked that in many circles intervention doesnot necessarily include referral so he suggested that the firstrecommendation include referral Also he said the phrasealcohol problems does not always include risky drinking andproblem drinking so he suggested adding risky and problemdrinking to the recommendationDaniel Hungerford noted that the supporting text could providedetail on the spectrum of alcohol problems He suggested the mainpoint of the first recommendation was that research efforts shouldinclude the whole continuum of alcohol problems not just a portionof the continuum such as alcoholdependent drinkersJean Shope advocated that the definition of the full spectrumof alcohol problems include primary prevention She recommendedthis understanding be made explicit in the final documentGordon Smith suggested that the recommendations should addressthe problems of polysubstance abuseCarl Soderstrom wondered whether alcohol problems referred tothe spectrum of drinking problems or the medical problemsassociated with drinkingHerman Diesenhaus pointed out that hazardous drinking causes acomplex set of problems that include personal social and legalproblems in addition to medical problems The phrase alcoholproblems includes all those problems as well as the hazardousdrinking He noted that different pieces of the solution will liein the medical realm and in the social welfare realm He expressedconcern about how to reflect this complexity in therecommendationsGuohua Li suggested changing the phrase among ED patients toin the emergency setting because alcohol problems are not limitedto patients Perhaps the recommendations should address alcoholproblems among providers and physiciansStephen Hargarten thought that the term alcoholrelatedproblems would appeal to clinicians more than alcohol problemsbecause they see those problems in their practices He said thatincluding related in terms gives the sense of broadeningthemRichard Ries said he did not believe that screening for alcoholneuropathy was intended to be part of the recommendation Hesuggested that the recommendation be clear that it is addressingalcohol use disorders or problems not for medical careconsequencesHungerford replied that screening for specific medical careconsequences was not part of the recommendation but thatconsequence items may be used in the screening He added that broadscreening would identify people with medical conditions as well Hefound thatscreening with a low cut point on the AUDIT identified morepeople with severe alcohol problems and alcohol dependence than didnot using a uniform screening method He agreed that this issueneeds clarification in this recommendationRichard Longabaugh said that the term alcohol problems impliesthat the patients problem is consumption He favoredalcoholrelated problems because consumption is not the problemThe problem is the consequences resulting from excessivedrinkingElinor Walker endorsed the notion of using the emergency caresetting rather than the ED particularly to include focus on theprehospital care settingHungerford added that the trauma care setting should be includedas wellLi added his support to alcoholrelated problems butsuggested another alternative problem drinking which iscommonly usedEdward Bernstein pointed out that the recommendations wouldlikely stand alone for readings and come without context With thatin mind he suggested listing the full spectrum of alcoholproblems from risky drinking to alcohol abuse to alcoholdependency He felt that it would be a mistake to open this set ofresearch recommendations with a recommendation that includedscreening for withdrawal or other conditions Another possibilitywould be to say the full spectrum of alcohol misuseRecommendation  Screening instruments under consideration foruse in EDs should be evaluated as a component of protocols thatprovide interventions for patientsRobert Woolard supported the recommendation and noted that mostresearch on screening has involved an evaluation of screening butnot an intervention Trying to apply those findings to aclinicalsetting where there is the question of training and the linkbetween the screening instruments and the intervention becomesproblematic Enough research has been conducted on instrumentsalone he said and new research should link screens withinterventionsLinda Degutis recommended amending the recommendation to readscreening interventions and methods under consideration Thenin the supporting text she suggested addressing the differentpeople who might be doing the screening and the need to tie it tointerventionLongabaugh wondered whether the intended consumers of thedocument would include government officials researcherspractitioners and academiciansHungerford answered that the summary of the conference would bepublished in an emergency medicine journal and that readers wouldinclude these groupsDaniel Pollock added that the message of the recommendationscould also be conveyed at professional meetings The goal was toinfluence people who are in a position to make changes in thefieldBrown believed the recommendation was worded too strongly Tohim it was saying that work should not include screening researchin isolation He noted that little is known about effectivescreening for certain subpopulations so screening research stillhas its place Although he agreed that a total research portfolioshould have a strong emphasis on intervention and not justscreeningDiesenhaus described his use of a slogan and abbreviation for atreatment strategy Screening Brief Intervention andReferralSBIR Research on the individual components is importantbut the strategy for the emergency room setting is as followsscreen decide if a brief intervention is called for and if notgive a referral Emergency setting personnel need to understand allthree components and how they are linked He was not sure ifreferral could be included every time but acknowledged that itis a vital part of the workHungerford emphasized that research on screening is neededHowever he believed research on screening instruments that is notlinked with an intervention leads to the easy assumption thatresults will be generalizable to using that screening instrument ina full protocol The second recommendation therefore is intendedto point out that results from the screening literature are notnecessarily generalizable to realworld settings in which screeningwould be paired with interventionsRies suggested that defining SBIR upfront might helpclinicians understand the recommendations better If we do not aclinician who is interested in seizures or pancreatitis couldeasily misread the wording of this recommendation To avoid thatfor this recommendation we would have to say something likeProblematic alcoholuse screening instruments under considerationfor use in the ED should be evaluated as a component of protocolsthat provide alcoholuse interventions for patients to decreaseproblems or useHungerford said he understood If we do not predefine SBIRwe have to define what we are talking about with eachrecommendation If we do define SBIR upfront we make the readingmore understandable and more efficientGail DOnofrio noted that in this context we use referral tomean sending a patient to a specialized treatment facilityHowever in emergency medicine everyone gets a referralto primarycare a clinic followup or another health or social service Thereferral in SBIR could include both meaningsHargartens initial understanding of this recommendation wasthat screening activities for alcohol problems should be integratedwith the screening and interventions the ED does for a whole rangeof problems He suggested that the recommendation be worded in sucha manner that this effort does not seem to be a parallelactivityHungerford proposed that just as screening research should becarried out in the context of protocols that include interventionsthose protocols should be integrated with the whole system of EDoperationsChristopher Dunn thought the word evaluate made thisrecommendation vague What would be evaluatedthe usefulness of ascreen or the psychometric properties of a screen He believed thatthe screen can have an interventive effect so he wanted researchon whether patients fare as well with a screen as they do withbrief advice or more sophisticated techniquesDavid Fiellin advocated eliminating the second recommendationTo him the statement implied that screening instruments should beevaluated only as a component of protocols that provideinterventions He believed that the statement was dangerous becausethere are research methodologies that are related to evaluatingscreening and separate ones related to evaluating interventionsand we may not want to obligate tying the two togetherThomas Babor supported technical research on screening and thewording of this recommendation However he raised a largerissuethe moral imperative of screening He said that screeningsets up the expectation that something has to follow Withoutscreening there cannot be much intervention He noted that therecommendation could be seen as a way of driving widespreadapplications of interventions If that is the goal he thought weshould be examining how to accomplish screening There are largeobstacles to screening and practical research on screeningimplementation incentives efficiency and its ability to reachlarge numbers of people at low cost is necessary He believed in apublic health approach to screening which means we would not do itif the yield is low He suggested that the technical aspects ofscreening were not as fruitful topics for research as how to screenthe greatest number of patients at the lowest costBernstein suggested that the recommendation not be eliminatedbut rewritten to reflect the discussionPollock and Hungerford concurred Hungerford added that theintent of the recommendation was not so much that integrating thescreen with the intervention gave better estimates of theperformance characteristics of the screen but that it wouldredress the imbalance betweenresearch emphasizing the performance characteristics andresearch on operational and practical characteristicsRecommendation  Interventions that have shown promise in otherclinical settings should be adapted to and evaluated in emergencydepartmentsCharles Bombardier wondered whether the recommendation shouldlimit evaluation only to interventions shown to be effective inother settings There might be interventions developed specificallyfor the ED that would be worthwhile to testWalker thought the goal of this recommendation was todeemphasize finegrained developmental work and to emphasizepursuing work using available interventionsWoolard noted that the effectiveness of screening briefinterventions and referrals has been proven outside the emergencydepartment but not yet in the ED Therefore he hoped that thesupporting text for this recommendation would include statementsabout the need for a large multicenter trial in EDsLongabaugh noted that new and creative interventions may bedeveloped in the ED that the rest of the field will want to adaptand exploreWalker made a plea not to adopt the abbreviation SBIR becauseit is already used to designate small business innovation researchgrants by federal agencies It could be very confusing Shesuggested SIR insteadSmith returned to the idea of linking alcohol interventions withthe other interventions in the ED If there were a package ofinterventions that providers could document and be reimbursed forthat would ease acceptance by practitioners and helpinstitutionalize these new practices Documentation would also helpensure interventions would not be repeated unnecessarilyPollock pointed out that proving the costeffectiveness of aspecified welldescribed service in a clinical setting is acritical consideration in moving a new practice from a researchendeavor to a reimbursable service Whether the service emerges asan adaptation from primary care or as an innovation from the ED isless important than whether it can be evaluated to the satisfactionof those who make key decisions about whether it becomes part ofstandard practiceLarry Gentilello asserted that effective treatments alreadyexist not just treatments that hold promise The promise hasto do with the interventions likelihood of success in the ED notwith its success in other settings He suggested that the wordingbe made less tentative for example treatments that work shouldbe made to work in the EDCatherine Gordon proposed that the recommendations address theissue of financing and suggested the following phrase Researchshould also identify the most effective and costeffectiveinterventions and delivery mechanisms eg provider types ortechnologies She said this type of information is absolutelycritical for insurersPollock asked Gordon whether research on alcohol interventionshad to be done in a specific clinical setting in order forinterventions provided in that setting to qualify forreimbursement He also asked how Medicare distinguishes betweenprevention and treatment for the purposes of authorizingreimbursementGordon explained that because Medicare is prohibited by statutefrom covering preventive services it must draw a distinctionbetween treatment and prevention The kind of information insurersrequire to cover these services includes necessary frequency oftreatment types of providers best suited to provide treatment anironclad case that the intervention is effective a consensus inthe professional community around the intervention and an abilityto guard against the potential for fraud and abusePollock added the notion that demonstrations of effectiveness inprimary care settings in the eyes of policymakers and payers arenot tantamount to demonstrating costeffectiveness in emergencydepartments underscoring the importance of research in thatsettingGordon agreedRecommendation  Research is needed to evaluate the effects oflegal privacy confidentiality regulatory and human subjectsissues on screening and interventions for alcohol problems among EDpatientsBrown praised the recommendation for addressing a very importantissue However he thought the human subjects aspect might notbelong because human subjects issues will not affect screening andintervention on a daily basis in the clinical setting They onlyaffect research studiesBombardier suggested that in addition to evaluation thisresearch should develop ways to mitigate legal privacy andconfidentiality problems associated with screening andtreatmentAnn Mahoney said the recommendation should be worded to focus onsystems as well as individuals For example she indicated that theconcerns institutional and professional systems have aboutreimbursement or legal privacy and confidentiality issuesinfluence whether ED patients receive screening andinterventionsHargarten commented that this area has the potential to causeconsternation and divisiveness so it will require a great deal oftextual commentary to tease out the important issues that itaddresses He noted that alcohol screening in the ED is currentlybeing discussed on the ethics circuit He suggested that perhapsethics should be added to the recommendationRecommendation  Research is needed on how demographic andcultural attributes of ED patients practitioners andinterventionists influence the success of screening andinterventions for alcohol problemsHargarten said there should be some reference in therecommendations to the highrisk environment in which these peoplelive and work and visit the ED He wondered if this recommendationwas the appropriate placeMarilyn Sommers noted that different clinical settings canprofoundly influence how screening and intervention is deliveredShe cited differences between Level I trauma centers and communityhospitals She suggested that the influence of setting be madeexplicit somewhere in the recommendationsAlison Moore indicated that these differences can also influencehow researchers and clinicians tailor interventions to apply topeople with different cultural attributesLi suggested that comorbidity or patients medicalcharacteristics could also have a large impact on the success ofinterventionsRecommendation  Research is needed to identify the factorsthat foster the organizational and practitioner behavior changesneeded to institutionalize screening and intervention for alcoholproblems among ED patientsWalker urged that this research not be confined to academicmedical centers but be designed and carried out in partnershipswith other stakeholders particularly communitylevel providersShe believed that this should be in the recommendation not justsupporting text because reviewers would want to know how screeningand intervention can be implemented into clinical practice whenconsidering grant applicationsRobert Lowe suggested a range of research topics could comeunder this recommendation Who should do interventions in the EDHow should ED interventions be linked to the primary care andpublic health systems Which services should be provided in the EDand which should be provided elsewhere How can referrals beeffectively accomplished How can interventions be paid for Hesuggested wording for the supporting text for this recommendationResearch in this category may address a broad range oforganizational issuesfrom the structure of alcohol and screeningtreatment services within the ED to the relationship of the ED toother sources of primary care and the organizational and fiscalfactors affecting that relationship This research is crucial asthe field progresses from evaluating efficacy in research settingsto examining effectiveness in the current complex health caredelivery systemBabor supported Lowes revision and suggested adding the wordimplementation to the recommendation Research is needed on howto implement and institutionalize these programs Factors to beexplored range from practitioner behavior and practice guidelinesto policy changes that are needed to facilitate implementation ofscreening and intervention in these settings If thisrecommendation is too narrowly defined we will encourage people tolook at small things like training programs However no matter howstrong a training program is if there are no incentives forpractitioners to use the training or the legal restrictions areinsurmountable or the health care system is in total chaos and youcannot find who is in charge of the department because somebody hasbought out the hospital you will have difficulty implementing aninterventionPeter Rostenberg noted that most trauma care is delivered incommunity hospitals and practitioners in that setting often do notrelate to Level I trauma care research Therefore he supportedincluding community hospitals in research efforts He thought thebiggest barrier was how to change the culture in the ED so thatstaff would ask screening questionsRies thought that the recommendations should encourage studyingoutcomes that are important to medical personnel such as healthcare outcomes and recidivism rather than alcohol use outcomesHargarten related that a recent survey found that almostonethird of academic EDs have faculty in community settings Hethought that encouraging this linkage in research proposals couldhelp increase this proportion He also suggested that involvingopinion leaders in the field of emergency medicine could helpreduce the lag time between academic research showing theeffectiveness of an intervention and broad implementation innonacademic clinical settingsPatricia Perry believed that the recommendation was not yetcomprehensive Hospital administrators merit mention because theyare key to wide implementation She thought state and federalpolicymakers should also be included in the statement She observedthat institutionalizing new practices was just the beginning of thetask Once they are in place the program needs to be maintainedShe wondered what factors influenced maintenancePat Lenaghan suggested that clinicians need recommendationsabout what could be accomplished now They need to know thatscreening works and that the sooner screening is implemented thesooner patients with alcohol problems can receive help She notedthat collaboration with community groups and public health agenciesis appropriate for alcohol problems because they are not justpresent in the ED She said that such collaboration has contributedto the success of domestic violence screening across thecountryBombardier noted that barriers exist among departments withininstitutions as well as among institutions He advocated developinginformation systems that follow patients so that data collected inthe ED can be used laterRonald Maio suggested defining the unique role of the emergencydepartment in the overall picture of treating alcohol problemsWhat can the emergency department do that cannot be done in othersettingsSoderstrom suggested that the term practitioner in thisrecommendation needs to be clarified because it can mean anyone whotakes care of a patient including RNs MDs therapists andothersBernstein noted that alcoholdependent patients clearly needspecialized treatment and that some patients with hazardousdrinking need outpatient counseling He said if access to thatcounseling is not available screening and interventions are lesslikely to happen in the ED He called for research on barriersemergency physicians face in getting further care for ED patientswith alcohol problemsHargarten wondered about supporting text that calls forpolicyrelevant research to institutionalize and to promoteorganizational changes He suggested that research on ways ofpaying for these services could be an important factor in promotingand institutionalizing changesRecommendation  Research is needed to explore and define therole of information technology in facilitating screening andintervention for alcohol problems among ED patientsBrown asked whether other forms of technology should beincluded such as audio tape headsetsJanet Williams suggested the phrase information andcommunication technology She said that these technologies canassist in followup and continuity of careRies commented that educational videos in waiting rooms can behelpfulHargarten added that telemedicine has a role in making thebooster intervention a realityRecommendation  Funding agencies should support research onscreening and interventions for alcohol problems among ED patientsand make the mechanisms of research supportknown to potentialapplicants in emergency medicineLongabaugh wanted the recommendation to include researchtraining as an explicit component He said that it has beendifficult to get good physician applicants for Brownspostdoctoral program in intervention and treatment researchHowever the program has produced a great deal of researchMechanisms to facilitate the training of good researchersparticularly ones from emergency medicine are needed and should beencouragedHargarten added that training mechanisms should not be limitedto physicians He suggested including nurses and PhDsDiesenhaus noted that agencies are required to fund differenttypes of research SAMHSA funds applied research and theirapplication program is oversubscribedBrown felt that the recommendation placed too muchresponsibility on funding agencies He suggested the recommendationencourage the emergency medicine academic organization to help itsmembers find other funding opportunities He thought there weremany opportunities through other organizations that should betappedGentilello said he has long supported placing a priority onresearch in this area However funding agencies cannot be forcedto accept this He agreed with Brown that professional societiesshould be clear about funding opportunities At the same time thedata indicate many missed opportunities for treatment in the EDFor some patients the ED visit is the only contact with themedical care system It can be their only opportunity forintervention and injuries are the most common events that bringpeople into contact with the emergency department We can present astrong case that work in the ED should be a high priorityPollock suggested that ED visits are crucial opportunities andthe supporting text for this recommendation can make that clear Itis possible to emphasize this topic without stating that it shouldtake precedence over other issues or have a certain amount ofresources devoted to itHungerford thought that work in the ED needed a higher priorityand more resources if the field is to move forwardPollock asked for a more specific definition ofprioritization It is unfortunate but in the eyes of funders itis perceived as a zero sum gameBernstein suggested that the supporting text for thisrecommendation would have to explain the need for politicalcommitment to changing the health and social outcomes resultingfrom alcohol problemsHargarten suggested that we do not have to ask federal agenciesto make research on alcohol problems in the ED a high priorityInstead we could recommend that compared with other settings theprevalence of alcohol problems among ED patients makes it worthy ofcareful consideration We can also recommend that research effortsshould include an ED focus and that emergency medicine expertsshould be included in the grant review process This strategy wouldattempt to broaden the focus of current research activities toinclude the EDLongabaugh commented that an NIAAA effort to conduct research onspirituality and addiction came about by setting aside fundsspecifically for this topic He said the way to accomplish this isto find and work with agency staff interested in the topic Hebelieved that data on the prevalence and severity of alcoholproblems in EDs can have a major impactRies agreed and suggested that this recommendation shouldpromote EDbased research by emphasizing the large number of EDpatients affected by alcohol problems and the significant healthcare impact of those problemsFiellin suggested the recommendation should ask for a level ofsupport that is commensurate with the burden of illnessGentilello pointed out that the literature includes randomized trials on brief interventions in family and generalpractice settings Three one in press are in emergency medicineThe emergency department at Harborview probably sees  times asmany patients with alcohol problems as the psychiatry or familymedicine departments If we were to choose one place to set up ascreening system to find people who need interventions it shouldbe the emergency department He said there needs to be a shift inprioritiesMary Dufour described how NIAAA sets research priorities Tosecure some funding for this conference she had to compete withother conferences which indicates that this issue is high on theNIAAA list of priorities NIAAA has a National Advisory Councilwith a subcommittee that helps to set research prioritiesInteracting with the Council is an important way to influenceresearch priorities she said Every three to five years NIAAAreviews its whole research portfolio it identifies gaps whichbecome research priorities Alcohol and injury as well as briefinterventions are on the list NIAAA is a small institution withmore priorities than moneyBrown suggested that the recommendation remain as is but thatthe supporting text list ways that priorities could be changedBecause drug use is also an important issue among ED patients hethought combining alcohol and drug research in EDs could lead tomore research dollars He noted a growing understanding of theimportance of screening for alcohol and other drugs together Toappeal to NIDA he said the referral aspect of the research shouldbe strong because of their focus on treatmentDiesenhaus agreed that both support from staff in an agency andthe burden of illness argument could be influential He said thatdemand for research in EDs from outside an agency would also beimportant He suggested that conference participants needed tointeract with individuals and groups that influence policyGentilello acknowledged that there is a demand problem The goalis to help trauma surgeons and emergency physicians realize thatdealing with alcohol problems is an integral part of their jobResearch on alcohol problems is as important as research on sepsisand CPR At the NIH web site he found no information onalcoholrelated research in the surgery section It was all in thealcohol section which surgeons do not explore If we want surgeonsto become interested it should be repeated in the surgerysectionLongabaugh remarked that NIH is increasingly trying toindividualize the routing of grant applications so that studysection members are a matter of public record If a study sectiondoes not include a relevant expert then a cover letter with thegrant application can request such an expertLi suggested that adding a reference to the Healthy People objective to reduce alcoholrelated injury and ED visits by might enhance the rationale for more researchGeneral comments about the recommendationsAfter participants had given extensive feedback on specificproposed recommendations Hungerford asked if they had generalcomments about the recommendations overallFiellin reflected on increasing information about the biologicalbasis for addictive disorders the increasing effectiveness ofpharmacotherapy and the fact that we are trying look at thesedisorders the same way we look at chronic medical conditions likehypertension and diabetes He asked whether we might initiatepharmocotherapy for patients with alcoholrelated problems in theED much like we initiate use of oral hypoglycemics andantihypertensives with some type of followup
