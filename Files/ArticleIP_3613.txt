                                 AvantGarde My Derri            By JacobWeisberg                           posted Thursday July                         Walkinginto the SoHo branch of the Guggenheim Museum you are received by an enormousinflatable dominatrix lying on her back She wears fishnet stockings and ateddy festooned with baby doll heads and holds a whip In other respects theimage is that of an Asian kewpie dollpowdered face braids tassels and asilk gown The irregularly shaped dirigible on which the photograph of thisamalgamated woman is superimposed is connected to foot pumps From the balconyat entrance level you can step down on these pumps blowing air into thesculpture below                           Hydra               Monument is a selfportrait by the South Koreaborn Lee Bul one ofsix finalists for the Hugo Boss Prizea biennial competition for cuttingedgeartists sponsored by the German menswear manufacturer that takes place at theGuggenheim Museums SoHo branch Lee is the most inyourface of the group Herprevious works include Abortion  a  performance piece in which shehung upside down and naked from the gallery ceiling talking about her abortionand reciting song lyrics In another series  she exhibited rotting fishdecorated with beads and sequins supposedly to create a biting satire onwomens servitude in a maledominated culture according to the exhibitioncatalog            Lees approach and preoccupations are characteristic notonly of the Boss prize finalists but of contemporary conceptual art in generalHer work is theory driven and eschews traditional technique It is based on themanipulation of preexisting images rather than the coinage of new ones Byappropriating and commenting on them Lee like the other artists in the Bossshow aims at a critique of the dominant culture The key buzzword echoingthrough the catalog is otherness a term borrowed from formerly trendy Frenchliterary criticism Minus the obscurantism the idea is that culturaldifferenceracial sexual and national though never religiousis thefundamental and brutal truth of modern existence            Elsewhere on the leftthis view is at least subject to argument and criticism Only in the art worldis radical multiculturalism an unquestionable dogma There is not even a flashof recognition of the irony that this philosophy manifests itself in a biginternational art show where brings together artists of every racenationality and sexual orientation to proclaim that they are despised andignored But whatever the merits of essentialism as an outlook on life its artworld fruits as displayed in the Boss exhibition are flavorless andrepetitive By the end what you have learned is that in contemporary art theother is always pretty much the same            The Guggenheim has essentially ruled out conventional formssuch as painting drawing printmaking or sculpture preferring art that isprocessoriented to art that is static Four of the other five finalistspresent video installations The wonderfully named Pipilotti Rist a Swiss whoused to be in a rock band makesin the guise of commenting on racy musicvideoswhat are essentially dull racy music videos Her chief submission to the Bossprize is an installation titled  an underwater sequence set to her own versionof Chris Isaaks song Wicked Games which Rist sings and then shrieksProjected in mirror image on two screens joined at right angles it turnsimages of the artist cavorting underwater along with various objects such as acheese grater and a TV set into a kind of giant vaginascope Of the artistsrepresented Rist is the only one who approximates a sense of humor and its afairly distant approximation            Levity is not part ofthe repertoire of the AfricanAmerican artist Lorna Simpson Simpson haspreviously exhibited photographs of black women accompanied by bits of cryptictext For example a print of in a dilapidated apartment one in sunglasseswith a drink the other peering across the room bears the legend forecastingvisibility from the office According to the catalog Simpsons pictures ofwomen staring blankly underscore that they are unheard in a racistpatriarchal society Lately she has moved into film Her entry in the Bossprize competition is a nine minute blackandwhite piece titledRecollection  in which several women conduct disjointed conversations onthe theme of forgetfulness            Arguably the most banal work in the show comes from theScottish artist Douglas Gordon Gordon is a Glaswegian previously known forhaving one of his forefingers tattooed completely black and taking  andanother in which he slowed down the film Psycho to a speed at which ittook  hours to watch One Gordon contribution is a piece of insipid texttitled  lettered in white on a blue wall Statements such as hot is coldform a kind of word palindrome that makes Jenny Holzer seem deep Gordonsother work is archival footage projected on two freestanding video screensHysterical uses film from  of two Italian men putting amasked woman through some sort of psychological treatment            More inventive thanGordon is the Chinese artist Huang Yong Ping who was caught abroad during theTiananmen Square uprising and now lives in Paris Huang is also interested inthe conflict between Western and Eastern cultures but seems less enraged on thetopic than Lee His previous work has involved putting books through a washingmachine cycle and collecting live animals such as scorpions snakes andinsects and setting them to battle in enclosures filled with Chinese artobjects Huangs installation for the Boss prize the largest work in the showis called The Saint Learns From the Spider to Weave a Cobweb  Its alattice of copper pipes from which hang a chair and a dozen mesh cages Insideeach cage is a hairy live tarantula The title refers to the Taoist Ge Hongwho wrote that animals are superior to human beings Reminiscent of theroomfilling iron spiders cast by Louise Bourgeois it conveys the feeling ofbeing trapped in a philosophical cageand in so doing perfectly captures thespirit of the exhibition as whole            Because the  prize to be announced July  is forthe artists whole oeuvre and not the work submitted for the show Iwould award it if forced to choose to South African William Kentridge who isknown for powerful  many with antiapartheid themes Unfortunately followingthe vogue of conceptualism Kentridge has entered a film in the show  whichuses animation of sketches much cruder than the ones he usually doesinterspersed with documentary footage from the apartheid era Set against thesolipsistic identity politics of the rest of the show Kentridges oldschoolagitprop is nearly refreshing            It is perhaps unsurprisingthat a prize endowed by Hugo Boss should end up being less about craft thanabout fashion What makes the exhibition truly dreary however is the pretensethat its daring when really its an exercise in intellectual conformity Allthe avantgarde artists included are actually academic both in the sense ofderiving their ideas about cultural difference from French literary critics andin the sense that they follow the dictates of others about what art should beSubtract the shock value and what you have here is the salon painting of thes                           If youmissed the link about the irony of Hugo Boss sponsorship of
