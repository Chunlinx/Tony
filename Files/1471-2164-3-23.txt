                    Background                  Hypothesis formulation          The assessment of bias in dinucleotide relative          abundance begins with the odds ratios           r                       xy                       f                       xy                       f                       x                      f                       y            where           f                       x            denotes the normalized frequency of nucleotide          base           x and           f                       xy            is the frequency of dinucleotide base step           xy in the leading strand These          ratios compare observed dinucleotide frequencies to those          expected from the base composition alone under the          assumption of statistical independence ie thorough          shuffling of the sequence When           r                       xy            is greater less than one           xy is overunderrepresented The          symmetrized version           r                        xy            is computed from frequencies of the sequence          concatenated with its inverted complement The numbers            r                        xy             comprise the dinucleotide relative abundance          profile                 The statistical problem is to test the hypotheses that          patterns of dinucleotide over and underrepresentation          in a given genome are invariant Using symbol           f for frequencies in windows let           g be used to represent the global          frequencies computed for a complete sequence a genome or          chromosome The hypothesis asserts that           r                        xy            in any window is approximately equal to a constant          This constant is the global signature           c                        xy                       g                        xy                       g                        x                      g                        y                      Karlin Landunga and Blaisdell    assessed          homogeneity of the dinucleotide relative abundance          profile through the deltadistance                r                        xy                       c                        xy             They provided standards for classifying  in           kb windows as follows random               very close      close               moderately related               and distantly related               The upper limit of the random range which          typifies thoroughly shuffled sequences scales as            n  where           n is the number of bases in the          window          The local stability of           r                       xy            would be an ancillary result under the assumption of          a stationary stochastic process since then the          frequencies converge in probability to fixed limits           f                       x                       p                       x            and           f                       xy                       f                       x                       p                       xy            as           n   The simplest case would be a          homogeneous Markov chain with base step transition          probabilities           p                       xy            and stationary base composition           p                       x             In this case the differences           f                       x                       p                       x            and           f                       xy                       f                       x                       p                       xy            tend to zero as            n and it is clear that           r                       xy                       p                       xy                       p                       y            will vanish at the same rate     Moreover the          globally computed quotient           c                       xy                       g                       xy                       g                       x                      g                       y            would be a consistent estimate of           p                       xy                       p                       y             Thus the separate terms of             r                       xy                       c                       xy             tend to zero as            n and the same must obviously apply          to           We start however with the understanding that the          sequence is fundamentally nonstationary exhibiting          statistically significant variations in base frequencies          between nonoverlapping windows      Locally or          globally estimated Markov models may describe it better          than assuming that the bases are independent and          identically distributed    but they fail to reflect          the salient features of natural sequences     For          example Robin and Daudin    compared the frequency          of a specific motif in the genome sequence of           Haemophilus influenzae to Markovian          predictions and found that the observed frequencies were          everywhere higher than predicted          This point aside the stationary Markov analogy          provides a useful benchmark in assessing local stability          of the genomic signature If nucleotide sequences behaved          like Markov chains then            n would not depend on           n  We will examine this           scaled deltadistance            n to see if it exhibits any trend          A decreasing superMarkov trend would imply that          signature stability emerges as the scale increases and          could indicate the breakdown of stability for some window          size below  kb                          Scope of the investigation          This survey examines  sequences from  species and           genera The sequences are listed in Table along with          serial numbers            SN  and letter abbreviations            Abbr  Most of them have been          previously studied and found to show stability of the          genomic signature in  kb windows     The shortest          is the  kb complete genome of           Mycoplasma genitalium  The longest          complete sequence is the  kb           human chromosome XXII           The selected sequences which are not always complete          genomes fall into two main classes being typically           the chromosome that constitutes the largest single          element in a prokaryotic genome or  one of the          chromosomes in a eukaryotic genome In the first case          for example is the           Borrelia burgdorferi sequence that          excludes  identified plasmids The second case is          exemplified by           Plasmodium falciparum where          chromosomes II and III are selected to the exclusion of          the other  Since our investigation focuses on scaling          properties of the genomic signature it is appropriate to          consider sequences comprised of many  kb contigs          assuming that variation between such contigs is small          compared to variation between species          The present sample which spans a wide range of GC          proportion is hoped diverse enough that any consistent          trends and features in the statistical picture it          produces cannot be easily attributed to chance A broader          range of sequences including mitochondrial and large          viral genomes has been surveyed by Karlin           et al          using           kb and larger windows This investigation which applies          similar methodology to smaller window sizes concerns the          intragenomic homogeneity of dinucleotide relative          abundance and intersequence distance calculations are          beyond its scope          Our use of nonoverlapping windows is consistent with          the methodology employed in prior studies using  kb and          longer windows Overlapping windows with a high          percentage overlap would be required to localize and sort          out the significance of nonconforming segments that could          possibly reflect a foreign signature Overlap would          introduce statistical dependence between successive          windows and such dependence could only complicate the          analysis of variance within sequences Window size was          varied by factors of approximately two the specific          values being  kb  kb  kb  kb  kb  kb           b  b and  b                            Results and discussion                  Increasing trend in mean scaled          deltadistance          Table shows mean scaled deltadistance by sequence            Abbr  and window size            n  Scaled deltadistance defined          above as            n  is a statistical invariant for          any benchmark sequence generated by a Markov chain          exhibiting the same signature as the given sequence          Except for the           Borrelia burgdorferi sequence the          mean scaled deltadistance is increasing in window size          for every sequence The lone exception is a drop for           B burgdorferi  from  to           as window size increases from  kb to  kb          The essentially increasing trend in            n has an obvious implication for          the scalability of standard binning levels used in          classifying intragenomic deltadistance     These          levels cannot be rescaled by the reciprocal square root          of window size without admitting that the profiles seen          through smaller windows are statistically closer to the          global signature The profiles seen through larger          windows obviously tend toward the signature but local          fluctuations tend to zero slower than            n ie the convergence rate is          subMarkov                          Quasistable hierarchy of mean scaled          deltadistances          The rows of Table are grouped as archaea            Aful Mjan  protist            Pfa Pfa  yeast            Sc Sc  plant            Ath  human            Hs  or bacteria all           others Rows are averaged in groups and the results are          plotted in Figure  Granted that the curves for archaea          and bacteria are almost indistinguishable we see that          ranking mean scaled delta distances by groups produces          about the same result for every window size The one          clear exception is the crossing of the curves for plant                     Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome          IV  and human            chromosome XXII  between           n   kb and           n   kb Thus the view through           kb windows shows that the imprint of the global signature          is weaker in the latter but  kb and smaller windows          show relatively clearer imprints in the human          chromosome                          Normality and homoscedasticity of log delta          The increasing trend in all the curves of Figure          suggests that local deviations from the global signature          are better described by a multiplicative error process          instead of additive Therefore we examine the natural          logarithms of the deltadistances in windows and find          that they are close to normally distributed with nearly          constant variance over the range of window size Mean          values of log are shown in Table with corresponding          standard deviations in Table           Each pair of corresponding cells in Tables and          defines a normal distribution with mean a variance          determined by a sample of observed deltadistances Each          sample is subjected to the KolmogorovSmirnov test of fit          to the corresponding normal distribution     We          generate a random sample of the same size as the observed          sample from a normal distribution with the same          parameters The KolmogorovSmirnov twosample test is          then invoked The null hypothesis is that the observed          and simulated samples share a common underlying          distribution Pvalues from the test which measure          support for the null hypothesis of normality are shown          in Table  The bottom row of Table counts by window          size the number of times the test accepts normality of          log at the  significance level          Deltadistances tend to fit the lognormal          distribution better for window sizes  kb and larger          Rejection of lognormality for the smallest window sizes          is to some extent a consequence of increasing sample          size The apparent goodnessoffit actually gets better          as window size decreases as illustrated in Figure for          three indicated window sizes on the           Haemophilus influenzae sequence          The sample CDF approaches a smooth curve as window size          declines and the number of windows increases The heavy          plotted points are from lognormal distribution functions          with means and variances of the corresponding          samples                          SubMarkov convergence rate of mean log          delta          Since            n is essentially increasing in           n  we infer that the locally          computed dinucleotide relative abundance converges to the          global signature more slowly than the reciprocal square          root of window size The lognormality of the          intragenomic delta distance suggests a loglinear model          of the form log    log           n  for intercept  and slope           coefficients that can be estimated for each sequence or          group by simple linear regression Table  columns           and  give intercept and slope coefficients of least          squares fits to the scatter plots of mean log versus          log           n  Column  gives the mean          absolute residual MAR to indicate the closeness of the          straight line fit All estimated slope coefficients are          greater than the benchmark value  implied by the          Markovian analogy Figure shows least squares fits to          loglog scatter plots obtained by grouping rows of Table          in the same as way described above for going from Table          to Figure                           Weakly consistent patterns of intragenomic          variability in deltadistance          Residual accumulated deltadistance RADD is defined          as window size times the cumulative sum of terms            t   mean           t               T where           t is the position index counted in          windows from the  end and           T is the total number of windows          Here mean is just the average of unscaled          deltadistances in windows of size           n  Since              T             T mean a plot of RADD versus           t always returns to zero The RADD          plot will superficially resemble random walks obtained by          integrating counts of purine minus pyrimidine bases Such          walking plots are useful in depicting long range          compositional biases concomitant to replication    and          their selfsimilarity with respect to rescaling has been          said to instantiate the fractal geometry of nature                        Here we use the RADD plot to examine how well          deltadistances in smaller windows are smoothed by          corresponding larger windows For example take a single           kb window on the           M genitalium sequence compute its          deltadistance from the global signature then divide it          into  contiguous  kb windows and repeat the          calculation for each piece Do the  deltadistances          exhibit random fluctuations about the level indicated by          the single larger window If so the patterns would be          judged consistent and that result would typify a          stationary process Such consistency is only weakly          evidenced In Figure  however as larger scales give          rise to emergent trends The same effect is seen in          Figure where the  b and  kb traces track each other          closely but diverge from the other traces in the central          region                            Conclusions        The imprint of the global signature is locally pervasive        on all scales considered in the sequences that were        scanned No lower bound can yet be placed on the local        scale on which the global signature is reflected The        intergenomic hierarchy of mean intragenomic        deltadistances is essentially preserved across the range        of window sizes Intragenomic deltadistance is        approximately lognormally distributed in windows down to         kb and the variance of logdelta is fairly uniform        across the set of sequences Deltadistance tends to zero        with increasing window size but the rate of this        convergence is significantly slower than for simple random        processes                    Methods        The sequences listed in Table were downloaded from the        National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank           in FASTA format and saved as plain text files The        last two columns of Table provide GenBank accession        numbers and approximate dates of the revisions used in this        analysis The sequences as text files were processed by        routines written in SPlus Version  The texts were read        in blocks contigs of  kb when computing        deltadistances in  kb and  kb windows or  kb for        smaller windows Counts of overlapping base steps in        windows were computed with the last base of one window        serving as the first base of the next Thus the number of        base steps in a window is equal to the number of bases not        one less However one base step was uncounted at the        start of every block Incomplete windows in the last block        were discarded and blocks past endoffile were ignored        Sometimes complete blocks near endoffile were omitted        With the exception of         Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome IV         the total sequence lengths in kilobases are listed in the        fourth column          kb  of Table  All corresponding        sample lengths are at least  of total length and most        are close to  when texts were read in  kb blocks For                A thaliana  however the global        signature was computed from a scan of the  complete        sequence but local deltadistances from the global        signature were computed only for the first  of the        complete sequence due to computing difficulties The         kb length for this sequence in Table is therefore about        half the total bases in the chromosome
