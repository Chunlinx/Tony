        okay   all right well ill just start by saying that we we spend our time you know having a formal dinner on on the weekend and thats when we try and get together it might be breakfast it might be and we try and talk about   yeah   things and we try we have dinner every night too but not everybody is always there our daughters are fifteen seventeen and twenty   how old are they oh wow   and um   are they all living at home   they are at home um our oldest daughter is going to be a senior at SMU   oh wow   so shes home for summer school and living at home um right now and we we but we very rarely do things as a whole family   yeah well when they were little though you did didnt you   yes yes we used to like   yeah because theyre all close enough in age that you would have had to take them all   yeah oh yeah we we used to like to go to oh parades the circus um you know we used to like to take them to the park um we had a we have a swimming pool at our house which weve had since they were very small   yeah oh thats nice   so we we have many memories of swimming um together in the afternoons you know and by the pool and the girls uh learned to swim when they were real little you know three and   yeah and then they had their parties there and all that   yes they had their their pool parties um so that was one of the things we did together was the most uh i guess the most often was swim by the swim in the pool thats   yeah well see i mean you know since we havent had our children yet but um the thing that my husband and i do could very easily be incorporated with children because we like to go camping and we like to we have a boat so we go in the boat all the time and so   oh thats great if you like to do those two things   yeah and so you know those things could children could very easily go you know and just go with the flow   very easily yes yes i think you will enjoy that i we never camped and we we arent we arent into boating either uh mainly because my husband doesnt like boats that much and he uh   oh   its mainly what i you know what he wanted to do and and hes a swimmer hes a golfer   yeah   so uh   did he teach them how to play golf   well he has taken them out on the golf course but he hasnt and theyve never showed any any any real interest its got not enough action for for the children you know so um but we we like to um   yeah yeah   but now you know now next weekend were taking them to a show were taking them down to Fair Park to see Chorus Line   oh really   and thats kind of their reward for a school year successful school year   yeah well thats a great one   so were were doing that   well that will be fun   but um but i you know as far as having a family it sounds like youve got some good ideas   yeah its   how about your families are they close by your immediate your um   uh my parents are in Oklahoma and i have my oldest sister lives there with her two kids and these are the only grandchildren at this point so theyre getting tons of attention but um theyre a lot of fun and   umhum   my nephews in to tee ball and so they spend a lot of time but theyre in this little bitty small hole in the road town so you know they have a lot of time that they can spend with their kids   umhum yes thats nice   and thats you know that was another question that my husband and i had is that what we have four dogs and we barely have time to play with them     four dogs well thats   yeah yeah those are my children right now   yeah i think thats i think thats a bridge that everybody uses to get used to taking the responsibility of caring for something and then   yeah well it was real funny because we were walking out of a store one morning and he turned to me and he said did you feed the kids this morning and i said no didnt you and this lady looked at us like we were child abusers and  so we had to explain to her we were talking about our dog     thats great yeah thats cute because i know our dog i didnt think he got fed this morning but our our daughter fed him because we have we have two daughters that are away right now theyre at a camp     oh yeah   uh uh not a camp theyre on a choir tour thats were they are so theyre theyre gone so its just me and our older daughter here this week but um but you will um i i think thats neat that youre going to start a family and and um   oh yeah yeah its   and and i know everybody around you your family will be very supportive and very anxious too im sure   oh yeah they they   i i have to tell you that um grandparents are very important to have close by i think and ours were never close by   oh i know it really well see mine since like i said my family my my parents started out so late having us my grandparents all but one was already dead even when before i was born so i didnt get to have that but   thats interesting   i had aunts and uncles that were so close to me that you know replaced grandparents i think in every way   umhum yeah yeah so how old is your little   so its really neat that i can do that now with my niece and nephew   well how old are your parents now then   um my mothers seventy five and my dads seventy three   yeah yeah well thats exactly how old my parents are   so oh really   yeah and um but but they are the reversed my dads seventy five my moms seventy well actually my moms seventy two my dad   oh well theyre a lot of fun now   yeah im sure im sure they are   but also it was neat too because um there was so much age difference between my sisters and me that i was kind of like the only child and so mother and i did tons of things together we i mean she didnt drive but shed load me up on a bus and wed go across country and just had the best time   yes isnt that wonderful   yeah it was really neat so we were really close but thats   oh you must have such great memories of that   oh i do its really neat yeah because it was real funny because in high school all my friends were fighting with their mothers  and i wasnt i was having a ball i mean on spring break that   that is so good isnt that thats really interesting   yeah on spring break id go with mother to the horse races and all my friends would go to Padre Island   oh that is great i because thats very thats rare   oh yeah it was so much fun   yeah because i was the im the oldest of four and we had a we have a very close knit family and i i just i am just very blessed   oh really yeah   but being the oldest i had you know the responsibility of of doing a lot i have two younger brothers and a sister a younger sister so um   uhhuh oh well see thats another thing that scares me about having kids because i was the baby so i havent even really been around kids   yes yes well youll well you have your niece your nephew and to to look at that and and learn from that and you can read lots of good books   yeah yeah oh yeah   but um but thats real fun so and youre in Carrollton yeah and where what what church do you go to do you   uhhuh were Methodist   oh good yeah so are we   yeah  yeah so   yeah weve been in Plano for thirteen years   oh really   and uh our kids have grown up here and i think i think Plano   yeah   i think the fact that you have the boating and the camping is a good good thing i think its hard for parents to find things to do with their kids once the sports arent there   oh yeah yeah well   you know anymore like we have we always have the baseball games to go to that the kids are in and the you know tee ball soccer stuff like that but uh after they as they get older its harder to find things to do together   uhhuh yeah yeah well we have all i mean and i both have camped since we were little with our parents and so i think its very natural and im sure thats the way it will be and oh weve already looked in the   yeah   catalog to to find a little baby ski jacket   oh oh thats great       well where do you go camping   um we go to Lake Whitney a lot which is its a beautiful lake and then we go to Arkansas   oh yeah well i was just down near there i i had to drive to Austin last week and on Thursday last Thursday as a matter of fact my i saw the sign   oh really oh yeah   and uh i didnt know it was pretty i just i   oh its a very pretty lake   well thats good   yeah its its real clear which is kind of unusual for Texas lakes   yeah and they have campgrounds   oh yeah they have some great camp grounds and then we like to go to Arkansas too because thats where i camped when i was little and theres some beautiful lakes there   yeah yeah yeah well thats interesting i am not timing this conversation because i guess youre supposed to be in control it says   so yeah well yeah but i just kind of keep talking until we quit     well this is my first call so um yeah yeah i i enjoy uh this is really going to be a neat thing i think   oh really yeah yeah i do too   but um  i its its i think im going to need a pencil you know to to jot down what they say in the beginning and that because its hard theyre its like
