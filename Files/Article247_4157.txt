                                 Are Bush and McCain Really Neck and Neck                        A recent poll found that John McCain leads George W Bush among NewHampshire Republicans by  percentage points with a  percent margin of errorDoes this mean they are really in a dead heat            Possibly You actually need two numbers to understand a poll One is themargin of error an estimate of how large a discrepancy might existbetween a surveys results and the true value Its unlikely for instancethat  people polled in some national survey will speak accurately for all million Americans The margin of error measures just how wrong those people could be The margin of error is typically  to  percent and is almostalways cited alongside the results The other important number is the degreeof confidence  which is the likelihood that the real value falls within themargin of error Most polls use a  percent degree of confidence so itsusually omitted from news reports            Heres an example of how the two numbers work together This week aReutersWHDHTV poll showed McCain leading Bush  percent to  percent with a percent margin of error This means that there is a  percent chancetheres the degree of confidence that between  and  percent of thepopulation supports McCain thats McCains  percent plus or minus the marginof error and a  percent chance that between  and  percent supportsBush            So based on this poll how sure can we be that McCain is truly ahead ofBush The answer is less than  percent sure The reported margin of errorrelates to each candidates individual score But the margin of error onthe spread ie the difference between their scores is much larger since itincorporates the potential variations in both scores As a rule ofthumb you can multiply the reported margin of error by  to get the marginof error for the spread Since  times  is  the ReutersWHDHTV surveywould need to show McCain with at least an  percent advantage over Bush forhis lead to be  percent certain Since his lead is only three percentagepoints its being called a dead heat But the small lead is not meaninglessalthough it is less than  percent certain that McCain leads Bush it is stillmore likely than not that he is really ahead            Visit the American Statistical Associations Web sitefor extensive information on common methodsand errorsin measuring publicopinion                           The Explainer thanks many                Slate                readers for suggesting thistopic                        Next question
