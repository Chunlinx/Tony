               well if youre from Iowa you must be very artsycraftsy everyone ive ever known from the Midwest can do everything with their hands   okay oh well  actually im from California and before then i was from Utah so   i didnt know anyone ever moved from California to Kansas Iowa   well i grew up in California and then i went to school in Utah and i got married there and we stayed there for a while and then now were in Utah Iowa   im teasing only because im from Indiana i really liked i like the Midwest   oh really   oh   but i married a Texan and they have a way of dragging you back home       anyway were supposed to be talking about crafts do you um do you have any hobbies that that you do things with your hands like knitting or   um well i crochet and i do water color and i um sew and i do fabric painting   oh you do a lot then do you do needlepoint also and cross stitching   um ive done some cross stitching i havent tried any needlepoint yet how about you   um actually i im pretty untalented  i used to do a lot of knitting and crocheting um   oh right   but i i dont know somehow i i dont have the time anymore but i have all these friends that wherever you go they they sit down and the next thing you know they pull out of their um bags some their most recent uh needle craft     oh really   and in December everyone was doing stockings you know these gorgeous detailed minute tiny stitch stockings   uhhuh oh God oh yeah well those take a lot of time i only can do things that are pretty fast because   yes   we just um got our baby last year and i just dont have the patience to just you know be some  uhhuh   is this your first baby have you crocheted or knitted any baby clothes or baby blankets   um i crocheted an afghan for our bed thats the only thing and and i did a quilt lets see ive done a quilt for our baby and ive done a quilt for our bed but i mean   did you embroidery the pattern and then quilt it yourself or   um   how how did you make a quilt     um our babys quilt it was a pre like the design i just went around the design in the quilt i didnt piece it or anything like that   uhhuh   but uh   but you actually hand quilted it yourself   uhhuh and  just   did did you need a loom or were you able was it small enough that you could just hold it   um i put it on the frame the quilting frame have you are you familiar with that yeah okay   uhhuh but um my again my mother back in Indiana we had a quilting frame in our basement and she would she would quilt whole quilts by herself   oh my God   um yes which i was always amazed i have one of them um but uh you know to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that its a tremendous amount of work   well i havent done tons of them but um i used to do more before um before i had  before we got our baby but   have you think children you can um use crafts to make wonderful things for children   uhhuh   i think when babies i think afghans and and the crocheted little sweaters and are are wonderful and and theyll wear them  once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear your   yeah exactly well one thing that i like about this fabric painting thing is i can just make a Tshirt and put a little ruffle around it and then um cut out a little pattern from the material from some material like flowers or something and make um a design or you know a little arrangement or something on the shirt and you know fuse it on with Heat and Bond or whatever and then paint around it and i usually sew sew around the flower whatever first and then i paint around it so you cant see the stitching as much does does that make sense to you   oh yes i think its very clever its uh funny that you said for Christmas my daughter and i received matching sweat shirts that a friend had made for ours a beautiful Christmas design and they were matching and they were lovely   so oh   but when i washed them although i took the precaution of turning them inside out i really didnt do anything else and truly everything fell off or most of it so i had i went and bought just some   oh sure uhhuh oh really   cloth glue and glued it all back and i bought the paint and redid most of the edges and and it was salvageable and i   oh   but its so im familiar with that but i think youre very clever to um sew around the edges i think gluing alone certainly if you wash it any amount of time it tends to kind of come loose at the edges   well yeah someone told me that that it that they had done it both ways and ive always after hearing that i always sewed it on even even with the uh a loose zigzag even helps and um
