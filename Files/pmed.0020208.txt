                            On May   the Public Library of Science and the Government Accountability        Project a public interest legal group that advises and supports whistleblowers        wwwwhistleblowerorg cosponsored a private meeting near the Capitol Building in        Washington D C In the room were four of the most high profile medical whistleblowers of        recent times All four have gone public with information about practices in medicine and        medical research that they believe are risking the publics health or safety  One of        them was David Graham Associate Director in the United States Food and Drug        Administrations FDAs Office of Drug Safety whose research on rofecoxib Vioxx pointed        to the serious cardiovascular risks of the drug  Graham was speaking in his own        capacity and was not representing the FDA An anonymous fifth whistleblowera research        scientist at a major drug companyparticipated by phone        The whistleblowers took turns to share their stories including their accounts of        retaliations they said they had faced from their employers on raising their concerns which        led to lawsuits by at least two of the whistleblowers  The picture that emerged from        these accountsa picture of American medicines inappropriate ties with the pharmaceutical        industrywas deeply troubling        As the investigative medical journalist Jeanne Lenzer reports in her Essay for         PLoS Medicine  the whistleblowers spoke of public regulatory agencies        that are putting the interests of drug companies ahead of the safety of patients and of        pharmaceutical companies that allow their marketing departments to knowingly downplay        serious side effects when promoting their drugs And they spoke of the woefully inadequate        protection offered to those in the medical community who feel morally compelled to blow the        whistle        It was Lenzer who conceived the idea for the meeting She believed that important        lessons would emerge from having these medical whistleblowers who come from very different        professional backgrounds together in one room to share their experiences It took her many        months of planning In particular she needed to gain the trust of the industry research        scientist so that the scientist could feel sure that anonymity would be preserved But all        of her planning nearly came to nothing At the last moment the original journal sponsor        pulled out on the advice of its lawyers                                            The picture that emerged from these accounts was deeply troubling                                      Lenzers phone call to PLoS enquiring whether we might step in came just ten days        before the event was due to happen We took our own legal advice and then agreed to sponsor        the roundtable PLoS was eager to support this event and willing to accept any small legal        risks because we believe that the issues raised will be of huge interest to the medical        community to the press to patients and to the broader public Further the event fits        well with our own public service mission of making all scientific and medical research        results freely and publicly available and with our belief that transparency in the conduct        and publication of research is important for public trust And the topic of the roundtable        was in line with other articles we have published highlighting the many ways in which        medicine has become tightly entangled with industry to the great detriment of patients                The risks to a journal in sponsoring such an event are of course much smaller than the        risks that the whistleblowers at the roundtable faced in going public with their stories        Studies have shown that whistleblowers in both public service and private industry almost        always experience retaliation from their employers with those employed longer experiencing        greater retaliation  They risk loss of earnings intimidation harassment        victimization and personal abuse and they traditionally receive little help from        statutory authorities         The Washington whistleblowers stories illustrate these issues Psychiatrist Stefan        Kruszewski described how he was fired from his job at the Pennsylvania Department of Public        Welfare DPW after alerting his seniors to prescribing practices across the state that he        considered to be alarming and dangerous  I was fired in a demeaning manner said        Kruszewski who has sued DPW over his firing My two offices were emptied and the contents        of these offices were put in the gutter David Grahamwho testified at a US Senate Finance        Committee hearing on rofexocib Vioxx the FDA and Merck said that there was a        conspiracy by senior management at the FDA to intimidate me ahead of the Senate        testimony Both of these individuals contend that pharmaceutical industry influence over        their employers a state and a federal regulatory agency respectively played a part in        the difficulties these individuals faced in getting their concerns heard         Lenzers report will we hope spark discussion and debate about how American        medicineclinicians researchers regulatory agencies and medical journalscan disentangle        itself from the influence of the pharmaceutical industry In the past medical journals and        their editors have played an important part in exposing the complex relationships between        the pharmaceutical industry and medicine  including between industry and the        medical journals themselves          PLoS Medicine will continue to look critically at these relationships A        common theme at the roundtable was that armed with information the public too could have        an important role in unpicking these ties The pharmaFDA complex has to be dismantled        said Graham and the American people have to insist on that otherwise were going to have        disasters like Vioxx that happen in the future Patients health professionals and even        the industry itself all surely stand to gain from disentanglement
