                    Background        Although there have been major developments in its        diagnosis and treatment the mortality rate of septic shock        has progressively increased over the past few decades The        mortality rate can be as high as  in cases with        multiorgan failure     and several pharmacological        agents have been used in an effort to reduce this        percentage            In endotoxic shock bacterial endotoxin enters the        systemic circulation and triggers the release of        proinflammatory mediators Prostaglandin is released        during inflammatory reactions causing an increase in        microvascular hydrostatic pressure which is a primary        cause of edema and a contributory factor in hypovolemia                    Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents NSAIDs such as        acetyl salicylic acid and indometasin have been used in        the treatment of sepsis and septic shock and an        improvement in survival has been noted Several researchers        have also evaluated ibuprofen and beneficial effects on        pathophysiological changes have been observed     The        first major study of ibuprofen in endotoxic shock was        performed by Jacobs         et al     This study indicated        that ibuprofen can limit the degree of hypotension and        acidosis and decrease the cardiac index in endotoxic        shock Fink         et al     reported that ibuprofen        restored the normal hemodynamic pattern However Hulton         et al     saw no major metabolic        effect in         E coli sepsis Coran         et al    showed that the        administration of ibuprofen in septic shock in dogs did not        reduce cytokine levels Herbertson         et al    showed that ibuprofen        administration in endotoxic shock in pigs could prevent the        early hemodynamic changes following entotoxemia but not        the later changes Bernard         et al     reported that in        patients with sepsis treatment with ibuprofen reduced        levels of prostacylin and thromboxane and decreased fever        tachycardia oxygen consumption and lactic acidosis but        did not prevent the development of shock or acute        respiratory distress syndrome and did not improve        survival        Despite several studies using ibuprofen in endotoxic and        septic shock models there are some conflicting results        with respect to survival and there are few studies using        pretreatment with ibuprofen In this study we        investigated the effects of ibuprofen on physiological        parameters and survival in pre and posttreated rabbits        with experimentally induced endotoxic shock                    Methods                  Preparation of

randomly divided into four groups of          seven animals In Group I control  mL isotonic saline          was given by intravenous infusion and  mL blood samples          to obtain basal vital measurements and biochemical          parameters were taken simultaneously at                and  minutes The rabbits in Groups II III          and IV study groups received  mL sterile saline at           minute intervals for  minutes after which the          sampling and injection frequency was increased to every           minutes Sterile saline was given to Group I for the          duration of

parameter in both Groups III and IV was lower          than in Group II p   There was no significant          difference in respiratory rate between Groups III and IV          p   Table and Fig                           Heart rate          In Group II rabbits which received endotoxin heart          rates significantly increased between  and  minutes          compared to t            p

at  minutes but this was not statistically          significant p            When all groups were compared heart rates at  min          in both Groups II and III were significantly higher than          in Group I p   Heart rates in Group IV were          not significantly different from the control group p            but were significantly lower than both Groups          II and III p   Table and Fig                           Mean arterial pressure          MAP levels showed an obvious decrease at  minutes in          group II which received only endotoxin from t             MAP levels gradually decreased in          group III but showed a more regular gradual decrease in          group IV          When MAP levels between the groups were compared it          was observed that groups II and III had statistically          significant decreases compared to groups I and IV p            at  minutes Although MAP values decreased in          group IV there was an obvious difference

decreasing in groups          II III and IV They were clearly lower in those three          groups than in group I p   Table and Fig                                    Body temperature          In general there was no statistically significant          difference in body temperature between the study groups          but there was a significant difference between Group I          and the study groups p   In addition          hypothermia developed after endotoxin administration                          White blood cell count          There were fewer white blood cells in the study groups          than in the control group and the difference was          statistically significant p   There was no          significant difference in white blood cell counts between          the endotoxin and ibuprofentreated groups                          Platelet count          The number of platelets decreased after endotoxin          administration but ibuprofen had no effect on the          platelet counts                          Haematocrit levels          These began to decrease gradually after  min in          group II and after  min in group III when they were          significantly lower than the onset levels In group IV          there were no statistically significant changes in          haematocrit values throughout the study                          Plasma TxB levels          These increased following administration of endotoxin          at t            in Group II Significant decreases          in TxB            levels were detected in Group III          from  to  min after injection of ibuprofen at           min Highly significant differences were observed between          the t            and  min samples p                     In Group IV plasma TxB            levels were lowest between           minutes and t            there was no significant difference          between them Plasma TxB            levels began to increase after           minutes which was significantly different from the           minute and t            values p   and p            respectively          When plasma TxB            levels were compared between all          groups t

minutes plasma TxB            levels were reduced in both Groups          II and III but were increased in Group IV They were          significantly different between Groups II and III and the          control group but no significant differences were          detected between study groups p   Table and          Fig                           Urine PGE levels          These increased transiently after  minutes in Group          II and the increase at  min was significantly          different from the  min sample In Group III urine PGE                     levels were significantly increased          at  min compared with t            p   However they          declined after  minutes This decline continued to the           minute sample so that PGE            levels at both  and  min were          significantly lower than the  minute value p            but no different from t            p   In Group IV PGE            levels increased at  min compared          to t             after administration of endotoxin          They then began to decrease from  and  min but the          difference was only significant between  and  min p            Table and Fig                           Survival rates          Among the three endotoxic shock groups the longest          mean survival time was observed in Group IV             minutes The survival rate in Group IV was significantly          higher than in Group II    minutes but not          significantly higher than Group III             minutes p   In Group III mean survival time          was also significantly higher than in Group II p            Mean survival times are shown in Fig                             Discussion        Ibuprofen is a reversible shortacting cyclooxygenase        inhibitor which particularly blocks the synthesis of        thromboxane Under         in vitro conditions it has been        shown that ibuprofen stabilizes lyszomal membranes        restrains the secretion of lysozomal enzymes from        granulocytes and prevents the aggregation of platelets as        well as the immigration of leukocytes                NSAIDs were first used by Northover and Subramanian           in an endotoxic shock model in dogs in order to improve        hemodynamic disorders In endotoxic or septic shock models        respiration pathway changes occur in the lungs Metabolites        of cyclooxygenase play an important role in this Studies        done with ARDS patients have shown that there is an        increase in the number of PMNs in the lung and        broncoalveolar fluid which cause an increase in elastase        and other lysozomal enzymes     Kopolovic         et al    have reported that        respiration dysfunction and hypoxemia were improved and        pulmonary hypertension decreased in pigs that were        administered ibuprofen after         Pseudomonas aeruginosa infusion In        addition the same researchers reported that treatment with        ibuprofen caused a decrease in pulmonary shunt and lung        edema Balk         et al     used ibuprofen in a        canine endotoxic shock model and found that it affected the        extent of histological and morphometric lung injury        In this study the respiratory rates of the study groups        were significantly higher than the control group at  min        The respiration rates in both Groups III and IV were lower        than in Group II right out to  minutes Because the        study groups II III and IV showed no remarkable        differences after  min we presume that ibuprofen is not        effective after this time In addition ibuprofen        administration can prevent hyperpnoea if given before        endotoxin        Endotoxin administration may lead to hypotension and        tachycardia     In one study Suffredini         et al    administered endotoxin        to healthy volunteers and observed an increase in cardiac        output of  a decrease in systemic vascular pressure of         and an increase in heart rate of  Previously it        has been observed that ibuprofen administration in        endotoxic shock models prevents an increase in heart rate        due to metabolic changes or regulation of oxygen dispersal        at the tissue level      In addition another study        by Revhaug         et al    reported that ibuprofen        administration before endotoxin prevented an increase in        heart rate Yamanaka         et al    reported that there        were no significant differences from the heart rates of        controls in a similar study        In our study it was observed that pretreatment with        ibuprofen prevented heart rate increase The effects of        ibuprofen started at  min and lasted up to  min in the        group that received ibuprofen after endotoxin Thus it        appears that ibuprofen has no effect on secreted        cyclooxygenase products as it inhibits the cyclooxygenase        enzyme With this inhibition new production of        cyclooxygenase products is blocked Therefore the        cyclooxygenase secreted by Group III caused tachycardia        but new formation of cyclooxygenase was inhibited by        ibuprofen administration so tachycardia was resolved        Therefore it seems that ibuprofen administration has        little effect on respiratory rate and heart rate        Beck and Abel    reported that administration of        ibuprofen before endotoxin blocked the sudden drop in mean        arterial pressure in experimentallyinduced endotoxic shock        in dogs Coran         et al    reported that mean        arterial pressure was significantly higher in animals that        received ibuprofen before induced shock than the control        group in their experimental canine septic shock model They        indicated that MAP was consistently about  of the        initial arterial pressure level They also reported that        when animals received ibuprofen after endotoxin arterial        pressure initially fell to about  then increased        gradually and continued to be about  of initial        levels        In the present study there was a general reduction in        mean arterial blood pressure in group II which received        endotoxin On the other hand there was a sudden drop in        MAP in Group IV which received ibuprofen before endotoxin        whereas an increase in MAP was seen at  minutes in the        group that received ibuprofen after endotoxin However        since initial MAP levels were not established in the study        groups it is possible that some other mediators were        affecting blood pressure at the start of the        experiment        Ebong         et al    reported that all mice        developed hypothermia in their model where septic shock        was induced by caecal ligation While body temperature was        above C on day  it later decreased below C Haupt         et al    observed that fever in        severe septic shock patients was reduced after ibuprofen        administration However they did not see a reduction in        PGE          levels so they assumed that the        reduction in fever was due to ibuprofen causing a decrease        in IL and TNF secretion or due to the direct effect of        ibuprofen on the central nervous system The antipyretic        effect of ibuprofen started at  hours and lasted up to         hours after infusion        The role of cytokines in hypothermia is not yet known        however it is thought that the decrease in body        temperature is dependent on a decrease in pyrojenic        cytokines During hypothermic sepsis the response of        cytokines and eicosanoids is higher than in febrile        patients Therefore ibuprofen has been considered to be        more useful in hypothermic patients than in septic shock        patients     In our study changes in body temperature        among study groups were not statistically significant        The numbers of white blood cells are reduced in        experimental animals induced with endotoxic shock            Griffin         et al    reported that the number        of white blood cells decreased after endotoxin        administration in pigs In addition they found significant        differences between endotoxin and endotoxin plus ibuprofen        administration In our study groups the numbers of white        blood cells were significantly lower than in the controls        p   There were however no significant        differences in the white blood cell counts between        endotoxin and ibuprofen treated groups        Haematocrit values appear to increase in some endotoxic        shock models but decrease in others        It        has been reported that ibuprofen has no effect on the        consumption of systemic complement thrombocytopenia        leucocytosis or leucopenia     In our study there was        no increase in haematocrit levels This may be related to        the fact that  mL of blood was withdrawn from each        rabbit Ibuprofen also appeared to have no effect on        haematocrit levels in our study        The occurrence of isolated thrombocytopenia is higher        than  in septic shock patients without disseminated        intravascular coagulation     The endotoxic shock        experimentally induced by Griffin         et al    in pigs showed that the        numbers of platelets decreased after endotoxin        administration but no significant differences were again        seen between endotoxin and endotoxin plus ibuprofen p          In our study it was also observed that the number        of platelets decreased after endotoxin administration        whilst ibuprofen had no effect Many studies have shown        that endotoxin administration can result in an acute        decrease in the white blood cell count      but we        propose that ibuprofen has no effect on leukocyte and        platelet counts        It has been indicated that the pathway of cyclooxygenase        products such as TxB          and PGE           increases in many endotoxic shock        models and plays an important role in a number of        pathophysiological events             TxA          is a product of arachidonic acid and a        potent platelet aggregator whose levels increase during        endotoxic shock Ibuprofen prevents the formation of TxA           as well as platelet and leucocyte        aggregation      Fletcher         et al    reported that the        levels of TxB          were significantly reduced in rats by        a combination of TNF and ibuprofen Plasma TxB          levels were also reduced by        introducing ibuprofen into the faecal peritonitis rat model        used by Wise         et al            In this study TxB          levels decreased in the ibuprofen        posttreated group compared with initial onset levels In        addition it was found that the onset levels of TxB          were significantly lower in the        pretreated group than the other groups Making incisions        into the rabbits may have caused an increase in        proinflammatory cytokines Low levels of TxB          in group IV at  min were        probably a result of ibuprofen inhibiting the increase        which would normally be caused by these cytokines        The endotoxic shock mouse model reported by Rosello         et al    showed that the levels        of PGE          were significantly lower in the        ibuprofentreated group than in controls However the        levels of urine PGE          were higher at  hours in both        treated and untreated animals but the difference was not        statistically significant In our study it was observed        that urine PGE          gradually increased in group II after        endotoxin administration After treatment with ibuprofen        urine PGE          levels decreased over the next  min        but later began to rise again In another version of this        study published previously it was seen that ibuprofen        reduced the endothelin production induced by endotoxin        administration            Griffin         et al    reported that there was        no difference in mean survival times between control and        ibuprofen pre and posttreated groups Arons         et al    performed a study with        hypothermic septic patients and reported that ibuprofen        could be used to decrease mortality rates Schirmer         et al    found a transient        hour survival benefit in a rat model of septic shock        Fletcher         et al    also reported that        TNFinduced mortality could be reduced by using ibuprofen        Rosello         et al    found survival rates        increased in mice treated with ibuprofen In addition        Young and Passmore    reported that ibuprofentreated        canines with induced endotoxic shock had longer survival        times than those treated with propylgallate However        Bernard         et al    reported that there        were no statistically significant differences between        ibuprofentreated and untreated animals with regards to        their day survival rate        In our study mean survival time was significantly        longer in the ibuprofentreated groups compared with the        untreated group In addition the pretreated group had a        longer mean survival time than the posttreated group but        it was not statistically significant                    Conclusions        Ibuprofen appears to increase shortterm survival due to        its positive effect on various physiological parameters        Therefore the use of ibuprofen at higher doses over        longer time periods or in combination with other drugs in        patients who are at risk of developing septic shock could        be effective as a prophylaxis or treatment                    Competing Interests        This study was supported by Firat
