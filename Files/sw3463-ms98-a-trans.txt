                okay would you like to um begin or would you like me to start   uh oh i can start i i think one of the the biggest uh   okay   improvements in women is that finally youre starting to see them get into uh management   yes   and youre seeing them uh get uh elected to uh political offices uh not near enough i know theres still a long way to go especially in top management   hm umhum yes i agree   youre not seeing uh you know looking at TI you see them in management but youre not seeing them up there as VPs and i have a sister thats an attorney in Oklahoma City and i know the company that she was with   right   uh the women didnt have have near the positions the levels that the men attorneys had and were not uh given the same respect   right i agree with that i i think you do see more and more women out there in politics too as mayors or um you know in in helping to maybe um get some legislation passed to to have women have more rights i think still   yes   even with that whole um  thing with Judge Thomas and and um you you still felt like the woman was the one that you would maybe discredit first before the man or something the way they had it the trial and um  i just think that its its still gonna take another generation or so before  before the women   umhum umhum   really could really feel that theyre really equal in the business world or that they work just as hard or harder  um   right right   but its still um going from hm from homemakers into um corporate leaders is still a big step   right i also think that uh uh women as homemakers are beginning to get more respect than they used to be it used to be people would say do you work and youd say no i work in the home and it was it was then it was almost like a put down particularly particularly even by women in the work force   right   but i think now i think people are realizing that the roles women play in the home are very very important and its getting the respect and which is about time   yes   i think its true i think also people are having children at a older age so maybe like um you know you go through college and then you maybe work for a few years and then you have your first child   yes very definitely   and um you know you you know both sides of the coin   thats right   you know what its like and how much work it takes to keep the house running smoothly and to take care of the kids and  and then uh maybe people that are just working and think oh you just stay at home but then when theyre in their thirties and have their first and second kid its like       they lose it  they say wow this is harder than i thought well hm  you know   right yes and and and to those that have never worked worked and had you know and have stayed home with the kids kind of does your heart good  because i know i stayed home with mine and didnt start working until mine were in high school and uh   i know it  i know umhum   so you know it it kind of does me good i think also one of the things that thats really tremendous and it doesnt necessarily have to do with women but the fact that the fathers are so involved with families which again i think helps the womans role   are so involved yes right right their role has to change to kind of accommodate us too i know i have three children and my oldest is eleven and ive pretty much been home um since Brian was born   you know i umhum umhum   and um just recently i went back to work um last school semester to tutor um high school age students with learning disabilities and i was just out of the house two days a week   umhum   but i thought wow this is really hard only and it was only two days and i was home before three but getting the baby to day care getting the kids off to school i still did everything i always do       you know my husband still got up and went to work but um   uhhuh   it it only those two it made a big difference i thought wow a full time i dont think i could swing that   well i had to course i work full time but my daughter and her husband were out of town   personally   so i had my grandchildren for four days during uh football soccer season   oh oh boy   and so i would work and her friends some friends would take care of the kids but i would have to get them picked up from there get them fed get them to practices get homework done get baths i was absolutely exhausted and     picked up dinner right i bet i bet   and these women that are waiting until theyre in their late thirties or early forties to have their first children children i think are absolutely crazy   well i i know a lot of people i know i had my first child when i was twenty five and  thats not considered really young these days thats almost you know but um i have friends that that   umhum   have kids just starting kindergarten and theyre theyre forty years old and and then like maybe a two year old at home and i think boy i im im in my thirties
