                                 Beatty vs Buchanan                                             For David Plotzs Assessment of Warren Beatty click here                                       Third parties as the saying goes are like bees They sting and then theydie Independent presidential candidates succeed in America not by winningelections but by influencing the two major parties to adopt their positionsThus Teddy Roosevelt who lost the election of  as a Progressive wasnonetheless effective in the sense that both the Democrats and the Republicansborrowed his policies Another example of this phenomenon is George Wallaces presidential bid which encouraged the GOP to woo disenchanted Democratsin the South            Ross Perot conforms to this pattern as well His big issue in  was thebudget deficit By raising the topic relentlessly he encouraged Bill Clintonand George Bush to address it during the campaign The fact that Perot received percent of the vote was an inducement to Clinton to stick with deficitreduction once in office For this reason Perot deserves a share of the creditfor the healthy condition of the economy today            But Perot chose not to declare victory and go home In  he ran againthis time putting his opposition to freetrade agreements front and center Asa result of his strong performance in  he was eligible to receive million in public financing Perot did far less well the second time aroundgetting only  percent of the vote But that percentage still entitles theReform Party nominee to a federal subsidy of  million in the election            Its a huge pot of honey thats going to attract a lot of flies says RussVerney the outgoing national chairman and a close Perot ally Among thosebuzzing around recently have been political oddballs who seem to hail fromaltogether different planets Pat Buchanan Ralph Nader Donald Trump LowellWeicker and Warren Beatty            If none of them has yet taken the plunge it may be because theres a smallcatch to the cash namely the Reform Party itself which has come to resemblethe British Monster Raving Loony Party without the selfconscioustheatricality Reports from the Reform Partys recent convention in DearbornMich conveyed a fragrant whiff of Bedlam The partys delegates includedfollowers of the Marxist Lenora Fulani members of the rightwing PatriotParty notax libertarians and other miscellaneous extremists and wackosAccording to the Washington Post  the partys chairmanelect JackGargan is stockpiling weapons at his home in a remote part of the Florida Keysin anticipation of the global depression he thinks will result from a YKcatastrophe In short the Reform Party is both run and overrun by people whomake Ross Perot look sane and rational            As Verney says its unlikely that the  million will be left on thetable But in this unstable environment no one can predict whether that stakewill be used to whack the Democrats from the left or the Republicans from therightor to squeeze a Weickertype centrist into the narrow space between anAl Gore and a George W Bush For potential candidates the only vaguerequirements are a commitment to political reforms like term limits a beliefin fiscal discipline and skepticism about free trade Even these points may benegotiable            At last months convention in Dearborn Perot lost control of the party andthus the implied power to be or choose its nominee Gargan who encouragedPerot to enter the presidential race back in  and subsequently fell outwith him defeated Perots candidate Pat Benjamin to replace Verney as partychairperson            Gargan won with the endorsement of Minnesota Gov Jesse Ventura the ReformPartys only elected official and Perots rival as unofficial leader Venturasinterest is in keeping a seat warm until hes ready to run for presidenthimself To stand as an independent in  he needs to make sure the ReformParty gets at least  percent of the vote in  which would entitle it to apublic subsidy once again            Press reports have portrayed Gargan as the Bodys man But Micah Sifry whois writing a book on third parties tells me that Gargan isnt simply a Venturashill This means that while Perot probably wont be able to rig the results ofthe nominating process as he did against former Colorado Gov Richard Lamm lasttime around Ventura isnt automatically the kingmaker either Whats likely isa bitter battle between Perot and Ventura conducted through proxies theirrespective standins for the Reform Party presidential nominee            Perots favorite candidate at the moment appears to be Buchanan who hasmade noises about bolting the GOP and joining the Reform Party Buchanan wasthe hit of the United We Stand Convention in  and enjoys good relationswith Perot Buchanan also traveled to Minnesota in June to kiss Venturas ringThe two said nice things about each other after their session but Buchanandidnt win Venturas blessing Ventura is a libertarian on social issues Hesnot only strongly prochoice on abortion and sympathetic to drug legalizationbut has come out in favor of gay marriage which would seem to rule outBuchanan as his candidate He has since criticized Buchanan directly andencouraged Weicker to run for the Reform Partys nomination            Weicker has yet to declare his intentions In the meantime Ventura ispursuing the Bulworth option A source knowledgeable about the ReformParty tells me that media consultant Bill Hillsman who made Venturas cleverTV spots in  is meeting with Beatty this week on the West Coast Its asavvy choice of emissary Hillsman who made ads for Minnesota Democrat PaulWellstone before signing on with Ventura is even closer to Beattysliberalpopulist politics than Ventura is Hillsman couldnt be reached forcomment But Id wager hes telling Beatty about how the disaffected voters whoturned out to elect Ventura might be mobilized in a national campaign            If Perot successfully woos Buchanan and Ventura convinces Beatty to runnext years Reform Party nominating convention might be the most entertainingsideshow of the  campaign How do you describe the ideology of peopletrying to decide whether they want Pat Buchanan or Warren Beatty to bepresident Id call them mad as hellin more senses that one
