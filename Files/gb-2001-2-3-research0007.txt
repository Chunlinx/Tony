                    Background        Oxoglutarate OG and FeIIdependent dioxygenases        are widespread in eukaryotes and bacteria and catalyze a        variety of reactions typically involving the oxidation of        an organic substrate using a dioxygen molecule    One        wellstudied reaction catalyzed by such enzymes is the        hydroxylation of proline and lysine sidechains in collagen        and other animal glycoproteins     In plants        enzymes of this family catalyze the formation of the plant        hormone ethylene by oxidative desaturation of        aminocyclopropanecarboxylate and catalyze the        hydroxylation and desaturation steps in the synthesis of        other plant hormones pigments and metabolites such as        gibberellins anthocyanidins and flavones     In        bacteria and fungi several members of this family        participate in the desaturative cyclization and oxidative        ring expansion reactions in the biosynthesis of antibiotics        such as penicillin and cephalosporin     The        details of the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes have        been revealed by determination of the crystal structures of        isopenicillin N synthase IPNS deacetoxycephalosporin C        synthase DAOCS and clavaminic acid synthase CAS             These structures showed that the catalytic core of        the proteins consists of a doublestranded helix DSBH        fold containing a HX DE dyad where X is any amino acid        and a conserved carboxyterminal histidine which together        chelate a single iron atom The substrates are bound within        a spacious cavity formed by the interior of the DSBH see        the Structural Classification of Proteins SCOP                 We use sequence profile analysis    to show that        the DNArepair protein AlkB the extracellular matrix        protein leprecan and the diseaseresistancerelated protein        EGL define new families of the OGFeII dioxygenase        superfamily AlkB is widely represented in bacteria and        eukaryotes and has an important role in countering the        toxic DNA modifications caused by alkylating agents in both                Escherichia coli and         Homo sapiens     Despite        considerable effort the precise biochemical mechanisms of        its action in DNA repair remain unknown Recent studies        have shown that AlkB is required for specifically        processing lesions resulting from the alkylation of        singlestranded ss DNA   Our findings predict an        unusual role for this enzyme in oxidative detoxification of        DNA damage The EGL protein from         Caenorhabditis elegans is necessary        for normal muscle function and its inactivation results in        strong resistance to paralysis induced by the         Pseudomonas aeruginosa toxin          We predict that EGL is a novel hydroxylase that could        elicit its action through the modification of sidechains of        intracellular proteins Similarly we show that the animal        extracellular matrix protein leprecan   defines a        hitherto unknown family of protein hydroxylases that might        be involved in the generation of substrates for protein        glycosylation                    Results and discussion                  The OGFeII dioxygenase protein superfamily          classification and functional prediction          The Nonredundant Protein Sequence Database NCBI            was searched using the PSIBLAST program   run to          convergence with a profileinclusion threshold of           and AlkB protein sequences from various organisms as          queries In addition to the AlkB orthologs these          searches retrieved from the database with statistically          significant expectation e values several other more          distant homologs of AlkB including uncharacterized          eukaryotic proteins and fragments of the polyproteins of          plant RNA viruses from the caria tricho and potexvirus          families Examples of homologs found include           Leishmania L iteration           evalue                Drosophila CG iteration           evalue      papaya mosaic virus iteration           evalue      Further iterations of the search          using each of the detected proteins as a new query          resulted in the detection of several more eukaryotic          proteins including EGL and leprecan several          uncharacterized bacterial proteins and prolyl and lysyl          hydroxylases Finally another iteration of database          searches initiated with the sequences of bacterial          proteins typified by           E coli YbiX resulted in the          unification of these proteins with plant dioxygenases          such as leucoanthocyanidin oxidase and gibberellin          oxidase In this context it should be noted that the          DNArepair proteins typified by           E coli AlkB are unrelated to the          alkane omegahydroxylase typified by the           Ps oleovorans protein also named          AlkB Fortuitously these latter alkane hydroxylases are          also oxygenases however they are not OGFeII          dioxygenases but a distinct class of diiron enzymes            On the basis of the results of database searches          with representative sequences we delineated several          distinct families within the OGFeII dioxygenase fold          and constructed individual alignments for each using the          ClustalW program   Secondary structure was predicted          for each family using the PHD   and PSIPRED            programs Using the secondary structure elements from the          experimentally determined structures of IPNS PDBips          DAOCS PDBdcs CAS PDBdrt and the predicted          secondary structures for individual families the          conserved core of these elements was delineated Figure           A multiple alignment for the entire superfamily was          constructed by aligning the conserved sequence features          shared by all the individual families The boundaries of          the secondary structure elements in the alignment were          adjusted using the secondary structure conservation as a          guide          The conserved portion of the OGFeII dioxygenase          superfamily proteins comprises the core DSBH domain seen          in the IPNS DAOCS and CAS structures     and          part of the aminoterminal  helix that showed          considerable variability in both length and sequence          between individual families Figures   The DSBH          region includes seven conserved strands that are common          to all these proteins and are arranged in two sheets in a          jellyroll topology Figures   However different          families have specific inserts in various positions          between the conserved strands some of these inserts          contain additional secondary structures and show          significant sequence conservation Figures   For          example the insert between the fifth and sixth strand in          AlkB is predicted to contain an extra strand whereas in          the smallmolecule dioxygenase IPNSethyleneforming          enzyme EFE family the same region forms or is          predicted to form a short helix Figures   The          clavaminic acid synthase an outlier of this latter          family has its own characteristic inserts including a          giant approximately  amino acids insert between          strands  and    and some members of the AlkB family          have smaller inserts in the same position Figure           This reflects the relative resilience of the core DSBH to          insertions and accounts for difficulties in unification          of this superfamilyby sequencebased methods The          multiple alignment contains at least three characteristic          conserved motifs that center respectively at a HXD dyad          near the amino terminus a histidine towards the carboxyl          terminus and an arginine or lysine further downstream          Figure  The HXD dyad is located in a flexible loop          that follows the first conserved strand and stacks with          the sheet containing three of the core strands Figures            The second conserved histidine is associated with          the beginning of the sixth strand whereas the conserved          basic residue R or K is in the beginning of the seventh          strand of the DSBH core Figures   The sixth          position after the conserved basic residue is invariably          occupied by a bulky residue that is either arginine in          AlkB or phenylalanine or tryptophan in all other members          of this fold     Figure           The roles of all these conserved residues in catalysis          are apparent from the crystal structures of IPNS          clavaminic acid synthase CAS and deacetoxycephalosporin          C synthase DAOCS     The conserved HXD and the          carboxyterminal histidine coordinate FeII that is          directly involved in catalysis by these enzymes Figure           The conserved basic residue interacts with the          carboxylate group of the acidic substrate while the          bulky or aromatic residue located carboxyterminal to the          basic one forms the base of the cleft that holds this          substrate molecule Figure  Whereas most of these          enzymes necessarily use OG as the acidic substrate          IPNS does not bind OG Its place is occupied by its          single substrate          LaminoadipoylLcysteinylDvaline whose carboxyl          sidechain interacts with the conserved basic residue          similarly to the OGcarboxylate in the other enzymes of          this superfamily             The conservation of all the residues implicated in          catalysis in the biochemically uncharacterized proteins          such as AlkB EGL leprecan and YbiX suggests they all          catalyze oxidative reactions similar to those catalyzed          by IPNS DAOCS CAS and related enzymes such as protein          lysylprolyl hydroxylases EFE and leucoanthocyanidin          oxidases    Using the available contextual          information we attempted to predict possible substrates          of these proteins AlkB binds ssDNA and is required for          the processing of toxic DNA modifications caused by SN          alkylating agents such as methylmethanesulfonate MMS          specifically on ssDNA On the basis of the preferential          specificity of AlkBdependent repair for ssDNA and for          SN as opposed to SN alkylating agents it has been          proposed that its targets include modified bases such as          N methyladenine and N methylcytosine   The          predicted OGFeII dioxygenase activity of AlkB is          probably involved in the detoxification of methylated          bases in ssDNA possibly through hydroxylation of the          methyl groups resulting in less toxic base derivatives          The hydroxylation might be followed by a second oxidative          step that could remove the hydroxymethyl group restoring          the normal base in DNA These reactions are consistent          with the observation that unlike AlkA AlkB has no DNA          glycosylase activity   The most intriguing finding          made during our analysis of the AlkB family is the          existence of multiple eukaryotic AlkB homologs other          than the actual orthologs especially in plants and their          viruses The specific action of AlkB on ssDNA suggests          that ssRNA could be the substrate for other members of          this family Given the presence of RNA methylases that          could modify RNA in a similar way as the alkylating          agents the function of the uncharacterized AlkBlike          proteins could be to reverse such modifications Such          modifications might also be used in the hostmediated          inactivation of viral RNAs and the AlkB homologs          acquired by some plant viruses could counter this          hostdefense mechanism The connection between nucleic          acid methylation and the AlkB homologs described here is          supported by the domain architecture of a conserved pair          of animal proteins CB from           C elegans and CG from           Drosophila  in which an          aminoterminal AlkBlike domain is fused to a          carboxyterminal predicted methyltransferase domain          These proteins could potentially be involved in          regulation of RNA stability or DNA repair via controlled          methylationdemethylation          EGL defines a new family within the OGFeII          dioxygenase superfamily that is highly conserved in          animals and is also represented in the pathogenic          proteobacteria such as           Ps aeruginosa and           Vibrio cholerae In           C elegans EGL is required for          normal egg laying whereas loss of its function provides          resistance to hypercontractile muscular paralysis caused          by           Ps aeruginosa   The          vertebrate homolog of EGL is specifically expressed in          smooth muscles and is likely to have a role in their          function   At its carboxyl terminus EGL contains          a MYND finger domain that is probably involved in          specific proteinprotein interactions   The closest          relatives of the EGL family are the proline          hydroxylases with which they share a region of specific          extended conservation amino terminal to the core DSBH          domain Figure  This relationship along with the          combination to the intracellular MYND domain and the lack          of signal peptides suggests that the Egl family          proteins are prolyl hydroxylases that modify          intracellular proteins unlike the classic prolyl          hydroxylases that have been implicated primarily in the          modification of collagens in the endoplasmic lumen The          interesting aspect of the EGL family is its presence in                    V cholerae and           Ps aeruginosa Figure  which          have apparently acquired these genes by horizontal          transfer from eukaryotes The direct connection between          this gene acquisition and the action of the           Ps aeruginosa toxins on animal          muscles is unclear but it seems possible that the          bacterial EGLlike proteins modify host proteins in a          manner that favors the survival and spread of the          pathogen This might be especially pertinent if the host          downregulates the endogenous ortholog in response to the          infection          Leprecan is a proteoglycan that is associated with the          basement membrane in chordates   It and related          proteins contain an aminoterminal segment rich in          leucine and proline   and a carboxyterminal globular          part that includes the OGFeII oxygenase domain More          distant relatives of the leprecanlike proteins include          the TK protein from           Arabidopsis and a family of          uncharacterized proteobacterial proteins typified by YbiX          Figure  These proteins are predicted to be previously          unnoticed aminoacid hydroxylases that catalyze          modifications of intracellular and extracellular          proteins                          Evolutionary implications          Sequence conservation is high within individual          families of the OGFeII dioxygenase superfamily with          specific extensions typical of each family but low          between different families Figure  This observation          together with the phyletic distribution of these          proteins provides some clues to their evolutionary          history Members of this superfamily could not be          detected in the Archaea despite extensive profile          searches of the archaeal proteomes as well as transitive          searches seeded with many divergent sequences as starting          points This suggests that unlike bacteria and          eukaryotes in which the superfamily is widely          represented archaea do not encode           bona fide members A corollary of          this is that horizontal gene transfer between bacteria          and eukaryotes might have had a significant role in the          evolution of this superfamily The DSBH fold that          comprises the core domain of the OGFeII dioxygenases          is also present in a large number of proteins typified by          the arabinosebinding domain of the transcription          regulator AraC plant seed proteins such as vicilin and          oxalate oxidase   see SCOP   Despite the lack          of detectable sequence similarity to OGFeII          dioxygenases these proteins contain a conserved HXH          motif and a carboxyterminal histidine that appear to be          equivalent to the metalchelating HXD and          carboxyterminal histidine of the latter see above          Thus these two protein superfamilies could have evolved          from a common ancestor by acquiring distinct catalytic          and ligandbinding properties The classic AraClike DSBH          proteins appear to have a more universal distribution          than the OGFeII dioxygenases with diverse forms          represented in archaea bacteria and eukaryotes The          OGFeII dioxygenase superfamily is present in diverse          bacteria that had probably diverged before the          diversification of the eukaryotes that contain this          superfamily This together with the phyletic          distributution of the AraC and OGFeII dioxygenase          superfamilies leads us to speculate that the OGFeII          dioxygenase superfamily evolved from the AraClike          superfamily in bacteria through drastic sequence          divergence that eliminated significant sequence          similarity followed by fixation of the modified          activesite configuration          In the case of the AlkB family a single horizontal          transfer event probably resulted in their entry into the          eukaryotic lineage which was followed by adaptation to          new RNArelated roles by some paralogs In the case of          the smallmolecule dioxygenase IPNSEFE family a          complex web of relationships can be discerned The EFE          and the plant secondary metabolite biosynthesis enzymes          flavonol synthase leucoanthocyanidin hydroxylase and          giberellin oxidase show maximum diversify in the plant          lineage     Their close homologs are however          also found in           Pseudomonas but not in other          wellstudied proteobacterial lineages Similarly fungi          contain several enzymes involved in secondary metabolite          biosynthesis such as IPNS and DAOCS that are distinctly          related to their counterparts in actinomycetes This          patchy phyletic distribution across kingdoms is          suggestive of multiple gene transfer events that have          apparently led to the wide dissemination of these          proteins in bacteria and eukaryotes The close grouping          of the ethyleneforming enzyme and its           Pseudomonas homologs   to the          exclusion of other members of this family in plants          indicates a possible recent acquisition of the gene in           Pseudomonas from its plant hosts          In           Arabidopsis there is an expansion          of smallmolecule dioxygenases at least  members          whereas           Ps aeruginosa has at least three          recently duplicated members This proliferation of the          smallmolecule dioxygenases is consistent with their          possible role in the synthesis of secondary metabolites          in these organisms      The aminoacid          hydroxylases show the greatest diversify in eukaryotes          and are represented in a number of different forms in          both animals and plants They were probably derived from          smallmolecule hydroxylases early in eukaryotic          evolution In contrast the predicted aminoacid          hydroxylases of the EGL family are seen sporadically          in single copies in certain bacterial lineages such as           V cholerae and           Ps aeruginosa suggesting a          secondary horizontal transfer from the eukaryotes to          bacteria                            Conclusions        Before this study structure determination biochemical        studies and sequence comparisons of OGFeII dioxygenases           had elucidated their structural fold activesite        residues and reaction mechanism Here using sequence        profile searches we show that many other protein families        contain the same constellation of activesite residues and        are predicted to adopt the same fold This allows us to        predict the catalytic activity of a wide range of        functionally important but biochemically uncharacterized        proteins from eukaryotes and bacteria In particular we        propose a specific mechanism of action in DNA repair and        possibly in RNA modification for the AlkB protein and its        homologs                    Materials and methods        The Nonredundant Protein Sequence Database   the        Expressed Sequence Tags Database NCBI   and the        individual protein sequence databases of completely and        partially sequenced genomes   were searched using the        gapped version of the BLAST programs BLASTPGP for proteins        and TBLASTNGP for translating searches of nucleotide        databases   Sequence profile searches were performed        using the PSIBLAST program   profiles were saved        using the C option and retrieved using the R option        Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences were generated        using a combination of PSIBLAST CLUSTALW   and        secondary structure predictions that were produced using        the PHD program   and the PSIPRED program   with        multiple alignments of individual protein families used as        queries The threedimensional structure visualization        alignment and modeling were carried out using the        SWISSPDBViewer program
