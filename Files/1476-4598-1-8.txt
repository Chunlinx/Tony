                    Background        Promoter methylation has been well recognized as an        important epigenetic change in the development of cancer            Normally CpG islands in the promoter regions of a        number of genes are present in an unmethylated state            Aberrant methylation of CpG islands in promoters is        characteristic of several genes in cancer leading to loss        of gene expression A nonrandom pattern of promoter        hypermethylation has been noted in specific genes in        specific tumor types although some genes are commonly        methylated in diverse tumors      The extent of        aberrant promoter hypermethylation and its association with        loss of gene function in cancer suggests that CpG island        methylation is an important mechanism in inactivating tumor        suppressor genes TSGs        Germ cell tumors GCTs are the most common cancer in        men between the ages  with an incidence of  cases        per      GCTs arise by transformation of        spermatogonial lineage cells and display pluripotentiality        for embryonal and extraembryonal lineage differentiation            Histologically they may present as undifferentiated        germ cell GClike seminomas SGCTs or highly        differentiated nonseminomas NSGCTs NSGCTs display        complex differentiation patterns that include embryonal        extraembryonal and somatic tissue types     Teratomas        with somatic differentiation can undergo additional        malignant transformation with characteristics of        epithelial mesenchymal neurogenic or hematologic tumors            While the majority of GCTs exhibit exquisite        sensitivity to cisplatinbased chemotherapy a small        proportion of metastatic tumors remain resistant        Therefore male GCTs comprise a unique model system to        investigate the biology and genetics of GC transformation        differentiation and chemotherapy resistancesensitivity                   During the life span of a normal GC extensive        methylation reprogramming occurs     However the role        of epigenetic changes in GCT etiology and biology are not        well studied To investigate such a role we evaluated the        status of promoter hypermethylation of  genes in GCT        specimens and cell lines We found an absence of promoter        hypermethylation in SGCT and acquisition of unique patterns        of promoter hypermethylation in NSGCT We also showed that        the hypermethylation leads to loss of expression in most of        the genes and reactivate upon treatment with demethylating        drug Aza deoxycytidine                    Results                  Promoter hypermethylation is common in NSGCT and          rare in SGCT          We assessed  GCT DNAs representing all histologic          subsets of NSGCT and SGCT and four normal testes for          methylation status of CpG islands of  gene promoters by          methylationspecific PCR MSP Fig  Of these           genes            MGMT            RASSFA            APC            RARB            CDH            MLH            TIMP            GSTP

tumor types              Six additional genes            RB            NME            NME            BTG            NEDD  and           APAF  were studied because of          their possible involvement in genetic alterations in GCT          as indicated by LOH studies       The           RB gene at q showed frequent          loss of heterozygosity LOH in GCT     The           NME and           NME genes mapped to q also          were affected by LOH and exhibited loss of expression in          teratoma     The           BTG            APAF  and           NEDD genes mapped to the q          commondeletion region and thus considered as candidate          TSGs in GCT                Promoter hypermethylation was not found in normal          testes for any of the tested genes except           CDH            CDH exhibited methylation in two          of the four normal testes analyzed However promoter          hypermethylation was detected in  of the            GCTs studied with an individual gene frequency of           RASSFA             MGMT             BRCA             HIC             APC             RARB             CDH             FHIT             MLH             TIMP             GSTP   and           NME   Fig  The remaining          nine genes did not show methylation Hypermethylation of          one or more genes was found only in  of   SGCTs          but in  of   NSGCTs Fig  Four of the five          SGCTs that exhibited promoter hypermethylation were          methylated at a single locus and one tumor at two loci          whereas  of the  NSGCTs exhibited two or more          methylated loci Promoter hypermethylation was seen in          all histologic subsets of NSGCT with yolk sac tumor          YST exhibiting a higher frequency of methylation          compared to other histologies Fig  Fig                           Relationship between promoter hypermethylation and          gene expression          To examine the biological role of promoter          hypermethylation in GCT we assessed the levels of gene          expression by semiquantitative RTPCR in  tumors           NSGCTs and  SGCTs with known methylation status Eight          genes            MGMT            RASSFA            BRCA            APC            RARB            CDH            MLH  and           TIMP  that exhibited methylation          in  of the cases were examined Fig  Table           Levels of expression of each gene were assessed by          comparing with the respective control values obtained          from the averages calculated from  to  normal testes          after normalization against           ACTB  All tumors with promoter          hypermethylation of the           MGMT and           MLH genes exhibited an absence or          downregulated expression of the respective gene while           of  cases with           RASSFA methylation and  of           tumors with           RARB methylation showed          downregulated expression Table  The other four genes                     BRCA            APC            CDH  and           TIMP  did not show a consistent          pattern of correlation between methylation and loss of          gene expression Table  Of note the           MGMT gene exhibited downregulated          expression in  of the   tumors including all          the tumors that showed promoter methylation No          consistent downregulation of expression of the other          genes that lacked promoter methylation was detected in          the same panel of specimens These data thus showed          loss of           MGMT expression in majority of GCTs          of all histologic subsets                          Demethylation reactivates the gene          expression          To further examine the role of promoter methylation in          gene inactivation we treated five NSGCT cell lines          ER KE Tera Tera and A with Aza          deoxycytidine and analyzed the expression of           MGMT            RASSFA            RARB  and           BRCA genes The           MGMT gene exhibited promoter          hypermethylation in four of the cell lines which upon          treatment with Aza deoxycytidine showed reactivation          of expression in three ER KE and Tera The          cell line Tera did not reactivate expression after          azacytidine treatment Fig  One cell line TA          showed no promoter hypermethylation of           MGMT by MSP and no detectable          levels of mRNA expression by RTPCR but expression was          reactivated after Aza deoxycytidine treatment Two          of the five cell lines showed methylation in the           RARB gene one of which Tera          showed detectable levels of gene expression in untreated          cells Fig  The other four cell lines including the          one with promoter hypermethylation ER exhibited no          detectable levels of           RARB expression Azacytidine          treatment activated gene expression in all the five cell          lines whether or not promoter had detectable methylation          Fig  The           RASSFA gene was methylated in  of          the  cell lines studied While one of the methylated          cell lines showed expression in untreated cells all          other cell lines did not show detectable levels of mRNA          Azacytidine treatment reactivated expression of           RASSFA in one of each of the two          methylated and two unmethylated cell lines The           BRCA gene showed promoter          methylation in  of  cell lines Irrespective of whether          the promoter is methylated or not the           BRCA gene was expressed in all          cell lines and the treatment of azacytidine had little or          no effect on levels of gene expression Fig                             Discussion        Epigenetic mechanisms of gene silencing are increasingly        being recognized to affect a number of molecular pathways        in human cancer     The extent and the nature of such        epigenetic modifications in GCTs are currently poorly        understood Here we show that hypermethylation is common in        NSGCT and rare in SGCT Several studies have shown that        both NSGCTs and SGCTs exhibit similar genetic alterations        including isochromosome for the short arm of chromosome         ip     Thus epigenetic alterations such as those        detected in the current study is one distinct molecular        change that distinguishes these two histologic subsets The        rare CpG hypermethylation seen in five SGCT patients may be        due to the existence of a minor NSGCT component that might        have escaped the histologic diagnosis A unique feature of        GCTs is their origin from germ cells at a stage in        development where they undergo epigenetic reprogramming             The absence of this epigenetic modification in SGCTs        is consistent with their GClike nature as previously noted             On the other hand the extensive promoter        hypermethylation seen in NSGCTs suggests a mechanistic role        in their potential for embryonal and extraembryonal        lineage differentiation      Establishment of DNA        methylation in the mammalian genome is controlled by at        least three DNA methyltransferases DNMTs         DNMT          DNMTa and         DNMTb     The role of these        DNMTs in differential de novo methylation in SGCT vs NSGCT        remains to be elucidated        The overall higher frequency of promoter methylation        seen in NSGCTs is noticeably evident in DNA repair genes         RASSFA BRCA  and         MGMT  and the hypermethylated in        cancer           HIC  gene which encodes a        transcription factor These genes map to sites already        known to be genetically altered in GCT specimens The        p region to which         RASSFA maps undergoes deletions in        many solid tumor types including GCTs             RASSFA encodes a splice variant of        human RAS effector homologue which interacts with the XPA        protein and functions as a negative regulator of cell        growth              RASSFA has been shown to be        inactivated by promoter methylation in a variety of tumor        types        The q and p regions to        which         BRCA and         HIC map respectively also have        been characterized by high frequency of LOH in GCT            The         BRCA  gene plays critical roles in        DNA repair and recombination cell cycle checkpoint        control and transcription and has been shown to be        hypermethylated in breastovarian cancer     The         HIC gene is also often        hypermethylated in many human cancers       The        DNA repair gene         MGMT encodes OmethylguanineDNA        methyltransferase and this enzyme effectively removes DNA        adducts formed by alkylating agents     Epigenetic        inactivation of the         MGMT gene was reported in a wide        variety of cancers      Also a low frequency of        methylation of the         APC          RARB  and         FHIT genes was detected in NSGCTs        Thus the frequent hypermethylation in the         MGMT BRCA  and         RASSFA  and         HIC define the methylation profile        in NSGCT These data suggest that promoter hypermethylation        leading to gene silencing may affect key pathways in germ        cell tumorigenesis        Aberrant promoter methylation changes that occur in        cancer are associated with transcriptional repression and        loss of function of the gene by interrupting the binding of        proteins involved in transcription activator complex            Our gene expression analysis by RTPCR demonstrated that        all tumors that showed methylation of         MGMT and         MLH also showed downregulated        expression while         RASSFA and         RARB genes showed downregulation of        mRNA levels in most of the methylated tumors Thus in these        cases promoter hypermethylation is one mechanism whereby        gene expression can be deregulated in GCTs On the other        hand methylation of         BRCA          APC          CDH  and         TIMP genes did not correlate with        expression levels Interestingly         MGMT gene was also down regulated in         of the  tumors that did not exhibit methylation by MSP        analysis Therefore these data indicate that other        epigenetic andor genetic changes may be involved in        regulating the expression of         MGMT in GCT The MSP method detects        only methylation of fulllength CpG islands and cannot        identify partial methylation of the promoters Thus role        of partial methylation in downregulating         MGMT cannot be ruled out Other        epigenetic mechanisms involving defects in chromatin        modification factors such as the association of methylCpG        binding proteins acetylation and methylation of histone        proteins are also becoming known     The role of these        chromatinmediated components in inactivating the         MGMT gene remains to be examined in        GCT To determine whether the downregulated expression of        the         MGMT gene is due to genetic        mutations we examined the entire coding region in  GCTs        and found no inactivating mutations unpublished        observations        Epigenetic gene silencing of the         MGMT confers enhanced sensitivity to        alkylating agents in cancer      Lack of        methylation on the other hand associates with highrisk        of death      It has been suggested that the        highlevels of         MGMT proteins contribute to a        drugresistant phenotype     More than  of newly        diagnosed GCTs and  of patients who present        metastatic disease are cured with cisplatinbased        chemotherapy     However  of the patients with        metastatic disease exhibit resistance to the cisplatin        curative regimen leading to high mortality in this group        The molecular basis of this exquisite chemotherapy        sensitivity of GCT and resistance is poorly understood We        have previously shown that subsets of resistant tumors        exhibit         TP gene mutations and chromosomal        amplifications     However the role of         MGMT in GCT sensitivity or resistance        to chemotherapy is not known Our current observation that        undetectable levels of         MGMT gene expression in  of        GCTs appears to suggest that the lack of the        OmethylguanineDNA methyltransferase enzyme may direct        cells to undergo apoptosis due to failure of repair of DNA        adducts formed by alkylating agents Lack of         MGMT expression in the majority of        GCTs suggests a potential role for this protein in lack of        repair of cisplatininduced DNA damage that may result in        exquisite sensitivity in this tumor It has been shown that        engineered overexpression of wildtype p         in vitro causes inhibition of         MGMT transcription in human tumor        cells     Abundant overexpression of wildtype p        owing to their stage of origin is a characteristic feature        of GCTs     A possibility also exists that the         MGMT expression may in general be        down regulated in tumors arising from embryonictype cells        To examine this we analyzed  cases of Wilms tumor but        found no decreased levels of the         MGMT gene expression data not        shown These data therefore rule out the possibility        that not all tumors arising from embryonictype cells show        downregulated expression of         MGMT         Transcriptional silencing of genes resulting from DNA        hypermethylation of CpG islands is reversed by treatment of        the hypomethylating agent azadeoxycytidine in a dose        and durationdependent manner Since a number of gene        promoters were hypermethylated and showed downregulated        mRNA in GCT we wanted to test whether hypomethylation        reactivates the gene expression in these tumors We found        that azacytidine treatment resulted in reactivation of gene        expression in almost all cell lines that showed promoter        methylation of         MGMT RASSFA and         RARB genes with the exception of the        cell line Tera In addition a number of genes that        showed no evidence of fulllength CpG methylation was also        reactivated upon azacytidine treatment This was most        evident for the         RARB gene where all five cell lines        showed reactivation whether or not the promoter was        methylated These data thus suggest that global        demethylation may not only influence the expression of        methylated genes but also unmethylated genes Such a        phenomenon has previously been reported                         Conclusions        The data presented here show that promoter        hypermethylation is an important molecular signature        differentiating seminomatous and nonseminomatous GCTs        Promoter methylation was frequently seen in DNA repair        genes         MGMT          RASSFA  and         BRCA  and a transcriptional        repressor gene         HIC  Promoter methylation of most        genes resulted in transcriptional repression The data also        suggest that multiple mechanisms in addition to the        promoter methylation may play a role in silencing of         MGMT gene expression in GCTs of all        histologic subsets Given the importance of the MGMT        protein in treatment response to alkylating agents this        molecular switch may play a critical role in sensitivity to        cisplatinbased therapy in GCTs Demethylation of the        promoters reactivated the gene expression in         MGMT          RARB and         RASSFA genes Further        characterization of the exact mechanisms involved in        epigenetic gene silencing especially in the         MGMT gene may provide important        clues in understanding the pathways relevant to
