                                 George Ws Wimp Factor            In over the protests of outraged liberals Arkansas Gov Bill Clinton flewhome in the midst of his presidential campaign to supervise the execution of aretarded killer The message to voters was that Clinton unlike previousDemocratic presidential candidates was tough on crime Last week after agunman murdered seven people in a Fort Worth church Texas Gov George W Bushflew home to urge Americans to pray for love in peoples hearts The messagethis time is that Bush unlike previous Republican presidential candidates iscompassionate            IfBush succeeds in projecting such sensitivity the cure may prove worse than thedisease Republicans used to win elections by calling their Democraticopponents soft on crime Clinton first as a candidate and then as presidentfrustrated this tactic by recasting gun controlpreviously an issue of biggovernmentas an issue of getting tough on thugs Bush who opposes mostfederal gun control proposals and signed the law that lets Texans carryconcealed handguns is in danger of completing this reversal By fighting crimewith love he is coming across not as a gun nut but as a wimp            Bushtried to send two messages in response to the Texas shooting The first isthat as conservatives have traditionally argued cultureparticularlyreligionis more important than government In remarks replayed endlessly ontelevision and in the print media Bush blamed the shooting on a wave ofevil The killer he surmised was acting as a result of evil in his heartAnd I would hope that America would collectively pray for love in peopleshearts Rather than discuss gun control or prosecution Bushs campaign Website offered visitors a single quote atop his home page This is a terribletragedy made worse by the fact it took place in a house of hope and love Mythoughts and prayers are with the victims their families and thecongregation            Second Bush tried to project a virtue traditionally scorned by conservativescompassion Its inexplicable to me how somebodys heart could be so full ofhate that he would walk into a place of worship where youngsters were seekingGods grace and love and kill people Bush told the media Rushing home toadd some comfort to the pain and sorrow Bush regretted that theres notmuch to say and that all I could do  was embrace the victims and theirfamilies Its hard to do anything but just to say I love you  helamented Rather than dismiss the shooter as a coldblooded killer Bush calledhim a sick person who must be demented            Thesecond message has curdled the first Swaddled in hugs empathy and spiritualmusings on the gunmans heart Bushs appeal to cultural renewal instead ofgovernment intervention comes across more as a plea for love instead of lawsWe as a society can pass laws and hold people accountable he told reportersBut our hopes and prayers have got to be that there is more love in societyI wish I knew the law to make people love one another Bush added We canpass laws but there needs to be a higher law And that is Love your neighborlike youd like to be loved yourself             Bushisnt the only conservative projecting such an oddly mixed message Mostpeople are going to understand what a terribly terribly tragic thing this iswhat a horrible tormented person this is lamented House Majority Leader DickArmey RTexas Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer blaming themassacre on societal elements that create such empty hearts that commit thesecrimes adopted the leftist pose of victimhood calling for a federal study ofcrimes against men and women of faith            WhileVice President Al Gore professes reluctance to politicize the tragedy hisallies at the Democratic National Committee have seized the opportunity tolabel Bush soft on crime In  Bush went out of his way to make it harderto prosecute gunmen carrying deadly weapons into churches and school eventsthe DNC charged You cant say you support law enforcement and then refuse tosupport law enforcements attempts to close the gun show loophole Its timefor Bush to start listening to law enforcement and stop listening to theNRA            Guncontrol activists have gone further Speaking on television and in the printmedia about the Texas massacre they juxtapose todays weak gun laws with thetough restrictions they would prefer They claim the support of police andthe enmity of criminals Mocking Bushs plea that he didnt know agovernmental law that will put love in peoples hearts Handgun ControlChairwoman Sarah Brady blasted the cowardice of elected officials who blameeverything for the carnageexcept for the guns Texas she pointedlysuggested must contemplate what its lax gun laws and liberal gun culture havecreated            Themedia seem to be having fun with the notion of Bush as a liberal The LosAngeles Times reported that after the shooting Bush again ruled out theneed for stronger gun controls In Texas Bush has liberalized gun laws TheNew York Times cited speculation that Bush was concerned about renewedcharges by many Democrats that he was soft on guns On CNNs CapitalGang  Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal cracked that Bush was alittle bit Clintonian flying back from Michigan to feel the pain USNews  World Report concluded that while Bush was concentrating onlove Al Gore was concentrating on laws            Tuesday Bush tried to steer his campaign back to the right Flanked by Texasattorney general and the states leading prosecutors he unveiled a plan tohire extra prosecutors who would focus exclusively on gun crimes Scarcely asentence passed his lips without a mention of toughness The best way toprotect our citizens is to vigorously enforce the tough laws we have on thebooks Bush declared We have some very tough laws against gun violence inTexas and federal law with its mandatory sentences is tough as well  Onlywith tough enforcement can we win the war against gun violence            ManyRepublicans thought Bushs dad lost in  because he was out of touch Theythought Bob Dole lost in  because he was mean and distant This time theywere looking for a candidate who knew how to speak the language of love Nexttime they may be looking for a candidate who knows when to stop            Frame Game has alsoscrutinized     and who have hounded George W Bush
