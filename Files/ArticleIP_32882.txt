                                 CREEP Show            The delightful comedyDick defaces the memory of Americas most cherished political scandalIts a mustache on the Mona Lisaor maybe a big crooked dick on the cover ofAll the Presidents                Men  Simply put the movie makes the charmingcase that Deep Throat Bob Woodwards pseudonymous highlevel source was notas recent Chatterbox columns have speculated an FBI honcho such as W MarkFelt but two bubbleheaded yearold blondes            According to the filmArlene Michelle Williams lived at the Watergate Hotel and she and BetsyKirsten Dunst were the ones who put the duct tape on the stairway lock thatled security guards to the burglars The girls were slipping out to mail theirentry to a Win a Date With Bobby Sherman contest To keep Betsy and Arlenequiet about having seen G Gordon Liddy Harry Shearer at both the Watergateand the White House Nixon Dan Hedaya made them Official White House DogWalkersin which capacity they stumbled on a room full of people shreddingdocuments and counting piles of payoff money As Dick tells it thestory got even weirder Here at last is the druggy truth behind dtente Andyou wont believe what was really on those  minutes of erased OvalOffice tape            The amazing thing about Dick directed by AndrewFleming from a script he wrote with Sheryl Longin is that it manages toburlesque the Watergate mythos without trivializing it Under its slapstickshenanigans this modest movie offers a convincing vision of Nixon White Houseoperations as a sordid buffoon show undone by a couple of painfully earnestinnocents Its natures revenge on the overweening The larger truths are allthere and some of the smaller ones toolike the idea that Nixons paranoiawould extend even to his dog another Checkers or that Woodward and Bernsteinmight seem as vain and as clumsily ambitious as the felons theyre pursuingPostMonica Lewinsky it isnt odd to think of wideeyed airheads wandering theWhite House PostMonica Crowley it isnt even odd to think of wideeyedairheads drinking in the wisdom of Richard Nixon Its blissfully satisfyingto hear Arlenewho has replaced her Bobby Sherman posters with those of herDick and who fantasizes about romping on a beach with him in slow motioncometo her senses and utter the immortal reproach You kicked Checkers and youreprejudiced and you have a potty mouth            Some critics havecompared Dick to Alexander Paynes great Election  towhich it bears not the faintest resemblance Payne employs multiple points ofview probes his characters psyches and edits with a snap By contrastDick is rather limp The pacing is purposefully slackthe gags justdribble out Flemings poker face is perfect for making you giggle at offhandinsertions of Watergate minutiae or urbanparanoid compositions cribbed fromAlan J Pakulas film of All the Presidents Men  The moviessophistication hits you gradually Maybe you have to be sophisticated to make apicture so effortlessly cheerfully facile about a subject so dark andconvoluted Dunst and Williams make Betsy and Arlene simple in ways that gobeyond dumb so that their budding awareness of Dicks mendacity has anunexpected emotional kick Like many Americans of that era theyre crushedthey get their own back and then they leap into the age of rollerdisco TheBogey Man goes down and Dick sends you home boogeying            M ystery Men is one of those halfstraighthalfspoof comicbook extravaganzas that dont ever work and whats neat isthat this one doesbeautifully The movie based on the FlamingCarrotMysterymen comics unfolds in a dirigiblefilled urban metropolis inwhich superheroes routinely mix it up with supervillains and in which thereexists an entire class of nerdy superhero wannabes each of whom struggles toconcoct a persona that will fully embody what he or she does most superheroically The protagonist Roy Ben Stiller calls himself Mr Furiousbecause his anger supposedly gives him powers undreamt of by mere mortals Heglowers and snorts like the Incredible HulkI am a ticking timebombexcept that he doesnt transform He is joined in his crimefightingefforts by The Shovel William H Macy who wields the same and the effeteEnglish Blue Raja Hank Azaria whose talent is for operatically flinging widehis cape and hurling forks most of which end up sticking out of his companionsinstead of his foes            The firsttime directorwho goes by the superhero name of Kinka Usher overloads the movie withskewed angles and screwy lenses and grotesque special effects What keeps hiswork from becoming campily oppressive like the last dreadful Batmanpicture is his respect for the untranscendent flatness of ordinary life Thesenerds just cant quite get off the ground More than that theyre inherentlysuspicious of one another They see through their buddys superheroicposesand their own Stiller who struggles to turn his selfhatred intootherhatred makes a hilariously morose seether and Azaria is poeticallytwittyhe recalls Marlon Brandos Fletcher Christian The earnest Macy thewhitest man imaginable has been given an AfricanAmerican wife to whom hemust constantly defend his unrealized ambitions I shovel well I shovelvery well            These idiots can never measure up to the citys mostsuperheroic crime fighter Captain Amazing Greg Kinnear a preening egotistwho soars around on a jet pack trashing supervillains his uniform emblazonedwith product placements When all the heavyweight bad guys are dead or in jailand his celebrity endorsements dry up he contrives to have one of his oldnemeses Casanova Frankenstein Geoffrey Rush released from the insaneasyluma bad move as it turns out since Amazing has got rusty andFrankenstein has had plenty of time to hatch a diabolical scheme Among themisfits who join up with our three wouldbe superheroes to liberate CaptainAmazing are Paul Reubens who brings a glitteryeyed intensity to The Spleen apustuled lisper with toxic flatulence and the wonderful Janeane Garofalo asThe Bowler who hurls a ball in which the skull of her murdered father isghoulishly embedded            The script by NeilCuthbert deftly juggles the fantasy of what our heroes want to be and thereality of what they are They dont show grace under pressure but theysomehow rise to the occasion and Mystery Men becomes a triumphantcelebration of nerdy aspiration I might have complained that Stiller andGarofalowho instantly rub each other the wrong waydont end up falling inlove and that the film pairs Stiller instead with a conventional ingnue Butsince that ingnue is the meltingly gorgeous Claire Forlani it would takesomeone more superheroic than I to register a protest            The world didnt need a remake of The Thomas CrownAffair  an enjoyable piece of romantic fluff in which worldlymillionaire thief Steve McQueen matched wits with brittle insuranceinvestigator Faye Dunaway We didnt need it but we got it anywayand itspretty terrific The old script has been smartly overhauled and the directorJohn McTiernan  Die Hard   works with a mastercraftsmanselegance The climax in which an army of men in trench coats and bowler hatsswap identical portfolios is like a ballet designed by Magritte Its worthyof the Metropolitan Museum of Art in which it takes place True theres thehollow man Pierce Brosnan in the McQueen role but hes not bad here Hispassivity is archly amusing And then theres Rene Russo She makes herentrance in furs and a pair of sunglasses with creamy lips and mussed redhairboth sleek and sexily bedraggled When she cottons almost instantly tothe fact that Brosnan is her art thief she toys with him happy with the chaseand entertained by his effrontery You cant spot the moment when she falls inlove It must be when it dawns on her that shes the mouse and not the catBefore you know it shes roiling with doubt and heartbreakingly vulnerableand this slick thriller romance becomes more than an ultracivilized game Russohas never been less than agreeable but heres shes something else a moviestar
