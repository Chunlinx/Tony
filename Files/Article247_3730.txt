                                 Battle of the Democratic Underdogs            Running for president these days means convincing everyone that youre goingto win until they dont believe you at which point you must persuade them thatyoure behind            You can see this dynamic in the GoreBradley jockeying of recent days Twomonths ago the vicepresident was thought to be so far ahead as to beunassailable He was running against the putative Republican nominee George WBush not against his benign Democratic challenger Gore did not acknowledgethat the primary was a real contest The name Bill Bradley did not pass hislips            But thanks to a steady stream of media negativity toward Gore and hiscampaign and sympathy for Bradley polls began pointing to a closer race Andonce it became competitive Gore needed to play the expectations game in adifferent way By moving his campaign headquarters to Tennessee and challengingBradley to a series of debates Gore is trying to recast himself in theposition that has served Bradley well as a scrappy challenger and an outsiderrather than the frontrunner He is trying to build down expectations forhimself far enough that winning the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primaryby a slim margin will count as a victory rather than as failure to meetexpectations            You might think that Bradley would be pleased by his opponentsacknowledgement that its a horse race In fact Bradley hates being called thefrontrunner At a press conference last week he bristled at the notion thathe was expected to win the New York primary even though he is ahead there inthe polls What Bradley is hoping for is a surge to lift him up early nextyear carrying him to victory in the big primaries in New York California andthe Midwest A wave that crests now could be a ripple by early March            All this is happening so early that we might well go through a few moreturnarounds before voters actually pick the nominee Now that Bradley is deemedviable by the press hes beginning to receive harsher scrutiny A fewskeptical stories about him have already appeared Next will be articlessuggesting that Gore is far from done forhe has the wondereconomy on hisside is more moderate than Bradley has the superdelegates locked up etc Andthe whole expectations cycle will replay itself            This dynamic has not set in on the Republican sideyet George W Bush isstill running as if he lacks any serious opposition But at some point expectthe press to start treating some other candidate as a plausible and promisingcontender Polls will show a challenger closing the gap in Iowa or NewHampshire He or she will make the cover of Time  At that point Bushwill appear with Al Gores script before him He will call for early debatesembrace change and say he welcomes the challenge            PS I will try to start this groundswell for John McCain on Monday            Read more about Gores attempt to become the media underdog in this weeksPundit Central
