                well Liz do you own a boat   well my family has a has a sailboat and we havent actually been out in in it in a while um but we do   umhum um where do you sail at   theres a lake uh right at by our airport here in Dallas and uh Lake Grapevine and um actually i have not done much sailing i had uh i would i have crewed in it but ive never really gotten to where i feel comfortable you know doing the whole thing myself and had all kinds of plans to go out and take lessons and do it and uh for a while there we had flooded lakes and didnt have a chance to so i havent done that yet   how how large is your boat   im trying to remember uh probably uh i really cant remember uh its a boat that my sister and i had told my father whos in his seventies we had said you know maybe uh it would be nice maybe sometime wed like to learn more about sailing and um he he who he is the one who loves sailing and hes the one whos been in it and he just went out and bought a boat uh we didnt mean it that seriously so he went out and bought one he is not fun to sail with it is always a crisis and so um   umhum   he turned me off against it when i was young and then later different men men that i have known have had boats and and they made it fun but um he doesnt   thats too bad weve got weve got a boat it isnt a sail boat my i should say my family does also   uhhuh   its a its a fishing and ski boat itll hold about seven people   uhhuh   but we have a lot of fun uh every year we get together for a a week down on a place uh its uh its kind of a resort we have a time share down there and take the boat and water ski and and go fishing early in the mornings when the waters cold and   oh i bet thats fun   its a lot of fun and even the little kids uh enjoy it ive got uh a six year old and and of course some of the other family has some around eight or ten and we have a great big oh itll hold about probably five or six kids that size its a big   uhhuh   kind of like a a a water weenie that floats in the water and they can all get on it at once   oh oh how fun   and they just have a blast we put a a life jacket on everybody and then you know just pull them around and   yeah yeah   uh we burn up a tank or two of gas a day and get a really good sunburn  and just have a great time   i bet i bet   but my experience with boating and at at least that way i dont know the sailing might be different i i dont know i think id kind of be too impatient to uh       to sail but uh i dont know it might be kind of fun too just to uh relax and i guess its all wind powered isnt it when you sail   it is uh you you can have a motor on it and and a lot of them do i uh just because if you get out there and theres no wind its pretty hard to get back   umhum   i find it very relaxing i i think theyre theyre absolutely beautiful i you know i really as i say would like to learn to do it myself just got turned off early on by   um   a particular manner but um its a wonderful feeling my son and and and can sail and he and i have gone out but he likes to cut it right right to the  when youre going along with the wind you you you can get you can decide how much you want to heel and he loves to take it as far over as possible     hm   i find that   so thats additional speed when youre is that what you   yeah the closer to the wind you are   uhhuh   then youve seen sailboats out where theyre just way over     yes   and thats theyre just moving right on out   umhum     and uh thats his favorite way um even to the point where youve got to have someone on the up side you know putting some weight on there so you dont go over   i see and you always get to be the one thats hanging over the edge   well you know i mean since hes doing the other there you know where am i supposed to go so that that is not my favorite but um a friend who um i dated um years back uh and and i would go out and that was just wonderful youd   umhum sure hm   you know take some take a picnic and and go out and you can go in little coves and and its so quiet its it that thats something i love i mean i i like ski boats too   umhum hm   and the speed and you know going around but theres something extremely peaceful about a sail boat   well do you just drop an anchor when you find a place or do you just kind of let it go and you do take an anchor then and   yeah yeah yeah drop an anchor and you know thereve been the times when the anchor catches in something and you get   umhum uh oh   spend a lot of time yeah trying to get it back up et cetera but uh   cut the rope huh how how large is your boat how many how many people could go on it at once   um really comfortably about four adults   umhum   and uh   are are they set up so you can spend the night in them and   well not this one but but some are theres so many
