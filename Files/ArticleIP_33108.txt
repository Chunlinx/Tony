DearPrudence                                                      Im a grad studentat a large research university in the Midwest A cutie from Germanyalso agrad student in another departmentcaught my eye this past year and I ampositively smitten Although Ive made my affections for her very clear shehas turned me down for dates because she prefers the company of herEuroclique a group of grad students also from The Continent Frankly Ifind most of them annoying and downright dorky Thus it seems clear that myMidwestern roots turn her off What can I do to win this girlsaffections                                       RS                        Dear R            Tell her yourgrandfather was Kaiser Wilhelm Only kidding As a fellow Midwesterner Prudiefeels special kinship with you The thing you must do in a situation like thisis accept that peoples attractions are hardwired Have you noticed how oftenthe second spouse resembles the first There is a slim chance that this youngwoman is just not interested in you with no consideration of nationalityinvolved and is trying to let you down gently Prudies rule is an oldretailing maxim Your first markdown is your cheapest Do not wait around forthis girl to change her mind Just accept things as they are and cast your eyeelsewhere Prudie bets you a euro you will find another woman about whom youwill be smitten            Prudie romantically                                             DearPrudence                                                      I was raised in afamily where we were never big giftgivers On special days we each give ameaningful gift and mainly focus on having a nice meal or an outing togetherMy husbands family on the other hand sees Christmas and birthdays asoccasions for major asset transfers In other words they are more into dollarvalue than my family My dear husband was horrified last Christmas with myfamily when all he got was a shirt and tie I worry that my husbands familydoes not see our carefully chosen gifts as the sincere expression of love andaffection that they are Sometimes I feel trapped in a Polynesian cycle ofhumiliation by gift giving Any tips                                       Yourshumbly                                       DaughterinLaw                        Dear Daughter            You obviously march to adifferent drummer than your husband  one who is not highstepping throughNeiman Marcus The first thing is for you and your spouse to agree on anunderlying philosophy of gift giving The ideal Prudie thinks is choosing agift with some real thought behind it that does not break the bank Since yourhusband is used to lavish gifts the two of you should probably make a budgetfor presents It really is the thought that counts and Prudie hopes yourinlaws will come to appreciate your thoughtful choices            Prudie selectively                                             DearPrudie                                                      I am  years old and have a wonderfulboyfriend who is thoughtful kind understanding etc I have nothing bad tosay about him here it comes but I dont feel a real connection to him If Ilook at him from a logical standpoint he would be a perfect person with whomto spend the rest of my life I am physically attracted to him and I care forhim deeply but I just feel there is something missing I think all this hasbeen exacerbated by the fact that I recently had a conversation with a strangerto whom I felt more drawn than I do to my own man Nothing happened  justgreat conversation and what I felt was a real connection Weve only beengoing out five months so maybe I should give it more time I dont want tothrow away something very good just because of some need that may be foolishwhim Help                                       Hopelessly Confused                        Dear Hope            Love is not logical soforget that You may however have Immature Woman Syndrome intensified by TheHandsome Stranger Phenomenon Sometimes an inexperienced womana youngonewill be turned off when a guy is too nice And sometimes its justnot the right guy As you point out correctly five months is not enough timeto give you the answer Your need for connection is not a foolish whim Justbecause you cant put your finger on whats missing doesnt mean its notmissing On the other hand for many people real caring along with physicalattraction makes for a pretty pleasing situation Prudie suggests withoutchucking your current relationship you try to arrange another encounter withthe Handsome Stranger to see what happens a second time Assuming of courseyou didnt meet him on the subway and have no inkling of how to find himagain Life is choices and Prudie hopes you make a good one            Prudie thoughtfully                                             DearPrudie                                                      A friend of minefrom high school is getting married in the fall and has asked me and some otherwomen in our circle to be bridesmaids Financially we are all OK but by nomeans rich Her parents and her fiances parents are footing the bill for avery elaborate wedding and a honeymoon to Europe Her dress costs around to give you an idea The bridesmaid dresses she has picked out are which we are supposed to buy ourselves plus shoes plus specialundergarments So its basically about  that she is asking each of us tospend Is it rude of her to expect us to do this It seems so to us But  wefeel like we cant really say no to being her bridesmaids either How shouldwe handle the situation Can we ask her to have her dad pay for a portion ofthe dresses so its not a financial hardship for us                                       Sincerely                                       Disdressed                        Dear Dis            Prudie is a long wayfrom her bridesmaid days but interestingly enough your dilemma was faced bysomeone on whose birth certificate Prudies name just happens to be Thenumbers involved in that situation were roughly double the ones you mentionWhat happened there was that the brides dad paid half of each of the girlsdresses Afterward however one of the bridesmaids was so annoyed by thecostly selections that it ruined her friendship with the bride Prudie believesthat if a family of means picks attendants dresses that are out of the normalprice range they should foot the bill For some unknown reason bridesmaidsdresses are often worn only once  maybe because they are usually ugly Thisis just one of lifes little oddities As for your question about whether ornot the bride is rude in asking you all to shell out hundreds of dollars sheis not rude simply thoughtless Because your letter indicates that all yougirls have the same views about the expense one of you should speak to thebride on behalf of all the bridesmaids and say that her selection is a littlesteep for everyone and perhaps her dad might pay for half Prudie guesses shewill say yes            Prudie hopefully
