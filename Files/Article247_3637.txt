                                 You Cant Go Home Again                        Dear Russ            I like your story about Fernandina To me it precisely illustrates theimpossibility of starting over from scratch which is what towns likeCelebration promise            I like many aspects of Celebration The emphasis on sidewalks andwalkability the traditional design of the houses the smaller lots that give asense of place to the streets the back alleys that put the cars in thebackground and the planning that gives equal importance to the individualhouses and the common shared spaces What I am skeptical of is turning onesback on so many aspects of everyday American life For example I happen tolike Home Depot If I lived in Celebration I would have to drive some distanceto find one Nor do I remember seeing a service station Nor a car wash Nor astorage facility There is no motel but there is a bed and breakfast I happento prefer the former So much of what is necessary to the way we live today isrelegated to out there            Celebration doesnt tell us anything about how we could better arrange ourpresent lives how we could integrate and knit together convenience stores andHome Depots for example or neighborhoods and strip malls Inexpensive stripmalls whatever their appearance are where little business are born sincebudding entrepreneurs cant afford the rents that elegant town centers chargeJane Jacobs long ago wrote that successful cities needed a variety ofbuildings old as well as new which could serve a variety of functions Thecontradiction of a new town is that everything is new hence expensive That isone explanation for the lack of cheaper houses that both Ross andFrantzCollins bemoan There are no fixeruppers in Celebration This isobviously an unfair criticism yet it underlines the real limitations ofstarting over            There is another final aspect to this conundrum I teach a course aboutarchitecture and urban design to budding developers at the Wharton SchoolAfter a class on New Urbanism where I showed them several projects and tookthem to see Kentlands a large planned community in Maryland I asked them towrite a paper about the subject One of the students wrote If there was onequestion I would like to ask the people who live in these neotraditionalcommunities it would be What would it take to make you move It was aperceptive observation Starting over always promises stabilitythis time weare going to do it rightbut of course the world will not stop Somebodywill come up with a better idea Or at least what seems to be a better ideaat the time            Celebration is in many ways a better idea No doubt it is destined to takeits place among a long list of admirable experiments in visionary Americantownmaking Williamsburg Annapolis Savannah Forest Hills GardensRadburnand Seaside But they are experiments the mainstream will make itsown way as it always has done            All the bestWitold
