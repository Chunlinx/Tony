                                 Embarrassment of Riches                        Michael Lewis The New NewThing is the best book ever written about Silicon Valley            There Ive said it Said it to you wondering to besure whether you agreedo you said it to the readers of                   Slate                but most of all Ive said it tomyself Michael Lewis The New New Thingis the best book ever written about Silicon Valley There Ive said it again I suspect Ill be saying it a few more times beforeour backandforth is finished three days hence            From my point of view the reason for keeping thiscentral truth front and center at all times is that the books flaws are thekind that tend to drive me completely batty And so my natural tendency isgoing to be to harp on what hes done wrong rather than what hes done rightAnd what he has done right is something big and important He has absolutelycaptured what Silicon Valley is like at this moment in historyhow crazy itis how the old rules have been turned upside down how it is filled with thesense that anything is possible and that everyone will soon be rich if theyarent already You would think other people would have done this by now butthey havent And that is because very few people have Lewis ability tocapture something deep with a few deftly written scenes            There is a wonderful scene for instance that comesshortly after the books central character Jim Clark decides to start ahealthcare Web site eventually named Healtheon Now the first point ofcourse is that Clark doesnt really have a clue what this company is going todo Doesnt matter The venture capitalists are practically pleading with himto be allowed to invest in it            Then he goes out and hires one person an engineer heknew back at Silicon Graphics which he also founded That night the engineergoes home only to find that his fax machine is already overflowing with rsumsfrom all the other engineers who want innot even caring what the company willdo All they know is that its an Internet startup headed by Jim Clarkthe manwith the magic touch as Lewis describes himand thats all they need to knowAnd then after that engineer has hired a handful of his buddies to start thecompany they fly to Boston to meet with the bureaucrats at Blue CrossBlueShield to explain how theyre going to transform the healthcare system Whichthey know nothing about We sat up all night reading all this literature abouthealth care Lewis quotes one Healtheon employee as saying We asked Whatsthe problem we are going to solve here  Even more amazing Clark by then haslargely wandered off After all his job in his view is to come up with anidea however unformed and then cause money and people to coalesce around itThe trick Lewis writes in one of those wonderful Michael Lewis sentenceswas for Healtheon to get itself designated by the financial markets as theOfficial Health Care Sponsor of the Miracle Economy For this Clark reapsbillions once the IPO takes place as it inevitably does and gets to beviewed as great Silicon Valley visionary Its all quite mindboggling and asI say I really think Lewis has done a terrific job rendering this new world inall its insane particulars There is another scene I feel compelled tomentionthe one in which the investment bankers and the company executivesmeet to decide about taking Healtheon publicthat is by itself worth theprice of the book            And now please allow me to gripe for a few minutes Isit possible that Michael Lewis has too much talent for his own good Afterreading this book I think it isand thats what made me so nuts as I wasreading The New New Thing  There is no problem hecant solve no hole he cant fill with a graceful turn of the phrase Butthat also means that when confronted with the choice between doing a littleextra digging and writing his way around a problem he chooses the latter everytime The thing that struck me particularly in this regard was Healtheons IPOThe original IPO was canceled because at the time it was scheduled to takeplace the market was tanking and the companys road show had been a bust Butthen some months later Healtheon goes public and is a huge success Whathappened in the interim We have no idea because Lewis never bothers to tellus All he says is No one asked how a company the stock market deemedunworthy was now suddenly desirable It just happened Well that may benice writing but its pretty unsatisfying journalism            In fact I dont know if you noticed or not but Lewisnever once explains what Healtheon is supposed to do It is supposed to somehowinsert itself in the systembut how Lewis has a lot of fun showing how fuzzythe concept is at the beginning but by the end of the book Healtheon is anactual company with an actual product that does  what exactly I couldntbegin to tell you            Of course maybe the problem is that this book waswritten with great haste There seems to be a belief among publishers that ifyou dont get your Silicon Valley book out fast it will be outdated beforeits published And maybe theyre right What do you think And what do youthink of the amount of time Lewis lingers over Clarks damn boat Ill be happyto tell you what I think about that tomorrow though I guess Ive alreadytipped my hand
