                                  Leak and Load            Nostradamus apparentlyworks in the Pentagon According to the April  US News  WorldReport  this is what the Joint Chiefs of Staff concluded before theKosovo operation If we bomb  we will eliminate Milosevics domesticopposition and he will become a hero He will go into Kosovo and slaughterthousands of Kosovar Albanians and create thousands of refugees Air power orbombing cannot stop any of those things            The front page ofMondays Washington Post confirmed the prophecy revealing that theJoint Chiefs had expressed deep reservations in advance of the proposedbombing The New York Times reported that the Pentagon had warned theadministration that Milosevic was likely to strike out viciously againstKosovo Albanians            These wise men who saw in their crystal ball exactly whatwould happen in Kosovo are truly prophets without honor Theseprognosticationsdivulged anonymously by senior military officials andPentagon planners and officers who know the Joint Chiefs thinking butdecline to be namedrepresent a particularly demoralizing aspect of modernwarmaking leaking as Pentagon policy            Covering your ass is ofcourse a timehonored military tradition enshrined with its own acronym Butwhat is remarkable about the Kosovo leaks is that they are covering somethingthat is not being shot at No oneliterally no one is blaming the USmilitary for the shortcomings of the Kosovo mission All fault has beendeposited on the doorsteps of the White House and the State DepartmentPoliticians not generals made the risky decisions and politicians notgenerals are getting reproached for them But no matter As soon as it becameclear that the mission had gone awry Pentagon brass began leakingprofligately In the span of a few days anonymous quotes appeared in thePost  New York Times  Los Angeles Times  WashingtonTimes  Wall Street Journal  and all three newsweeklies The gist ofthe leaks The Joint Chiefs knew this would happen they told theadministration this would happen so dont blame them            The leaks stem from a basic military practiceworstcasing During Vietnam generals insisted to their civilian bosses thatwe could win if we just had a little more time and firepower Todays armedforces wont make the same mistake They dont want to be put in a hopelessposition and get blamed for it This is a product of Vietnam says GeorgeWashington University military historian Ronald Spector            So even as the brass announces incessantly thatAmerica has the finest fighting force the world has ever known it respondsbleakly to any presidential proposal to actually deploy that force A topPentagon officer from the Gulf War describes the generals standard procedureThey tell the White House You are going to need an overwhelming amount ofstuff Its a bad idea There will be terrible casualties We recommend youdont do it             You always makesure you have protested before says American University Professor AmosPerlmutter In Kosovo for example the generals said that a ground invasionwould require  troops a number they knew was impossibly high and thatbombing wouldnt work This worstcasing has two results  The politiciansare left wondering whether to believe the generals since they say thisevery time and  the military assures itself a victory in the war thatmatters in Washington the PR war            If the pols overrule the generals and the mission goessour the generals are safe ontherecord with sensible objections that can beleaked at an opportune moment as with Kosovo If the pols overrule and themission succeeds the generals still harvest the credit No one remembers theirpoormouthing Who recalls that Gen Colin Powell predicted horrible casualtiesin the Gulf War            Its worth noting thatthe Joint Chiefs probably did not warn against the mission as emphatically orprophetically as the leaks claim Clinton after all is incredibly deferentialto his Joint Chiefs because of his own history of nonservice Its impossibleto believe that he would have overruled the chiefs if they were as absolute asthe leaks suggest Most experts also doubt the Joint Chiefs were unified in theview that bombing wouldnt succeed Its Air Force doctrine that bombingwill succeed in such circumstances so Air Force advisers almostcertainly predicted a bombing triumph Moreover the generals public behaviorcasts doubt on the claim that they foresaw what Milosevic would do if webombed The only public concerns the generals voiced before bombing were thatpilots would be vulnerable to Yugoslavias missile defenses They did notdiscuss the possibility that Milosevic would respond by accelerating hisslaughter of Kosovars            There is nothing wrong with the Joint Chiefs warning theadministration privately that bombing was folly In fact it would be derelictfor the generals not to warn the administration of that Butafterthefact anonymous leaks are corrupting The military istheoretically a nonpolitical institution but as soon as the operation wentsouth the military abandoned its nonpolitical faade to protect itself Fromfourstars to privates the armed forces loathe and distrust Clinton and thegenerals certainly werent going to risk being associated with his Kosovo messSo they leaked to guarantee that they would not be blamed for a quagmire or bepunished at budget timeand to ensure that Clinton would suffer The backdoorsniping has become so pernicious and prevalent that even retired Gen GeorgeJoulwan NATOs military commander in the early s pleaded on CNNsCrossfire for the Pentagon to stop leaking and pull the teamtogether            The principal reason the leaks are troubling is notthat they sabotage the relationship between the administration and thePentagon that relationship is always shaky They are troubling because theymay sabotage the mission itself The leaks suggest to our NATO allies that theUS military isnt seriously engaged in the operation And the leaks suggestto our own troops that their commanders secretly believe their mission isdangerous useless and possibly doomed No insidethebeltway PR victory isworth that kind of demoralization
