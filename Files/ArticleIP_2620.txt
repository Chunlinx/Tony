once actually hesays it more than  times whats  for a workshop next to the veritablemillions youll make as soon as youve learned the surefire techniques ofbuying options on margin            True enough But how do those techniques workHeres the very short version There are two kinds of optionscalls andputsboth of which you can buy and sell When you buy a call you purchase theright to buy a
