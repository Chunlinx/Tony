                                 Keeping Public Education Vital                        Dear Ann            How can school systems get and keep excellent teachers Good question I dothink that a good curriculum is part of the answer And I think the CoreCurriculum is a good start From what Ive read Hirsch has sane ideas aboutreading which is no small thing I like his emphasis on biographies andmythology in the younger grades He gives an important place to music and arta good idea from my point of view His curriculum is fairly new and iscurrently used in less than a thousand schools and I suspect that in time andas more schools adopt the program the curriculum will evolve If Hirsch andhis followers are openminded and they seem to be they will want toexperiment with variations            To Bennetts credit he has chosen to promote a pretty solid curriculum Hecould have picked one of the teacherproof regimens that have teachersreciting scripted lessons all day long I understand that many teachers arerelieved to have such a script but I am sure that with guidance most of themwould be happier using a more openended approach The question is how to givesuch guidance Good principals can certainly help I agree with you thatBennett does not draw a satisfactory picture of what a principals role shouldbe            By the way the unions play an important role in attracting good teachersDecent wages and working conditions are not a side issue I suppose its notsurprising that Bennett would be hostile to the unions considering that theunions usually support the Democrats and he is a Republican But I wish he hadrecognized how many helpful things the unions do not just in regard to wagesand working conditions In New York the teachers union runs a program calledDialATeacher that answers homework questions in English SpanishHaitianCreole French Greek Italian and Chinese which is really quiteuseful Give it a try  This sort of program is much more than aPR gimmick Not that unions are perfect            I have to make a confession about school choice I became a teacher in thes because I was deeply affected by the books of Herbert Kohl JonathanKozol and George Dennison At that time I believed that the public schoolswere hopeless The conditions were too dreadful The teachers andadministrators were too racist The system was intractable What to do For alot of young educators like me the answer was to start our ownschoolsalternative schoolswhich at the time meant private schools Now thesides have changed Liberals like me understand that our society had bettermake the public schools work People like Bennett have given up I waswrongmea culpain the s and Bennett is wrong today Farsightededucators have shown that you can make superior public schools even in poorneighborhoods There is room in the publicschool system more than there usedto be for people with ambition and ideas True there is a risk that inpromoting publicschool alternatives neighborhood schools will be left withthe most difficulttoeducate children and not enough resources to meet thetask As for charter schools I dont think we have enough information yetCharter schools are public schools that operate outside of the bureaucraticsystem and in some places that might be good in other places not so goodConcerning vouchers my fear is that they will undermine a sense of the publicgood in education            I agree with you that Bennett is promoting a getitforyourkid attitudeSo what if some other kids are left in the lurch is the implication It is nota very attractive idea of what American society should be like Still Bennettsbook has some good ideas too as you and I agree and it has given us theopportunity to bat around our own ideas which has been funPeggy
