                    Background        Cirrhosis is a pathologic condition characterized by        fibrosis of the liver parenchyma and evidence of        regenerative activity     It is a common pathologic        endpoint for a number of processes including damage by        toxins metabolic diseases or virusinduced hepatitis        autoimmune hepatitis passive congestion secondary to heart        failure or infection with parasites The epidemiology of        cirrhosis is linked to both alcohol consumption              and the prevalence of hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus        infections     Worldwide cirrhosis is the cause of        approximately  thousand deaths per year     The        majority of these are in developing nations where viral        hepatitis is the main underlying cause of cirrhosis In        developed nations alcohol is a major cause of cirrhosis        but the early mortality risk attributed to alcohol in        younger age groups  years old is somewhat offset by        the proposed beneficial effect of alcohol on cardiovascular        mortality            The diagnosis of cirrhosis has both prognostic and        therapeutic implications     The life expectancies for        persons diagnosed with cirrhosis are significantly reduced              compared with age and sexmatched controls        with the exception of certain pathological subtypes            The likelihood of variceal bleeding is reported to be        greatest within the first two years of diagnosis            Owing to the high mortality risk associated with variceal        hemorrhage primary prophylaxis against a first bleed        becomes an important therapeutic intervention     There        are several other therapies that are clinically useful for        patients with established cirrhosis      as well as        therapies for specific causes of liver disease such as        viral hepatitis            Cirrhosis may be suspected from physical examination        findings     with imaging studies frequently        supporting the diagnosis It is known though that imaging        studies are limited in their ability to make a definite        assessment in patients with diffuse infiltrative conditions        of the liver     Ultrasound the most widely used        modality is neither sensitive nor specific for the        diagnosis of cirrhosis     Estimates of the        sensitivity range from  to  and specificity between         and       Despite certain limitations liver        biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis This        procedure is not without risk There is a small mortality        risk of around  percent together with the resulting        discomfort and other nonfatal complications             The patchy or regional nature of hepatic changes means that        percutaneous liver biopsies may miss the diagnosis of        cirrhosis in  percent of patients with the condition                   Given the invasive nature of the diagnostic standard        there has been interest in whether noninvasive diagnosis        of cirrhosis might be possible      Physical        examination is a diagnostic tool available to every        clinician This study was conducted to review the published        literature on clinical examination of patients with known        or suspected liver disease and identify the validity and        generalizability of primary studies that distinguished        those with cirrhosis from those without A summary of        diagnostic test performance for elements of the physical        examination was derived using metaanalytic methods for        diagnostic studies Where possible effects of study        characteristics on summary estimates were determined by        subgroup analysis                    Methods                  Study identification          Two online searches of the National Library of          Medicine MEDLINE database were performed using the PubMed          search engine The searches covered the years           The last search was completed on August   The          first search utilized the Clinical Queries tool using          the term cirrhosis and the options diagnosis and          specificity A second search combined medical subject          headings MeSH Signs and Symptoms Physical          Examination and Medical History Taking linked by OR          terms with a text word search for cirrhosis through          an AND term The resulting set was further limited by the          term human and by excluding reviews editorials or          letters The titles of the resulting citations were          scanned Abstracts of potentially relevant articles were          then retrieved If the article appeared likely to satisfy          inclusion criteria from information available in the          abstract or if no abstract was available the full text          article was evaluated Additional articles were sought by          scanning

articles on liver disease cirrhosis          or physical examination or other potentially relevant          chapters in books The authors of primary studies          identified through literature searches were contacted by          letter or by email or both seeking data not presented in          the published study and to enquire about knowledge of          unpublished or additional studies                          Study selection criteria          Articles were included if they evaluated patients          with known or suspected liver disease or cirrhosis          evaluated items obtained by physical examination          described liver biopsy results and provided data          sufficient to calculate sensitivity and specificity of          elements of the clinical examination in the detection of          cirrhosis Studies that evaluated only biochemical or          radiological examinations were excluded                          Validity assessment          The validity of included articles was evaluated for          the following four criteria     by one author          GdB independent blind comparison against a reference          standard of diagnosis evaluation in an

recommendations of          Midgette           et al    and are similar to          methods outlined in a recent review     The          correlation between sensitivity and specificity was          tested using Spearmans rank correlation coefficient          Where sensitivity and specificity were significantly          correlated Spearmans    a Summary Receiver          Operating Characteristic SROC curve was used to          summarize the data Where the correlation between          sensitivity and specificity was  or negative          homogeneity of sensitivity and specificity was tested by          chisquare tests of association If sensitivity and          specificity were both homogeneous a summary estimate of          sensitivity and specificity were independently derived          using a randomeffects model REM If the sensitivity          and specificity were heterogeneous no summary estimate          was derived The SROC curves were created using the          method described by Moses           et al      The SROC curve          depicts the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity          across different studies with explicit or implicit          variation in test threshold Unweighted regression          analyses were examined to determine the SROC curve          Symmetry of the SROC curve was confirmed by determining          whether the slope of the fitted regression line differed          significantly from zero The point of maximum joint          sensitivity and specificity was determined from the          curve as an overall summary measure In some instances          the SROC curve did not extend to a point where          sensitivity is equal to specificity In those instances          the REM summary estimates were used to describe the data          Statistical significance was assigned to a           P value less than                           Subgroup analyses          Where a minimum of three studies per subgroup were          present

included           males  and  females  The median study          size was  patients with an interquartile range of           to  Most of the included studies took place in          referral

reported an          estimated duration of illness which varied from a total          duration of illness of less than six months to a mean of           months Comorbid illness was mentioned in one study             that enrolled patients with inherited coagulation          disorders usually hemophilia Fifteen of these patients           were also infected with the Human Immunodeficiency

biopsy were not provided in any of the          studies However it is reasonable to infer that the          biopsy was performed by expert clinicians in at least ten          of the studies namely those that originated in referral          centers Eleven of twelve studies reported that either          the clinical examination was performed prior to the          biopsy           and that blinded pathologists read          the biopsy or that at least the examination was          performed prior to the biopsy It was generally not          stated how many examiners reviewed the biopsies            n   The reliability of the          pathological diagnosis was assessed in a single study              These investigators reported that biopsies were          examined by two experienced pathologists Good agreement          beyond chance    was present for the pathological          diagnoses in this study Three other studies stated that          a single examiner reviewed the slides      and          one stated that experience pathologists reviewed the          slides              In nine studies the biopsy was performed irrespective          of the findings on clinical examination In the          casecontrol study     the control group did not          undergo liver biopsy In two studies      it was          not clear whether the decision to perform the biopsy was          taken independently of clinical data Five studies          reported on exclusions         These ranged          from   of  to   of  Common          reasons for exclusion were the presence of          contraindications to biopsy the patient did not undergo          biopsy or inadequate biopsy          In all studies examiners were not blinded to other          clinical information In some cases the entire history          and examination was performed together In other cases          multiple physical signs were evaluated Only two studies          gave any details regarding the specific clinical methods          used      and four mentioned the explicit          threshold for abnormality of a clinical finding                 Five studies did not state how many examiners          assessed each patient four studies reported that a          single examiner was used and three studies used two          examiners to evaluate physical signs Reliability was          assessed in four studies        although          results were only provided in one study     and for          only three clinical indicants These investigators found          good agreement beyond chance for liver firmness

findings were reported in three          of more studies SROC curves were constructed for          splenomegaly and hepatomegaly Figures and  The data          for ascites were unsuitable for SROC analysis and so          were combined using summary measures from a REM The          maximum joint sensitivity and specificity of the finding          of splenomegaly was  and  for hepatomegaly          A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the          effect of inclusion of those studies most liable to          various types of bias When the casecontrol study             was excluded from the analysis of the hepatomegaly data          the SROC curve was essentially unchanged A joint maximum          sensitivity and specificity for the revised hepatomegaly          SROC curve was  data not shown By comparison          exclusion of the study in which clinical and pathological          assessments were not independent    from the          splenomegaly dataset resulted in a dramatic change The          SROC curve for this data was greatly influenced by the          presence of this outlying point Randomeffects estimates          for the revised splenomegaly data of sensitivity were            CI    and specificity   CI                      Data on seven physical signs were combined using          summary measures derived from a REM as shown in Table           The data for palmar erythema was heterogeneous and          unsuitable for metaanalysis Reported sensitivity ranged          from  to  and specificity ranged from  to           A further ten physical signs were evaluated in          single studies The diagnostic accuracy for these          findings is represented in Table                           Subgroup analyses of SROC analyses          Subgroup analyses were possible for splenomegaly and          ascites None of the covariates examined namely study          size study design etiology of cirrhosis and          independence of measurements resulted in a significant          difference in diagnostic performance of the physical sign          in question There was significant heterogeneity of TPR          and TNR in the subgroup of studies reporting splenomegaly          that had assessed biopsy findings with knowledge of the          clinical findings                            Discussion        The present study attempted to summarize data from        primary sources in the published medical literature on the        diagnostic accuracy of clinical findings for the diagnosis        of cirrhosis The studies identified represent a rather        select population Studies were primarily conducted in        referral centers by clinicians experienced in dealing with        liver disease seeing patients with increased clinical        suspicion of the disorder of interest The underlying        etiology of liver disease was not comprehensively reported        and in several studies no description of the patient        population was given Few studies described their clinical        methods where several exist for eliciting a finding              These are deficiencies that should be carefully        addressed in designing future studies that evaluate aspects        of clinical practice such as the history or physical        examination These deficiencies are a phenomenon that is        not restricted to studies of clinical evaluation of liver        disease adding support to the call for more rigorous        studies of the clinical examination            The summary measures derived from the data presented        here demonstrate that the physical findings elicited in the        primary studies have high specificity though generally low        sensitivity for detecting cirrhosis As expected physical        signs consistent with advance portal hypertension or severe        liver dysfunction decompensated cirrhosis like ascites        abdominal wall veins collateral circulation or        encephalopathy had high specificity of over  There was        significant heterogeneity in the reported diagnostic        accuracy of palmar erythema precluding metaanalysis In        the case of the physical signs splenomegaly and        hepatomegaly studies indicated the presence of a variation        in test threshold as an explanation for the variation in        test accuracy In the case of splenomegaly however this        finding was sensitive to the inclusion of one study with        potential for bias of the diagnostic accuracy of clinical        evaluation        Subgroup analyses were not able to detect variation in        accuracy as a consequence of study characteristics The        small number of studies available conferred low power to        detect such differences Data were insufficient to examine        other study characteristics that may have influenced study        outcome such as age of participants cause of liver        disease or symptom duration Increases in age or duration        of illness may bias studies towards higher prevalence of        cirrhosis        The present study employed a comprehensive search        strategy Formal criteria for study inclusion were defined        prior to analysis of the search results We were unable to        find previous attempts to summarize the accuracy of        clinical examination for diagnosis of cirrhosis in the        medical literature Our results agree however with        comparisons spanning five decades of the antemortum        clinical diagnosis with subsequent autopsy studies                   This study has several limitations Firstly a question        remains on the choice of diagnostic reference standard        Liver biopsy is likely to underestimate the actual        prevalence of cirrhosis     Methods to overcome this        limitation include examining multiple biopsies One study        required three successive negative biopsies to exclude the        diagnosis of cirrhosis     Although this approach        addresses the concern of sampling variability it is        questionable whether it could be considered in future        studies using biopsy as the gold standard as it may not be        ethically defensible This remains an area for improvement        in future studies and consensus on standardization        Misclassification of patients by an imperfect reference        test will lead to bias in the assessment of a diagnostic        test      In general an imperfect reference test        will underestimate the performance of a diagnostic test        Sample calculations to show how such errors in a reference        test lead to alterations in the apparent sensitivity and        specificity of a diagnostic test are presented in Appendix         and  see Additional file  Appendices These        calculations are based on methods developed by Gart and        Buck     As can be seen a diagnostic test with true        sensitivity of  would appear to have a sensitivity of        only  if the reference standard against which it was        measured had an imperfect sensitivity and specificity of         and  respectively Metaanalytic methods have been        described to adjust for imperfections in the reference        standard although those techniques were not applied to the        data presented here            Secondly it is likely that other types of bias were        present in some of these studies Empirical observation of        the quantitative effects of study design flaws on the        findings of diagnostic studies has shown that casecontrol        designs studies that use different reference tests for        positive and negative results of the diagnostic test under        study and lack of blinding led to overestimation of        diagnostic test accuracy     One casecontrol study        was retrieved in the searches     No important        difference was noted in the hepatomegaly SROC curve        whether this particular study was included or not One        retrospective study appeared to have a significant risk of        bias from lack of blinding     The exclusion of this        study from the splenomegaly SROC significantly altered the        analysis of this data showing the vulnerability of the        metaanalysis to this form of study bias        Several other forms of bias have not been shown to be        important predictors of variation in assessment of        diagnostic accuracy     Selection bias refers to the        bias that may result if not all patients with the condition        under study are consecutively included Such a bias may        have influenced the results of at least one study        reference  Verification bias refers to the bias that        may occur if the reference test is applied based on the        results of the diagnostic test being studied Several        studies were described as having exclusions which raised        the possibility of selective application of the gold        standard Statistical methods for evaluating diagnostic        test performance in the presence of such partial        verification have been described but require the        application of a second initial diagnostic test            Consequently such an approach was not used in this        paper        Thirdly the data obtained were insufficient to assess        the effect of study location on diagnostic accuracy The        decrease in specificity of physical signs as patients are        referred from primary to tertiary care settings in which        most of these studies were performed has been described            As most of the studies utilized persistently        elevated aminotransferase levels as eligibility criteria        rather than the physical signs under study no data are        available to evaluate whether over or underrecognition by        the referring clinicians led to an altered specificity in        results of the cited article        Fourth the available data did not allow an analysis of        how individual patient characteristics affect diagnostic        accuracy of physical findings It has been observed that        cirrhosis undetected during life was a finding typical of        elderly patients     Similarly the prevalence of        certain physical findings or alternatively the ability to        detect those signs may vary between patients of different        race            Fifth this study cannot assess the independence of        isolated clinical findings The role and diagnostic        accuracy of items from the clinical history were not        examined It is likely that some of the study clinicians        were aware of indicants from the clinical history Whether        these elements of the evaluation made clinicians examine        patients more intensively than those with a negative        history is unknown The possibility also exists that        finding one physical sign may have heightened attempts by        examining clinicians to elicit further signs If clinicians        utilized additional maneuvers hence deviating from their        usual course of clinical examination on the strength of        finding other more easily elicited signs the study results        may have become biased The appropriateness of examining an        isolated clinical sign may also be challenged            Sixth data from the primary studies are limited on the        specific clinical maneuvers used to derive the estimates of        diagnostic accuracy Thus the findings cannot be related        to the accuracy of a specific clinical approach        This study may have implications for how clinicians        perform and interpret their clinical examination findings        Perloff recently drew attention to the ongoing importance        of skillful clinical evaluation in cardiovascular disease            These data show that in patients with cirrhosis        individual clinical signs usually have low sensitivity        with high specificity Thus physical signs cannot be used        to exclude the diagnosis of cirrhosis given these        performance characteristics Signs are likely to be more        useful to clinicians in the discrimination of patients with        disease by identifying patients with a higher likelihood of        cirrhosis thereby rulingin the diagnosis     The        main obstacle to the timely use of such an approach is the        finding that signs with the highest specificity are those        present in decompensated disease        This study has implications for clinical research This        study has highlighted the selected nature of existing data        on diagnostic accuracy of clinical examination and        measurement parameters for cirrhosis Attempts to further        define diagnostic accuracy of clinical examination will        have to consider how to define and measure independently        the contribution of individual covariates or physical        signs and which combination of cofactors has the highest        sensitivity specificity or positive predictive value A        potentially useful consideration would be the gain in        sensitivity and specificity that might result from using a        combination of signs Further attention should be devoted        to finding ways to identify patients with cirrhosis        Noninvasive laboratory testing such as serologic or        molecular markers imaging studies or improved biopsy        techniques appear to be the principal avenues open to        innovation in this area                    Conclusions         Most studies examining the diagnostic accuracy of        clinical examination have been undertaken in highly        selected populations         Physical signs are generally of low sensitivity for        the diagnosis of cirrhosis and signs with higher        specificity are associated with clinically decompensated        disease thus no rules of generality can be deduced         Physical signs are not useful for excluding the        presence of cirrhosis but may be useful to indicate the        presence of cirrhosis in a person with moderate to high        pretest suspicion of disease Physical signs need to be        utilized with additional clinical criteria to augment the        probability of identifying patients with
