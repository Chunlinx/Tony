                                 Whistling Dixie            A perpetual debate goes onabout how much of the real South is left Peter Applebome observes near thestart of his own Southern tour Is it still distinctive or is it now justTopeka with more fried food road kill heat and history            In Dixie Rising Applebomes eminently balanced portrait of todays South the veteranAtlantabased reporter for the New York Times turns this debate on itshead He asks instead Is the rest of America distinctive or is it now justMacon with worse winters manners and musical rhythm The most strikingaspect of American life at the centurys end he writes is how much thecountry looks like the South            Thisfresh take on the region should disabuse anyone who still imagines the South asa Gothic amalgam of Deliverance  Gone With the Wind  and WalkerEvans photos of holloweyed sharecroppers Applebomes South is economicallyvibrant politically and culturally selfconfident and racially moreintegrated than the rest of America But Dixie Rising is no blithe blurbfor the Sun Belt Applebome warns that if the Southern doctrines now sweepingthrough Americastates rights low taxes and quasifundamentalistChristianity among other thingsdo for the country what theyve done forDixie we may all be in trouble            In his earnest efforts to give the South a fair shakeApplebome a native Long Islander now raising a family in Georgia begins bypuncturing Northern stereotypes and sanctimony about the South He points outthat the Black Belt and Mississippi Delta long regarded as racist backwatersnow have more black elected officials than any other region of America We seea penitent George Wallace joining blacks in celebrating the  Selma marchand telling the Rev Joseph Lowery of the Southern Christian LeadershipConference I love you Black and white people love you And we see how theSouth has become the nations new industrial heartland creating half the newjobs in America even Mississippi long the nations bottomfeeder hasprospered thanks to legalized gambling                           DixieRising is structured around visits to  Southern locales with each oneused to illustrate the confluence of Southern and national trends Raceinevitably emerges as a principal theme According to Applebome no place inthe South has tried harder to overcome the regions harsh racial legacy thanCharlotte NC It was the first majoritywhite city in the South to elect ablack mayor twicefailed Senate aspirant Harvey Gantt and remains committedto school integrationeven as whites in other cities have flocked to privateseg academies            But this racial progress is fragile and insome ways phony Charlottes racial comity has not been born solely of itsresidents love of their neighbors A calculated civic boosterism so exuberantthat the citys chamber of commerce slogan was once CharlotteA Good Place toMake Money has spurred the citys desire to appear enlightened Andintegration has its limits Applebome recounts his visit to a white church thatrecruited a black pastor only to see its transracial experiment fail Thewhite parishioners fled and blacks retreated to the borderline separatistrhetoric of empowerment and selfreliance            The South is also acautionary blueprint for the nation when it comes to economic developmentApplebomes discussion of South Carolina probes the dirty secret behind Dixiesstunning rise from poverty its rabid antiunionism or what one historiancalls the Souths most respectable prejudice As one labor leader says ofStrom Thurmond Hell accept blacks now but you still dont see Strom shakinghands with union people The Souths Faustian bargainsend us jobs anyjobs in exchange for cheap nonunion laborhas undermined Northern workersand made the South the badjob capital of America This balmy businessclimate has also led to gross neglect of workers safety To cite just oneexample  North Carolina workers died during a chickenplant fire in due to locked exit doors that were blocked off so workers wouldnt stealchickens                           Dixie                Rising s account of the Souths political rise covers morefamiliar ground massive population shifts toward the Sun Belt that have tippedthe electoral balance the adoption by the Republican Party of Southernpolitical stances most of them rooted in a visceral hatred of government andthe ascent to power of a Southern president vice president House speakerSenate majority leader and majority whip and GOP chairman            Some of this political analysis shaped by the Republican landslide has been lapped by events Applebome devotes a chapter toNewt Gingrichs district in Cobb County Ga which he says epitomizes thenational trend towards suburban whiteflight Christianright conservatismBut the  election casts doubts on Cobb County as a model for America Whilethe South and the nation may still be moving rightward Newts currentunpopularity as well as Southern Democrats ability to hold their own thisyear suggests that the relentless rise of Dixies rightwing Republicanism hasslowed at least for now The evangelical tone of Dixiedriven conservatism mayalso help account for the growing alienation from the GOP among voters in NewEngland and the industrial Midwest            AndApplebome goes too far when he suggests that an even more reactionary strain ofSouthern thoughtneoConfederate ideologyhas gone mainstream in AmericaIts true that the cult of the Lost Cause is resurgent in the South albeitstripped of its onceblatant segregationism Its also true there are closeparallels between the Contract With America and the Confederate constitutionwhich not only enshrined states rights but also included term limits budgetbalancing and limits on taxation But when neoConfederate ideology wentnational with the presidential candidacy of Pat Buchanan who passionatelydefended displaying the rebel battle flag over the South Carolina statehousemost Americansindeed most South Caroliniansfound his retrorebel views tooextreme To suggest as Applebome does that its hard to know these dayswhere the Confederacy ends and the Republican Party begins is to lump the GOPwith some farout folk many of whom genuinely believe in black New World Orderhelicopters and the genetic inferiority of the black race            Such occasional overreaching aside Applebomesis a shrewd fair and entertaining guide to the region In Nashville he showshow country and western has become the predominant music of white America withGarth Brooks having outsold every recording artist in the United States exceptthe Beatles In Mississippi Applebome mixes vivid landscape writing withvisits to the states tacky casinos Throughout he displays a deft and livelygrasp of Southern history and letters popular culture and cuisine Pickledpigs feet are the opposite of an acquired taste he writes Unless youreborn eating them you never will The narrative is laced throughout withcolorful distinctly Southern characters including a Delta store owner whodisplays a Happy Holidays sign year round we have a holiday every twomonths or so and a Georgia rabbi whose  rock n roll temple fuses Jewishand Southern ways were sort of reconformadox            Nowhereis this books lovehate affair with the South more obvious than at the endwhen Applebome profiles Lewis Grizzard the Georgia humorist and newspapercolumnist who asked that his ashes be spread on the  yard line of the GeorgiaBulldogs stadium After an admiring review of Grizzards wit the author turnson the writer for peddling a nostalgic vision of a homogeneous preintegrationSouth Grizzards idealized South was the world before feminists andaffirmative action when gays stayed in the closet where they belonged whereAmerica pretty much meant the world of smalltown white folks like him            The South that is triumphant now concludesApplebome is one that both Grizzard and neoConfederates would celebrate aplace of feelgood nostalgia easy answers and painless solutions foreverlooking backward through a pale mist and seeing only the soft focus outlines ofwhat it wants to see It exalts states rights while ignoring the doctrinesugly racial legacy and rants against the federal government while convenientlyforgetting Washingtons role in salvaging the regions economy with militaryspending and other aid Applebome sketches the alternative promise of a proudlyinterracial South that has gone through the fire of change and come outredeemed The problem is little else in his book suggests that this dreamwill become reality            Having recently traveled tomany of the places Applebome visited I found his warm but withering portraitof Dixie to ring true The muchhyped New South may have shed Dixies overtracism and acquired the same neon surfaces as the rest of America But it canstill look a lot like the Old South And it remains a far cry from Topeka
