                    Introduction        Osteoclasts are large multinucleated boneresorbing        cells derived from the monocytemacrophage lineage            Their boneresorbing capacity is unique no other cell        shares this capability Osteoclasts are critical for both        the continuous remodeling of normal bone tissue as well as        the repair of fractured bones     During normal bone        remodeling osteoclastmediated bone resorption is balanced        by osteoblastmediated bone formation resulting in the        maintenance of skeletal bone mass As a consequence        osteoclast dysregulation leads to osteoporosis decreased        bone mass caused by excess osteoclast activity or to        osteopetrosis increased bone mass caused by insufficient        osteoclast activity Considering the tremendous morbidity        and cost of metabolic bone diseases     improving our        molecular understanding of osteoclast development and        function is critical towards the design of therapies to        combat these prevalent diseases        The molecular signals required for osteoclastogenesis        have recently been elucidated              Receptoractivator of NFB ligand RANKL a tumor necrosis        factor superfamily ligand expressed by stromal cells        osteoblasts and activated T cells binds to its cognate        receptoractivator of NFB RANK receptor on        macrophagesmonocytes inducing a signal that gradually        transforms the macrophages into osteoclasts over a period        of several days      While this interaction occurs        largely in the bone microenvironment it has been shown        that monocytes from the spleen peripheral blood and        synovium are all capable of RANKLdependent osteoclast        formation     Convincing evidence has been generated        indicating that the RANKRANKL interaction is absolutely        required for osteoclastogenesis     in the absence of        these molecules osteoclastogenesis cannot occur                   While the RANKRANKL signal is absolutely required for        osteoclastogenesis the efficiency of this process is        influenced by cytokines The proinflammatory cytokines        tumor necrosis factor alpha IL and IL augment        osteoclastogenesis       while IL IL IL        and IFN antagonize osteoclastogenesis         in vitro        It is        probable that cytokines play a vital role in the delicate        balance of bone remodeling and that therapies based upon        their natural biological function can be designed        IFN is a cytokine secreted primarily by activated T        cells and NK cells whose role in bone biology is only        beginning to be clarified It was originally characterized        as a powerful macrophage activator that upregulated nitric        oxide NO production and MHC expression in macrophages            It has since been shown to stimulate antiviral and        antibacterial activities to differentiate Th cells toward        Th fates and to activate endothelial cells for leukocyte        adhesion reviewed in             With respect to osteoclast formation IFN is known to        potently inhibit RANKLmediated osteoclastogenesis in both        spleenderived macrophage cultures and bone marrow        coculture systems       It has also been        demonstrated that mice defective in IFN signaling have a        more rapid onset of arthritis and bone resorption compared        with wildtype mice suggesting a protective role of IFN        in early arthritis             There are situations however in which the        antiosteoclastogenic effects of IFN are not so clear        While IFN is not highly expressed in joints of patients        with rheumatoid arthritis diseases such as erosive        tuberculoid leprosy     and psoriatic arthritis           are associated with high Th cytokines such as IFN            In these conditions tissue destruction has been shown        to correlate with Thmediated immune responses and the        production of IFN indicating that osteoclastogenesis may        occur in the presence of elevated IFN            Furthermore several clinical studies have failed to        demonstrate efficacy of IFN administration as an        antiosteoclastogenic agent to prevent bone loss              There seem to be situations in which IFN does not act        as an antiosteoclastogenic agent In particular IFN has        been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of        osteoporosis in humans            In the present study we demonstrate that early exposure        to RANKL renders osteoclast precursors resistant to the        effects of IFN including inhibition of        osteoclastogenesis These effects were irreversible and not        caused by inhibition of proximal signaling at the level of        STAT or TRAF suggesting that resistance to IFN is        caused by a complex differentiation program specifying the        osteoclast fate These data may help explain the        contradictory findings regarding the effects of IFN as an        inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis and also suggest a model        of erosive disease in the presence of IFN whereby        osteoclast precursors are exposed to RANKL before they        enter the IFNrich environment                    Materials and

Minneapolis USA          GSTmRANKL was generated as described later Human RANKL          was a gift from Immunex Seattle USA and was used to          verify the efficiency of GSTRANKL protein as verified by          splenic osteoclast induction                          Cell culture and animals          The RAW mouse macrophage cell line was obtained          from ATCC Manassas USA and grown in a humidified  CO                     environment at C Cultures were          maintained with DMEM RD Systems supplemented with           fetal bovine serum and  penicillinstreptomycin          RAW cell osteoclasts were generated by plating exactly           RAW cells per well in a well dish with  ngml          GSTRANKL or additional cytokines and culturing for           days In some cultures administration of IFN was          delayed to allow for an early effect of RANKL          Osteoclasts were large multinucleated cells and          expressed high levels of tartrateresistant acid

    sacrificed at  weeks and spleens aseptically removed          Splenocytes were mechanically dissociated by disruption          through steel mesh and red blood cells were lysed using          a hypotonic ammonium chloride solution  g ammonium          chloride  g potassium bicarbonate  g EDTA  l          sterile water for a  solution The remaining white          cells were plated in well

         were generated by further addition of  ngml GSTRANKL          and culturing for  days IFN  ngml was added on          various days in some cultures                          TRAP staining and quantitation          Cultures were stained with the osteoclastspecific          marker TRAP using a kit from Sigma St Louis USA In          osteoclast precursors RANKL induced increasing TRAP          expression until virtually  of mononuclear cells were          highly TRAPpositive Fusion and multinucleation          subsequently occurred in proportion to the magnitude of          the RANKL stimulus          Osteoclasts were counted using three equivalent          methods optimized for the extent of osteoclastogenesis          For extremely robust osteoclast cultures manual tracing          and digital quantitation of a photographed osteoclast          area was the best measure due to extensive fusion and          multinucleation between cells Fig  Less robust          cultures with  osteoclasts per well were more          accurately quantitated by counting individual osteoclasts          Fig  For cultures utilizing lower levels of RANKL          and low osteoclast numbers densitometric quantitation of          TRAP was a more sensitive measure of osteoclastogenesis          Fig d                          Purification of GSTRANKL          GSTRANKL was purified as described previously              Briefly a fragment of murine RANKL cDNA was cloned          inframe into the pGEXT vector Amersham Pharmacia          Piscataway USA and expressed in BL bacteria Amersham          Pharmacia induced with  mM IPTG Gibco for  hours          at C Bacteria were lysed and soluble proteins were          recovered using glutathioneagarose beads Amersham

GSTRANKL was verified by RAW cell          osteoclastogenesis and TRAP expression before          experimental use A dose of  ngml GSTRANKL had          equivalent bioactivity to  ngml eukaryotically          expressed human RANKL protein donated by Immunex                          NO measurement          NO production was measured by the Greiss reaction          Promega Madison USA which spectrophotometrically          detects nitrite a stable breakdown product of NO whose          accumulation reflects NO production RAW cells were          plated in well plates and were stimulated

using dilutions of sodium          nitrite and the absorbance was measured at  nm          Similar data were obtained from proteinnormalized data          to control for variation in cell number or          proliferation                          Western blotting          Cells were lysed with hypotonic lysis buffer with          protease inhibitors RocheBoehringer Mannheim          Indianapolis USA Thirty micrograms of cytoplasmic          lysates or  g nuclear lysates were loaded onto           SDSPAGE gels and immunoblotted using chemiluminescent          antibodies Short exposures of blots were also performed          to verify that signals shown did not result from blot          overexposure All antibodies were from Santa Cruz Santa          Cruz USA except antiactin which was purchased from          Sigma                          Flow cytometry          After red blood cell lysis a single cell suspension          was incubated with antimurine CD Pharmingen San          Diego USA to block Fc receptormediated antibody          binding Cells were then labeled with          phycoerythrinconjugated antiCDb antibodies          Pharmingen or fluoresceinconjugated RANKL a gift from          M Tondravi American Red Cross Rockville MD USA as          described previously     Data were acquired using a          FACScalibur instrument Beckton Dickenson Bedford MA          USA and were analyzed by Cellquest software version           Beckton Dickenson CDb expression followed a          normaltype distribution in all groups indicative of one          population and the mean fluorescent intensity was thus          the unit of measure RANK staining indicated two          populations and the relative size of the high RANK          expressing RANKhi population was thus expressed on a          percentage basis                            Results                  IFN potently and irreversibly inhibits          RANKLinduced osteoclastogenesis          To evaluate the effects of IFN on          osteoclastogenesis we utilized the mouse macrophage cell          line RAW RAW cells or splenic macrophages from          CBABL mice as osteoclast precursors These cells have          been demonstrated to recapitulate critical aspects of          osteoclast formation and activity including bone          resorption expression of calcitonin receptor          multinuclear fusion and TRAP expression               A dose of  ngml RANKL generated numerous large          multinucleated osteoclasts Lower doses induced the          osteoclastspecific marker TRAP in mononuclear cells but          generated substantially fewer osteoclasts Fig ab A          hour exposure to IFN was sufficient to potently and          irreversibly inhibit osteoclastogenesis in the presence          of maximal doses of RANKL Fig  The exposure also          induced a stellate cellular morphology consistent with          that of an activated macrophage Fig  The rapid and          irreversible effects of IFN on osteoclast inhibition          indicate a dominant effect of this cytokine over RANKL          via induction of monocyte differentiation toward the          activated macrophage fate as opposed to the osteoclast          fate when concomitantly administered                          RANKLpretreated RAW cells are resistant to the          antiosteoclastogenic effect of IFN          The different kinetics between IFNmediated          macrophage activation  hours and RANKLmedicated          osteoclastogenesis  days prompted us to investigate          the effects of IFN on RANKLpretreated cells Fig           Pretreatment of RAW cells with RANKL for  hours          rendered them resistant to IFN these mononuclear cells          formed multinuclear osteoclasts despite the presence of          maximally inhibitory doses of IFN  ngml          To characterize this RANKLmediated resistance to          IFN we performed a series of doseresponse and time          course experiments Pretreatment with lower doses of          RANKL was unable to overcome IFN inhibition indicating          that resistance to IFN required high levels of RANKL          pretreatment Fig ab The duration of RANKL          pretreatment was also important the longer the          pretreatment phase the greater the resistance to IFN          Fig c Together these data show that pretreatment          with RANKL increases resistance to IFNmediated          osteoclast inhibition in a dosedependent and          timedependent manner          The mechanism by which IFN and RANKL reciprocally          inhibit each other in preosteoclasts is independent of          TRAF and STAT signal transduction Since it is well          established that RANK signaling is mediated primarily          through TRAF    and that IFN signaling is mediated          primarily through STAT      we examined their          expression by western blot We failed to observe          significant degradation of TRAF after stimulation with          IFN or RANKL in shortterm or longterm cultures Fig          ab          Interestingly IFNinduced STAT phosphorylation and          nuclear translocation was retained in preosteoclasts          Fig c This result was confirmed by electrophoretic          mobility shift assays and the absence of detectable          amounts of the STAT antagonists SOCS and SOCS data          not shown These results show that late preosteoclasts          are capable of signaling via JAKSTAT and suggest that          signaling events distal to TRAF and STAT modulate the          resistance of these cells to IFN                          RANKL pretreatment inhibits IFNinduced          macrophage activation          We next investigated whether other IFN effects          besides osteoclast inhibition were blunted in          RANKLpretreated cells IFNinduced NO production in          macrophages was blunted in osteoclasts probably due to          specialization for bone resorption in the latter          differentiated cell Fig  Pretreatment with RANKL          inhibited IFNinduced NO production in a dosedependent          and timedependent manner Fig bc          To expand these findings we investigated the          regulation of the cell surface markers CDb and RANK in          response to induction by RANKL and IFN Fig  Both          markers were strongly upregulated by IFN Consistent          with our prior results concomitant treatment of IFN          and RANKL showed dominance of the IFN upregulation          while pretreatment with RANKL for  days showed impaired          upregulation These data support the hypothesis that          sensitivity to IFN decreases with increasing osteoclast          differentiation and that the mechanism by which RANKL and          IFN reciprocally inhibit each other in preosteoclasts          is mediating the irreversible commitment into the          osteoclast or activated macrophage lineages                            Discussion        The role of cellular immunity Th in inflammatory bone        loss such as that seen in osteomyelitis and erosive        arthritis remains unclear The resolution of this issue is        further clouded by the apparent contradictory findings that        IFN is an extremely potent antiosteoclastogenic factor           but it can be found at high levels in sites of        osteolysis     To reconcile this controversy we        performed a series of experiments aimed at understanding        how IFN could induce either bactericidal effects via        macrophage activation or osteoclastic bone resorption by        influencing the same progenitor cell in the same bone        environment        We demonstrate that preosteoclasts stimulated with        RANKL for  days are rendered resistant to the IFN        induced inhibition of osteoclastogenesis NO production        and upregulation of CDb and RANK surface expression        Surprisingly this resistance is not mediated by inhibition        of the JAKSTAT pathway as STAT phosphorylation nuclear        translocation and DNAbinding capabilities are all        preserved in the late preosteoclast Together this        evidence suggests that RANKL modifies IFN effects        downstream of STAT        The present results predict that timing of IFN        exposure will be an important determinant of its biological        function during         in vivo osteoclastogenesis In the        case of circulating or peripheral macrophages that have not        encountered osteoclastogenic quantities of RANKL IFN        rapidly induces macrophage activation and subsequent NO        production recruiting these cells for immune responses        The dominance of IFN over RANKL which we observed         in vitro  ng IFN counteracts         ng RANKL when simultaneously administered probably allows        this macrophage activation to occur even in the presence of        RANKL expressed on circulating activated T cells             In the bone microenvironment however more abundant        RANKL produced by osteoblastsstromal cells may influence        certain monocytes to commit to the osteoclast lineage                    The present results predict that IFN will not activate        these cells as they have received an early RANKL signal        The strength of the early RANKL signal may be altered in        the setting of inflammatory bone diseases such as        rheumatoid arthritis in which high levels of RANKL        expressed on either synovial cells or infiltrating T cells            may induce osteoclast formation despite the        presence of exogenous or endogenous IFN        The potency of IFN as a macrophage activator and        osteoclast inhibitor suggests a prominent role for T cells        andor NK cells in the regulation of bone resorption as        these cells constitute the major source of IFN     A        link between activated T cells and osteoclast inhibition by        IFN has been highlighted in a report by Takayanagi         et al  providing the first         in vivo evidence that the immune        system may influence osteoclastogenesis            Interestingly other groups have demonstrated that        activated T cells induce osteoclastogenesis via        upregulation of surface RANKL presenting a dilemma        regarding the role of activated T cells in        osteoclastogenesis              It is possible that RANKL and IFN expression by        activated T cells may be a major mechanism by which T cells        control the fate of osteoclasts and that relative        expression of both molecules will dictate whether        osteoclasts are induced or inhibited The present results        suggest that the influence of activated T cells on        osteoclasts will probably change depending on when and        where the T cells encounter the osteoclasts Boneresident        macrophages preexposed to RANKL in the stromal environment        may be resistant to the immunoregulatory effects of IFN        and may thus be better suited for boneremodeling tasks In        contrast peripheral blood macrophages not exposed to RANKL        may be more responsive to the macrophageactivating        immunoregulatory effects of IFN and may thus be better        suited for antimicrobial activities        The molecular mechanisms underlying the contrasting        effects of IFN and RANKL remain elusive Based on the        phenotype of knockout mice it has become clear that TRAF        is the critical adapter molecule required for RANK        signaling during osteoclastogenesis     The importance        of TRAF has been further explored in deletion studies        which correlated its various domains with its        osteoclastogenic potential     A link between IFN        and RANK signaling via TRAF has also been demonstrated in        bone marrow cultures in which IFN was shown to        accelerate the degradation of TRAF     In our        studies however we failed to observe this TRAF        degradation as its expression remained constant in both        shortterm and longterm cultures under conditions where        IFN completely inhibited osteoclastogenesis While this        discrepancy could be explained by the possibility that RAW        cells represent a stage of preosteoclast differentiation        that is not sensitive to IFNmediated TRAF degradation        the present studies clearly indicate that IFN can inhibit        osteoclastogenesis via a completely different        mechanism        The retention of JakSTAT signaling in RANKLstimulated        preosteoclasts is intriguing given their demonstrated        insensitivity to IFN Since it is known that osteoclasts        express IFN receptors      it begs the question as        to why this pathway remains operant One possibility is        that IFNinduced STAT activation in osteoclasts leads to        the expression of a unique set of genes that is distinct        from that in macrophages Future studies designed to        understand IFN signaling in mature osteoclasts are needed        to resolve this issue        It is noteworthy to point out that the        dominantirreversible inhibitory effects of IFN on        osteoclastogenesis are fundamentally different to the        transientreversible inhibitory effects of IL on this        process which are mediated by STAT inhibition of NFB        activation      In the present article we        demonstrate that RANKLinduced osteoclastogenesis cannot be        recovered following exposure to IFN In contrast Wei         et al  have demonstrated that        preosteoclasts do not lose their potential to        differentiate into mature osteoclasts following a similar        exposure to IL     It thus appears that IFN        antiosteoclast activity is mediated by inducing terminal        differentiation away from the osteoclast lineage while        IL directly interferes with RANKL signaling during        osteoclastogenesis Collectively these findings are        consistent with the observations that Th cells are        associated with erosive disease       that IFN        does not have antiresorptive activity       and        that IL inhibits bone resorption              The present results underscore the importance of        developing a complete understanding of osteoclastogenesis         in vivo with regard to location        time and the signal transduction pathways involved It is        probable that signals such as IFN will be interpreted        differently by precursors at various stages of development        with consequent effects on disease Future studies in this        area are needed to better understand how T cells producing        both IFN and RANKL mediate immunity and bone resorption        and to better elucidate their role in the pathogenesis of        diseases such as osteomyelitis and erosive arthritis                    Conclusion        We have demonstrated using         in vitro methods that osteoclast        precursors exposed to RANKL for  days can be rendered        resistant to maximal osteoclastinhibitory doses of IFN        These IFNresistant preosteoclasts produced low levels        of NO upon IFN stimulation and were resistant to        IFNinduced Macinduced and RANKLinduced surface        expression suggesting a broad resistance to the cellular        effects of IFN The JakStat pathway was intact in these        cells indicating that downstream transcriptional events        are involved in the inhibition These results imply a model        for arthritic joints in which macrophage precursors        entering an inflamed joint are exposed to RANKL and are        subsequently rendered resistant to the        antiosteoclastogenic effects of IFN expressed by        activated T cells in the synovium
