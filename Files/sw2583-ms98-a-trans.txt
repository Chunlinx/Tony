        the uh public school system system seems to be getting a lot of uh criticism lately i guess over the years its always seemed worse uh to the parents that have kids in there than it was when they were there so uh i dont know how much of it is well a lot of it is deserved but then a lot of its not i mean the the kids are coming out learning uh things a lot faster uh whether or not they actually have it learned that that that yet uh remains to be seen at least in our kids case its theyre still in it but uh i know theyre learning things that uh   umhum   we never learned plus they have the burden of uh well this is the burden they have the task of learning computers uh even in uh kindergarten they had uh a requirements that they had to meet for learning the uh terms like keyboard and monitor and they wanted know what a computer was and what a disk was and   oh really thats great   you know all the uh yeah it is but its interesting that that theres that much more knowledge to be learned at this at this uh age you know not just the colors and begin on the alphabet its   so much more complex yeah   learn your colors learn your alphabet learn all your your little terms here and and learn how to uh begin learning some of the reading and by the second or third grade uh the little school system that were in they have uh really a lot of computers uh its a very wealthy district as as all that fightings going on over who gets the money and the like but they have   great yeah ive been hearing about that   they have uh twenty seven computers for each of the little labs and each lab serves uh two grades so the first and second graders have their own batch of computers that theyve cycled the kids through and   goodness   and so theres uh well i guess three or four different labs and theyre all very nice uh computers all tied together on the LAN and one server that handles all the software so that the teachers dont have to go around to each machine and do their work they can control it from the machine the server its its a beautiful system but uh the only bad thing it seems to do is uh not the computer necessarily but the company the school system seems to put a little bit more pressure on the kids than uh than we had of course of course i guess with that learning comes that pressure   umhum   we also managed to land in a school that uh they decided to build one big rectangular building and then not have any walls for the classroom and so it gets a little noisy its a little hard to keep the kids that quiet from one class to the next and they cant really   oh   be rowdy at any one given time so they they put them outside a lot they try you know to get a lot of good breaks here and there and but uh they just took bookcases and things to move around and sort of what you know sort of build a an idea of a wall and the kids seem to handle it okay but its its got some drawbacks to it and uh as if that wasnt bad enough they they also experimented with a particular size school most of the elementary schools were uh seven hundred uh kids in in it only goes from kindergarten up to fifth grade for our elementaries and our particular schools run uh thousand fifty right now   oh goodness   so they they put a few more warm bodies in there than the teachers really needed to have they still have a twenty three to twenty five or so to one teacher ratio but its still   that can be a disadvantage to the kids   yeah still a lot of people and you just cant get them in and out of the school in a reasonable length of time you know traffic is a bit of a problem  i mean of all the decisions they could have made on this particular school they uh they located it in a up against a creek and theres no street access to it except for one turn around driveway and that feeds onto a street that is right across the street from   oh no   another school  and they all get out at the same time and its just uh so we we spend a little time getting i get   get it   go over there to pick up uh my son about two thirty and he gets out at two forty five and that gives me a little bit of time to get parked and then i wait for between between kids rather than drive all the way home i wait a little while and and at two thirty i mean at three thirty my daughter gets out and we usually let them play if the weathers nice play outside until the traffic dies down and then we go home so im there from two thirty until four oclock im just waiting for   oh thats a good idea   to pick up the kids thats how much of a chunk it takes out of the old day but uh it is better just to let them you know play outside than it is to fight the traffic so and theres its real nice park lands on both sides of the school they have you know climbers and stuff like that but   well great   the the school system in and of itself as far as what theyre teaching um they cannot keep up with the private as far as because of the ratio theres just no way plus the private tends to have   umhum   the more disciplined kids you know theyre not dealing with the whole gamut of personalities here theyre theyre private schools do not put up with a child that is uh that much of a problem like most schools have to   thats right   so you have that kind of a situation but uh by the same token you have kids coming out of private schools that theyve spent very much time with them not able to social cope socially with the other types of people in the world   yeah um i remember i mean during my i went to a private school during the junior junior high years which was uh you know really during the development development time of my life and it was a small school we had like maybe twenty people in junior high i mean in my class like in seventh grade we had twenty in them and whenever we moved up to the eighth eighth grade we had like twenty or twenty five in the whole eighth grade and we had two different classes so the ratio was real good um as far as the we had real good teachers and i learned a lot i feel like that if i had of gone to a private school during junior high i probably wouldnt have developed such good study skills because um i thought the private school was difficult i mean it gave a lot of homework and everything and it really helped me develop my skills my uh my memorization i can memorize things real well now and things like that but and then whenever i got to high school it was kind of a disadvantage to me to to the fact that i was going from a class of twenty to a class of five hundred and uh and i do feel like that i was socially withdrawn to a certain extent because i didnt know anyone   uhhuh   and i was a freshman in high school you know and i was the peon but uh it probably took i dont know maybe the first semester to get to get to where i was really comfortable with school because um i hadnt been in the public school system for so long and it is just its really different it uh the children there are a lot a lot wilder than what i was used to i was grew i grew up in a very protective home and then whenever i got to high school things were just so much different especially nowadays i mean even the high school that i went to just recently they put up these little metal detectors at each door when you walk in to make sure you dont have a gun and things like that and uh   uhhuh     i mean its its gotten worse i graduated about two years ago and even in the past two years its gotten i mean its just increased the the crime and the the drugs and the violence and everything have just crime increased enormously   uhhuh   so um   well another thing that weve noticed thats uh changed over the years and uh were not really sure exactly what were going what we want to do with it publicly but uh the teachings uh the ideas that are taught uh dont always agree with what we would teach them either from a standpoint of morals or from a standpoint of how to handle a given situation   umhum   and there seems to be a a large degree of violence not necessarily taught but but ingrained in a majority of the kids either from TV or from uh quite a few kids like in the second to third grade take uh karate lessons and take various uh selfdefense things and its its its given to them or its proposed   golly   it seems to be socially acceptable as a selfesteem you know building building the persons confidence up and you have   umhum   uh third and fourth graders that are uh you know when they get into a fight they they tend to use some of the the maneuvers that they have and they feel a little more confident about their fighting ability they tend to get into a few more fights and several of them have ended with uh police calls and and having uh broken bones down at that level of   oh goodness   of kids i know more than one kid that has has got a uh record already just because of fighting of that that nature   oh no   and  its its not something that necessarily happens at school but just in their their uh relationships as they after school times and the like   umhum   and then you get into the whole area of of uh well what what i would deem the new age thinking where they have these little extra classes but they offer to come in about fifteen to twenty minutes early in the mornings and all the kids will sit around in a little circle and theyre theyre asked to empty their minds and to to think about uh they have a name of a particular dinosaur that they theyre to uh think about that dinosaur and theyre encouraged
