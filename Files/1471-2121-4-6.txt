                    Background        Subcellular localization of mRNAs represents a        fundamental mechanism for posttranscriptional control of        cell and tissue function Examples include the polarized        localization of oocyte mRNAs which is crucial for the        establishment axis formation in the embryo       the        targeting of specific mRNAs to the synapses of nerve cells             centrosomal segregation of mRNAs in the mollusk        embryo which results in asymmetric inheritance    and        the localization of actin mRNA to sites of active actin        polymerization at the leading edge of motile fibroblasts             In each of these cases mRNA targeting is mediated        by the cytoskeleton For example growth factorinduced        localization of actin mRNA to the leading edge of        fibroblasts is a dynamic regulated process requiring        actomyosin interactions and activation of the RhoGTPase        pathway as well as specific signal sequences in the  UTR        of the message        Moreover disruption of the        actin cytoskeleton using pharmacological agents also blocks        the association of actin mRNA with microfilaments and        prevents localization of the transcript to the cell        periphery      Mechanical forces exerted on cell        surface integrin receptors which anchor the actin        cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix also produce        changes in the localization of polyA mRNA and ribosomal        proteins inside the cell     Importantly the        localization of transcripts can serve as a key regulatory        step in gene expression as inhibition of mRNA targeting can        significantly impact cell function For example replacing        the  UTR of the mRNA for the intermediate filament        protein vimentin with the actin UTR sequence results        in mislocalization of vimentin transcript altered        fibroblast morphology and impaired motility            To date only a relatively small number of gene        transcripts are known to target to the cytoskeleton and all        of these have been found empirically         In situ hybridization technologies        and microinjection of fluorescently labeled RNAs have        greatly enhanced our ability to observe intracellular RNA        localization with high spatial resolution However the        number of RNA species that may be simultaneously observed        using these approaches is usually limited to only one        transcript at a time We hypothesized that association of        mRNAs with the cytoskeleton may be a more widespread        posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism that extends to a        larger subset of transcripts than is currently recognized        To explore this possibility we used gene microarray        technology to identify and analyze large populations of        cytosolic and cytoskeletonassociated mRNAs isolated from        HL promyelocytic cells By combining traditional        biochemical subcellular fractionation methods with        massivelyparallel gene profiling technology we were able        to ask the question how many different eukaryotic mRNAs        interact with the cytoskeletal network and what is their        identity                    Results        To investigate whether multiple mRNAs associate with the        cytoskeleton exponentially growing HL promyelocytic        cells were biochemically extracted to obtain fractions        enriched for either cytoskeleton or cytosolic components        Briefly cells were harvested and lysed in nonionic        detergent to release the soluble cytosolic fraction Upon        centrifugation the pellet containing cellular matrix was        resuspended in high salt buffer to release        cytoskeletonassociated components RNA was isolated from        both fractions and hybridized to nylon filter DNA arrays        that contained  gene or EST sequences After filtering        out genes whose signal intensity was not significantly        above background noise  known genes remained Analysis        of these genes revealed a subset of transcripts that were        enriched  fold in the cytoskeleton fraction relative to        the cytosolic fraction Table  top Selected transcripts        identified by microarray analysis including actin        spectrin and phosphatidylinositolkinase PIK were        subsequently confirmed by semiquantitative RTPCR Fig                Among the subset of transcripts that were found to be        enriched in the cytoskeleton fraction were several mRNA        species such as those encoding actin mRNA and ribosomal        protein subunits that have previously been shown to be        cytoskeletonassociated in other cell types      In        addition we identified approximately  new members of the        cytoskeletonassociated transcriptome the majority of        which encode structural proteins known to interact directly        with cytoskeleton filaments such as spectrin and protein         Table  Spectrin is an integral component of the        submembranous cytoskeleton that is required for maintenance        of cell shape and mechanical stability of the surface        membrane Interactions between spectrin and actin filaments        are stabilized by protein  and regulated by a variety of        accessory proteins     Protein  also may connect        the protein translation apparatus to the cytoskeleton        through interactions with a component of the eukaryotic        translation initiation factor complex eIFp            Interestingly mRNAs for multiple proteins involved in        translation such as various ribosomal proteins were        enriched in the cytoskeleton fraction Table I Other        transcripts found to be cytoskeletonassociated in this        study encode PIK which associates with the cytoskeleton        backbone of the focal adhesion    as well as thymosin         an actin monomer sequestering protein that also        contributes to control of cell motility and contractility                   To determine which specific class of cytoskeleton        filaments is required for the localization of these mRNAs        cells were treated with latrunculin B  gml for         min Latrunculin B depolymerizes actin microfilaments and        hence should release components that normally associate        with the actin cytoskeleton Western blotting of the        biochemical fractions prior to RNA isolation confirmed that        latrunculin B treatment resulted in a dramatic decrease in        the amount of actin protein that was extracted in the        cytoskeleton fraction RTPCR of RNA isolated from these        samples revealed a shift of the cytoskeletonassociated        transcripts to the cytosolic fraction upon exposure to        latrunculin indicating that these transcripts had been        associated with the actin cytoskeleton in intact cells Fig         In contrast depolymerizing microtubules with        nocodazole did not change the distribution of these        transcripts between the cytosolic and cytoskeleton        fractions data not shown        HL promyelocytic leukemia cells have been widely used        as a model system for the study of hematopoietic        differentiation because they undergo terminal        differentiation to one of several cell types of the        myelomonocytic lineage when stimulated with various        pharmacological agents     In particular induction of        macrophage differentiation by treatment of HL cells with        TPA is accompanied by dramatic alterations in cell        morphology and cytoskeleton structure Precursor HL        cells are spherical and grow in suspension whereas the        differentiated macrophagelike cells become adherent and        spread To examine whether differentiation and        reorganization of the cytoskeleton produces changes in mRNA        distribution macrophage differentiation was induced by the        addition of  nM TPA to suspension cultures of        exponentially proliferating HL promyelocytic cells        Within  hrs of induction the previously nonadherent        cells Fig A attached and spread on the tissue culture        plastic Fig B The serial extraction approach described        above was used to separate cytosolic and cytoskeleton mRNA        fractions from these adherent cells Spatial distribution        profiles of mRNAs in differentiated HL cells were        obtained using microarrays and compared with profiles of        the spherical precursor HL cells        Rather than comparing the entire transcriptome of        undifferentiated versus differentiated cells as is commonly        done     we were interested in how the two        transcriptome compartments behaved upon differentiation and        adhesion We found that the terminally differentiated cells        contained a greater number of cytoskeletonassociated        transcripts than suspended precursor cells consistent with        the idea that the cytoskeleton plays a larger role in        organizing RNAs in adherent cells Table bottom versus        top and Fig  Approximately  unique mRNAs exhibited        fold or more enrichment in the cytoskeletonassociated        samples A scatterplot of the ratios of cytoskeleton to        cytosolic RNAs in the precursor and macrophage cells        revealed a shift in the distribution of individual        transcripts to the cytoskeletal compartment upon        differentiation Fig  However the majority of        transcripts did not change their localization status as        indicated by the fact that the ratios of most genes        remained close to the diagonal in this plot        To further characterize changes in the overall        distribution pattern of mRNAs upon differentiation we        performed hierarchical cluster analysis of the four        different RNA profiles representing the two spatial pools        cytosolic and cytoskeleton in the two cell types        undifferentiated and differentiated cells Complete        linkage clustering based on Euclidean distance    of        these four sets of transcripts cytosolic versus        cytoskeleton transcripts in HL cells in the presence or        absence of TPA revealed that the cytoskeletonanchored        population in the precursor HL cells and those in the        macrophage cells were most similar Fig  In other        words mRNAs within each distinct subcellular compartment        clustered more closely together than those of the same cell        type Thus the overall subcellular distribution of mRNAs        is largely conserved across the two different cell types        despite significant changes in cytoskeleton architecture        adhesive state and cell morphology                    Discussion        Interactions between mRNA and cytoskeleton filaments are        responsible for the spatial distribution and localized        function of several transcripts in somatic cells              However since only a small number of localized mRNAs        have previously been uncovered it is not known to what        extent the association of RNAs with the cytoskeleton might        be a more general mechanism of gene regulation Our data        suggest that while many mRNAs distribute equally between        the cytosolic and cytoskeletal fractions a specific set of        transcripts associates preferentially with actin        microfilaments        Furthermore this spatial distribution pattern was        retained even after the round HL cells were chemically        induced to differentiate into macrophages that adhere and        spread on the culture substrate a process that involves        extensive alterations in cytoskeletal architecture and        genomewide changes in gene expression Thus the        cytoskeletonassociated transcripts may encode a core group        of proteins whose expression may be regulated at the        posttranscriptional level through their association with        the components of the actin cytoskeleton network        Consistent with this hypothesis the majority of        cytoskeletonassociated transcripts identified in this        study encoded proteins that modulate cytoskeleton structure        or adhesion Spectrin and protein  form a complex with        actin filaments     that may be important in        signaling in additional to forming a physical link between        the cytoskeletal network and the cell membrane            Furthermore PIK activity has been shown to associate with        the actin cytoskeleton by biochemical detergent extraction           and is thought to specifically localize with         integrin     PIK catalyzes the production of        phosphatidylinositolphosphate an intermediate in        multiple phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways which        itself can interact with actin binding proteins to regulate        microfilament polymerization     Our work now suggests        that the mRNAs of these proteins are all positioned in        close association with the actin cytoskeleton to permit        efficient localization of their protein products        Given the limited sensitivity of DNA arrays it is        possible that the cytoskeleton may play a role in the        localization and regulation of additional cellular        transcripts that could not be detected with the approach        described here Abundant mRNA species may target only a        miniscule fraction of mRNA molecules to the cytoskeleton        this may be the functionally important fraction but its        relevance would not be revealed using this method On the        other hand mRNAs of lowly expressed genes may be entirely        associated with the cytoskeleton but may fall below the        limits of microarray detection For the majority of gene        transcripts the relationship between mRNA localization and        translational activation remains unclear It is therefore        possible that although only a small fraction of a        particular transcript associates with the cytoskeleton        these localized molecules might actually represent the        actively translated subpopulation        This naturally raises the question of whether the        cytoskeletonassociated transcripts are differentially        expressed in promyelocyte and macrophage cells Tamayo         et al have previously monitored gene        expression at various time points following phorbol        esterinduced differentiation in the same HL cell system            Thirteen of the  transcripts we identified as        cytoskeletonassociated were also assayed in that study by        Tamayo         et al     Only two of these        transcriptsalpha spectrin and pim were found to vary        significantly in that the expression of both genes was        undetectable in the promyelocytic cell type and increased        dramatically upon differentiation to the macrophage cell        type Future work in this area might address the potential        relationship between cytoskeletonlocalization and        expression of these transcripts        As a mechanosensitive scaffold that controls a large set        of regulatory proteins the actin cytoskeleton is        critically poised to modulate a variety of cellular        processes including protein synthesis cell survival        migration and proliferation       One function of        the cytoskeleton in gene regulation appears to be the        spatial organization of transcripts and possibly their        translation within the intracellular environment Our work        demonstrates that a subset of gene transcripts interacts        with the actin cytoskeleton and that this subpopulation        includes a number of structural and cytoskeletonmodulating        proteins as well as molecules involved in protein        translation This finding is consistent with the hypothesis        that cellular evolution resulted from selfassembly of        molecular scaffolds like the actin cytoskeleton that        provide simultaneous structural and biochemical functions        including orienting mRNA transcripts and facilitating their        translation into proteins that selfassemble into the very        scaffolds to which they associate            In summary this work extends our view of        posttranscriptional control of gene expression by        revealing that multiple transcripts involved in cellular        regulation associate with the actin cytoskeleton The        subcellular localization of the majority of these        transcripts had not been previously investigated It        appears that information about the spatial context of an        mRNA species in addition to knowledge of its temporal        expression pattern may be necessary for a more complete        view of gene regulation Thus a combination of other        biochemical fractionation techniques eg isolation of        microtubule or intermediate filament cytoskeleton        compartments nuclear matrix etc with massively parallel        gene profiling technology may provide additional insights        into cellular regulation                    Conclusions        In this work we set out to explore the extent to which        somatic cell transcripts associate with the cytoskeleton        and to identify the specific transcripts that might be        regulated through cytoskeleton localization A set of         transcripts encoding structural proteins cytoskeletal        proteins and components of the translation machinery was        shown to be highly enriched in the cytoskeletonassociated        population of HL cells Intact actin microfilaments were        required for the localization andor anchoring of these        transcripts In addition this study emphasizes the value        of using subcellular fractionation to expand the range of        genomewide technologies by providing information about the        spatial distribution of a transcript in addition to its        expression level                    Methods                  Cell culture conditions          Suspended HL promyelocytic leukemia cells were          cultured in IMDM Clonetics supplemented with  fetal          bovine serum Hyclone Cells were

was determined by measuring          lactate dehydrogenase activity as a marker for release of          cytosol The detergent concentration that released           of the lactate dehydrogenase activity in the          cytosolic fraction was chosen for all subsequent studies          TPAtreated cells become adherent and were harvested at           hr by scraping in buffer A pelleting the
