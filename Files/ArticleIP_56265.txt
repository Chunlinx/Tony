                                  Regis Philbin            The hottest celebrity in America is a TV star withno discernible talent who is  years oldthats  in TV yearswhosepartner is the most detested woman on television and whose claims to fame arean evening game show that no one wins  Who Wants To Be a Millionaire and a morning talk show where nothing happens  Live With Regis  KathieLee  Yet Regis Philbin deserves all his acclaim and more            Regis has not come fromnowhere He has come from everywhere Until he hit big with Live in thelate s he was the quintessential loser a year alsoran A Notre Damegrad and Navy veteran he got his start in the early s hosting a talk showin San Diego Calif and spent the next quarter century anchoring shows in NewYork St Louis and Los Angeles Periodically these stints would beinterrupted by a shot at the big time which Regis would invariably blow In he succeeded Steve Allen as host of Westinghouses marquee latenightshow It flopped and Philbin was dumped for Merv Griffin In the late sPhilbin spent three years as Joey Bishops sidekick on another doomedlatenight show Johnny Carsons Tonight Show spanked Bishop in theratings In the mids Philbin bombed as host of a couple of game shows In he tanked as anchor of a national morning program No one could explainwhy Regis didnt work He was too spastic perhapsjust a nerve ending asBill Zehme who cowrote Philbins delightful autobiography puts it            Regis returned to New York in  took over a morningshow hooked up with Kathie Lee Gifford then Kathie Lee Johnson two yearslater and went national with the show in  Live has been a monsterhit ever since Regis and Kathie Lee quickly became figures of ridicule theembodiment of unhip He was the toothy moron she the unbearable croonerLive sounds like a joke an hour of nothing  minutes of host chatbetween Regis and Kathie Lee celebrity interviews lame stunts a triviaquestion Watch it once and it seems pathetic Watch it twice and you beginto see genius            As host of Liveor Millionaire  or anything else he has ever done Regis displays noevident talent He does not interview guests well He does not tell jokes Helacks empathy He displays no particular intelligence He speaks in a bizarrevoice equal parts Bronx sinus and helium            So why is he the most watchable person on television Inthe autobiography Im Only One Man  he explains his success this wayI started small and learned to keep it small Small is friendlier and morereal Small lasts longer This captures one of Regis gifts He has a modestbut captivating comic persona He is the master of umbrage Walloped by ageneration of rejection failure and sidekickdom he has perfected the personaof the aggrieved little guy His hyperactivity has mellowed but not too muchIn host chat his specialty Regis turns the mundane details of his lifealost wallet a urinarytract problem a disagreement with Live sproducerinto comic gems Most performers mask their insecurity with egoRegis shares his insecurity He can take offense at anything He is cottoncandy spinning TV sugar out of thin air            Kathie Lee endlessly chipper and extraperfectserves as superb foil for Regis peevishness He jabs her mocking her singingand her tedious stories about her son She punches right back It is anamusingly petty domestic drama enacted every morning at             Regis comic personareinforces his second gift a perfect relationship with the camera No onetalks to the screen better than Regis He is the last of the true broadcasterswho can go on the air and spout about nothing says Zehme He is never at aloss to speak to the camera as if it were you This is one reason why DavidLetterman Larry King and other TV celebs idolize Reege            Regis seems genuine on camera in part because hispersonality and TV persona have joined Profiles of Philbin are tedious becausehe has revealed everything on the show his latest squabble with his wifeetc There is no secret life of Regis Philbin While criticizingsensationalistic confessional talk shows he divulges everything abouthimself He just doesnt have anything salacious to tell            It is too bad that so many Americans are meetingRegis as the host of Millionaire click for a description of the gameThough Millionaire has brought ABC its first sweeps win since oh the th century the show does not do Regis justice He is a creatureof sunny day not shadowy night He is restrained on Millionaire forbidden to indulge in his stories adlibs and insults His job is to makethe contestants sweat but hes no good at it Hes too light to play theheavy The dark suits he wears make him look like a lounge singer not anenforcer His voice cannot convey menace His attempts to daunt contestants aremore genial than ominous although Is that your final answer has become anational catchphrase And Regis certainly doesnt exude the Olympian wisdomyoud expect from the host He often seems more surprised to learn the answerthan the contestants do            Even so Reege may be the ideal game show host forthis ironic age He allows the show to be both deadly serious and parodyMillionaire is portentously heavy yet run by a man with no gravitas Itconcerns itself with something that mattersa million bucksyet Regispresence makes it frivolous With a somber host Millionaire would beoppressive Thanks to Regis it is the perfect s experience You can enjoyit as challenge kitsch or both
