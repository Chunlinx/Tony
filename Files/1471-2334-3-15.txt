                    Background        The ability of         Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria        to infect and replicate inside host mononuclear phagocytes        is key to its ability to establish an infection and cause        tuberculosis To elucidate the mechanisms used by tubercle        bacilli to survive in macrophages researchers at several        laboratories are studying mycobacterial genes specifically        expressed during growth in macrophages                 Among the genes specifically expressed during intracellular        growth are genes encoding two extracytoplasmic function        sigma factors SigE  E and SigH  H       Sigma        factors play critical roles in the recognition of promoters        by RNA polymerase In several systems individual sigma        factors are known to regulate the differential expression        of sets of genes involved in specific processes such as        genes involved in the heatshock response or those required        for sporulation in         Bacillus subtilis             Identifying a differentially expressed sigma factor can        provide a means to identifying other differentially        expressed genes  genes whose expression are controlled by        the sigma factor To identify sigma factorregulated genes        we developed a method termed ITRAP for the         i dentification of         t ranscriptional         r egulator         a ctivated         p romoters ITRAP takes advantage        of the fact that some genes will be differentially        expressed in the presence and absence of a transcription        regulatory protein To identify transcription        factordependent promoters a genomic DNA library is        generated in a promotertrap plasmid containing two        reporter genes The library is transformed into strain        expressing the transcription factor and recipients with        plasmids containing an active promoter are selected by        virtue of expression of one of the reporter genes The        plasmids are recovered and transformed into a strain that        does not express the transcription factor Promoters        dependent on the expression of the regulator are        differentiated from other promoters by screening for lack        of reporter activity in bacteria not expressing the        regulatory protein To illustrate the development and use        of the ITRAP approach we describe here the construction        of the vectors host strains and library necessary to        identify  Eregulated genes of         M tuberculosis

The basic ITRAP approach Figure  uses a genomic          DNA library in a plasmid vector containing a promoterless          operon with two reporter genes One reporter gene the           aph gene which confers resistance          to kanamycin allows for selection of active promoters          and a second reporter gene the           xylE gene which encodes catechol           dioxygenase allows for screening for loss of          promoter activity In the first step of the ITRAP          approach the recombinant plasmid library is transformed          into bacteria expressing the transcriptional regulator          Transformants containing plasmids with active promoters          are isolated by selection on kanamycincontaining media          A subset of the active promoters will be those whose          expression depends on the transcriptional regulator To          differentiate between promoters dependent on the          regulator and other promoters plasmid DNA from a pool of          the kanamycinresistant transformants is transformed into          bacteria that do not express the transcriptional          regulator The hygromycin Bresistant transformants are          screened for XylE expression by spraying colonies with          catechol Yellow colonies arise from bacteria that          contain a plasmid with a transcriptionally active          promoter White colonies arise from bacteria that contain          a plasmid with a promoter that is inactive in the absence          of the transcriptional regulator          To develop the ITRAP method for

 plasmid library DNA was electroporated into           M smegmatis LRSEint          bacteria which constitutively express the           M tuberculosis sigE gene To          determine the proportion of active promoters in the          library a portion of the transformation mixture was          spread on medium containing hygromycin B all          recipients and a portion was spread on medium          containing kanamycin recipients with an active          promoter    hygromycin Bresistant colony          forming units CFUs ml and             kanamycinresistant CFUml were recovered therefore          approximately  of transformants contained an active          promoter fragment When the initial pool of          kanamycinresistant colonies sprayed with catechol the          colonies were light to dark yellow indicating a wide          range of XylE activity          To differentiate between  Edependent and          independent promoters approximately           kanamycinresistant transformants were pooled and          plasmid DNA was isolated and electroporated into           M smegmatis LR           sigE bacteria in which the wild          type copy of the           sigE gene had been disrupted with          the gentamicinresistance gene Transformants were plated          on hygromycin B and assayed for catechol  dioxygenase          activity by spraying colonies with  M catechol About           colonies were sprayed with catechol and a range          of color intensity from white to bright yellow was          observed A total of  white and light yellow colonies          were recovered Overall about  of hygromycin          Bresistant colonies were white or light yellow          To confirm the phenotypes of plasmids recovered in          this twostep procedure plasmids were recovered from           white colonies and individually transformed into           M smegmatis LRSEint          SigEexpressing and           M smegmatis LR           sigE bacteria All  plasmids          generated only white colonies when transformed into the           Emutant strain However although all  plasmids          generated yellow colonies when transformed into           Eexpressing bacteria some plasmids produced a mixture          of white and yellow colonies These white colonies were          consistently white on retesting and their plasmids          usually contained deletions that removed the cloned           M tuberculosis sequence Replating          of the yellow colonies produced a mixture of white and          yellow colonies suggesting that the expression of the           xylE or           aph gene in the SigEexpressing          strain may be detrimental to the cell and may lead to          plasmid instability          A preliminary analysis of the sequences of the inserts          in the  clones identified  inserts that had matches          with the SigE consensus sequence     Interestingly          none of these genes were identified as being SigEinduced          genes in microarray studies     although the          expression of one of the genes Rvc            sigH  is thought to be          SigEregulated                                Discussion        A key feature of the ITRAP method is that it allows two        degrees of promoter analysis ie with and without a        transcriptional regulator The first step allows selection        of all active promoters under one condition and the second        step sorts promoters by activity dependent on a second        condition In the study reported here we used this method        to identify potential  Einduced genes The basic ITRAP        approach might also be used to identify promoters repressed        by a particular protein The transformation steps are        reversed so that the promoters are selected in the mutant        background first ie no repressor and then screened for        loss of activity in the presence of the repressor        protein        The ITRAP method might also be used to characterize        promoter activity in two environmental conditions in a        manner similar to the IVET approach     This is useful        because in some cases the factor necessary for        transcriptional activation during a particular        environmental condition is unknown In this case after        exposing bacteria containing the recombinant library to an        environmental condition eg a heat shock or acid shock        or growth in medium A antibiotics could be added to the        medium to kill any bacteria that had not expressed the        antibiotic resistance reporter gene during the exposure        For mycobacteria a twohour treatment with kanamycin would        be sufficient to kill bacteria that had not expressed the        kanamycinresistance gene during the stress The resistant        bacteria would then be grown in a second medium or in the        absence of a stress and colonies scored for lack of        promoter activity in the second condition by expression of        the         xylE reporter gene White colonies        would contain a plasmid with a promoter that is active only        during the first condition Using ITRAP for this purpose        may provide a means to identify promoters dependent on any        of several regulatory proteins that may be active during        the stress and to obtain a global overview of gene        expression during the stress        In the ITRAP method the recipient strain can be the        native bacterium or a surrogate host We used         M smegmatis as the host because it        grows much more rapidly than does         M tuberculosis generation time of         hrs vs  hrs does not require BSL facilities and is        more easily manipulated genetically than         M tuberculosis  One possible        advantage of using a surrogate host is that studies could        be focused on one particular regulator which might avoid        complications due to other regulatory proteins in the cell        that may be able to recognize promoters in the library Of        course the surrogate host must not have a regulatory        protein that recognizes the same promoters as the regulator        being studied In our studies the         M smegmatis  Eprotein has         homology with the         M tuberculosis  Eprotein            While this suggests that the         M tuberculosis  Eprotein should be        able to interact properly with the         M smegmatis RNA polymerase it also        suggests that the         M smegmatis  Ehomolog might be able        to recognize         M tuberculosis  Edependent        promoters Because of this we constructed an         M smegmatis host strain that lacked        any functional  Eprotein        An assumption of the ITRAP approach is that the        sequences cloned in the plasmids will be recognized by        transcriptional regulatory proteins in the same manner as        the intact sequences in the genome The cloning process        might generate falsepositive or falsenegative results        because of the cloned sequences being recognized out of the        context of the surrounding genomic sequences        Another assumption of the ITRAP approach is that        overexpression of a transcriptional regulator will be        sufficient to induce gene expression from its regulated        promoters This suggests that proteins such as PhoP that        require activation to promote transcription may not be        approachable with this method unless the overexpressed        regulatory protein can also be activated Also certain        regulatory proteins may not be suitable for study in a        surrogate host bacterium     For proteins that require        the presence of additional factors such as  N or        interaction with host proteins to be active such as         Ewith RNA polymerase use of the native bacterium or        closely related surrogate host may be required to ensure        the presence of the necessary interacting proteins            Some of these additional factors however may only be        expressed or active under a particular growth condition and        therefore may also need to be conditionally expressed along        with the transcription factor Promoters that require both        a positive transcription regulator and the absence of a        repressor protein may be missed because expressing the        positive transcription factor alone may not be sufficient        to induce transcription at such promoters Another        limitation of the ITRAP method is that some transcription        factors may not be stably maintained in the bacterium or        may be lethal to the bacterium when overexpressed To        avoid this problem an inducible promoter could be used to        promote transcription of the gene encoding the        transcription factor        Another possible complication of this approach is that        expressing a foreign protein may turn on the stress        response of the host bacterium Transcription factors        mediating the stress response to the expressed foreign        protein may be able to recognize promoters within the        library and promote transcription of the reporter genes        thus producing the false positives in the twostep        screen        Because the first step of the ITRAP method involves        selection for active promoters one could easily begin with        a library containing recombinants representing all possible        promoters in a bacterial genome Unfortunately the        recombinant DNA library used in this study contained only         of the genome in the correct orientation upstream of        the reporter genes which will limit the number of        different promoters we can recover using this library For        the screening step we used the         xylE gene because catechol         dioxygenase activity is easily measured by spraying        colonies with catechol and the amount of color produced is        a rough measure of promoter activity     In our        screen white pale yellow and bright yellow colonies were        observed indicating a wide range of promoter activity        Pale yellow colonies may represent weak  Eindependent        promoters or promoters that are recognized by another sigma        factor in addition to  E providing a low level of        constitutive expression These possibilities could be        distinguished by transformation of plasmids from individual        clones into the  Eoverexpressing strain and directly        comparing of XylE activity in the presence and absence of         E Unfortunately it appears that expression of XylE in         M smegmatis may be detrimental and        may lead to plasmid instability and loss of the inserted        DNA This raises the possibility that some white colonies        may arise in the second step of ITRAP by loss of a        promoter fragment from a plasmid recovered in the first        step Nonetheless the ITRAP method should greatly enrich        for promoters with the desired activities As is generally        true for genetic screens it is essential to study any        identified promoters in their native state to understand        the regulation of their expression                    Conclusions        The ITRAP method is a versatile and useful method for        characterizing promoter activity under a variety of        conditions and in response to various regulatory proteins        In our study we isolated  clones that may contain        plasmids carrying SigEregulated promoters genes of         M tuberculosis  The analysis of        these clones will be reported elsewhere
