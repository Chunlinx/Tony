        okay national service what do you think about it im sorry i forgot i forgot your name already     Lee   Lee okay Lee   oh well i think ideally people should want to do that automatically and that they should want to do what you know meshes with how they feel and what theyre good at and they shouldnt be funneled into a mandatory sort of a thing   umhum umhum um well youre not going to get a whole lot of disagreement from me  none of the people that i talk to on this project disagree with me very much which kind of surprises me   oh well in that case i think what this country needs is a good mandatory program to uh       you know get people just thinking hey this is normal its normal to do good you know to be civic minded you know just so they wont you know everybody will just think   umhum um hum well think of how much we have to pay for it i mean im you know i think if its voluntary you get the people that want to be there   this is the way things are and it   theyll do well if its mandatory you get everybody you get people that dont want to dont want to do work like that and theyll goof off or or sell drugs to their coworkers or something like that um   well im not looking at the mandatory uh program as a cost effective way of getting this stuff done im looking at it as a way to shape peoples psyches into thinking that public service is a good thing   hum   of course the program would have to work or else theyll think yeah public service another boondoggle you know theyll be sitting there working on the job doing nothing   yeah im well think of it yeah yeah i i but i wonder about that the the mere fact that it isnt cost effective do you think that that if if its not cost effective do you think that people are going to be enthused about it   oh well certainly the people that do volunteer to do all sorts of things arent thinking cost effective   well youve got youve got a far fewer number what percentage of of of people do you think now do something like that um   well i think everything that people you know what do people do they polish their cars right why do they do it because they think theyre going to be saving lots of money on repainting and having the car last that much longer no because they want it to look really sharp   hum   not a cost effective thing you know they raise money to build a new church because they want to put eight zillion filigrees there because its cost effective or because they need the space   well i dont  if you need the space i suppose its cost effective because you cant get along with the old with with the old one but um  no i i and it just seems to me that that that once you get everybody involved theres theres what theres eight million is it uh uh kids college uh turning eighteen every year i think its about that might be a little bit lower now but uh thats an awful lot to to bring into a program you got to have eight million jobs available youve got to have administrators for eight million jobs that would be tremendously expensive not you know not to forget the cost of putting all of those kids in uh in in in non market uh enterprises enterprises for for for a couple of years uh thats going to delay their entry into the work force delay the time when they can begin paying taxes too so so the impact is going to be double there i um just dont see   well you have to define the purpose of the program you know is there excess labor and thats why youre doing this   no   i mean what theres sort of both excess excess bodies available to labor but then theres not enough skilled labor     i dont know i i think the   so at the same time you have too many people who want to work or too many people who could work and not enough people who can work   yeah uh i i grant to that but if thats the case then it neednt then then you dont have a mandatory you dont need a mandatory program to bring everybody into national service you just need a program for the people that havent gotten anything gotten anything better to do and i think that might be a good idea although again then you get the kind of people who are likely to sell drugs to their coworkers et cetera   well they did this in uh the depression they invented what the CCC   right   and uh they had a whole bunch of people go out west and dig ditches and plant trees and   thats true but but i think that was different uh in at least three respects first of all um it was not a mandatory program if you didnt have another job you could join it you were not required to but it was a way to get a paycheck so people did join it secondly the time of the depression was just vastly different people were not as cynical about society about government and about the nation as they are now um so they didnt react negatively as many people would today and thirdly the economic conditions were different it was a big drain on the Treasury during the depression as well its not clear that it made it any easier to get out of the depression
