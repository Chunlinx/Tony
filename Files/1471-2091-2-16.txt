                    Background        Scorpion venom is a rich source of various polypeptides        with diverse physiological and pharmacological activities        which generally exert their action via target specific        modulation of ion channel function       Among the        well characterized peptide toxins are those from the venom        of scorpions belonging to the family Buthidae Buthoid        venom has been reported to strongly affect a wide variety        of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms    and its        toxicity is attributed to the presence of a large variety        of basic polypeptides crosslinked by  disulfide bridges             Based on their molecular size and pharmacological        activity these toxins are classified into two main groups        The first group contains short toxins  amino acid        residues with  disulfide bridges which mainly affect        the voltage dependent K channels and the large conductance        calcium activated K channels      The second group        includes longchain  amino acids peptides cross        linked by  disulfide bridges which mainly have an effect        on voltage dependent sodium channels of excitable cells             According to their species selectivity sodium channel        toxins have been divided into mammalian and insect toxins        Furthermore depending on their binding affinities and        electrophysiological properties the mammalian toxins are        subclassified into  and  toxins      and the        insectspecific toxins are subdivided into excitatory        depressant and  insect toxins     Several toxins        which specifically affect sodium and potassium channels        have been extensively studied with respect to their        structure mode of action and pharmacological properties              In addition to the two main groups of toxins        several other toxins targeted toward Ca     and Cl            channels have also been isolated during the past        decade        Owing to their species selectivity increasing attention        has been paid in recent years to identify insectselective        toxins that can be used to develop recombinant        biopesticides as a safer alternative to broad spectrum        chemical insecticides       Several        insectselective toxins have been identified and purified        from scorpions collected in different geographical        locations          However the Indian red        scorpion         Mesobuthus tamulus known for its        severe toxicity     received little attention in this        regard The few studies documented on         Buthus tamulus are restricted to the        isolation and purification of neurotoxins protease        inhibitors histamine releasers    iberiotoxin an        inhibitor of high conductance Ca activated K channel           and neurotoxin BtII     In the quest for natural        insectselective toxins we have identified a novel short        lepidopteranselective toxin from the venom of         Mesobuthus tamulus having  amino        acids residues and  halfcystines We named it as ButaIT                 B tamulus insect toxin which has        high sequence homology with a few short toxins                 and shows high selectivity to a lepidopteran        insect         Heliothis virescens This paper        describes isolation purification and sequence        determination of this toxin                    Results and Discussion                  Bioassay driven purification of ButaIT          The CM cation exchange column yielded  peaks at           nm Fig  When CM fractions were tested for          lethality on mice only CMfraction III and crude venom          were found to be toxic at a dose of  gg body weight          Among all the CM fractions CM fraction IV accounted for          almost all of the lethality to tobacco budworm Hence          further studies were conducted using only CM fraction IV          Fractionation of CMIV yielded  peaks using ionpair          reversed phase HPLC Fig  Bioassay of the individual          HPLC fractions of CMIV fraction on tobacco budworm          blowfly larvae and mice led to the localization of          lepidopteran selective toxicity in CMIV fraction           Table  Administration of CMIV HPLC fractions to          tobacco budworm at a dose of  g mg larva showed          slow and progressive flaccid paralysis only with fraction           Other fractions were ineffective at this dose Hence          fraction  CMIV was collected lyophilized and          resolved further using HPLC gradient systemII which          yielded two peaks CMIVA and CMIVB Among the two          fraction CMIVA was found to induce progressive          irreversible flaccid paralysis at the dose of  g mg          per larva of           Heliothis virescens Neither of          these fractions induced any significant toxic symptoms in          blowfly larvae or mice This fraction was further          purified to apparent homogeneity by microbore HPLC and          the purity was confirmed by capillary electrophoresis          Fig  This fraction is estimated to account for           of the total protein content of the dry venom                          Structural analysis          The molecular mass of the peptide toxin determined by          ESIMS was Da Fig  which is in agreement with          the molecular mass calculated from the amino acid          sequence when the toxin is in its native form with four          disulfide bridges as observed in other similar toxins An          examination of multiple sequence alignment with known          insect toxins using BLAST search    revealed that          ButaIT toxin shows considerable homology Fig  with          short insect toxins and shows highest percentage          identity with peptide I  and LQH  followed          by neurotoxin P  chlorotoxin  insectotoxin          IA  insect toxin I  and insectotoxin II                              Toxins of buthid venoms constitute a family of closely          related peptides which could be classified into several          structurally related peptides depending on their amino          acid     Although the information available on the          mode of action of these toxins is limited it appears          that different short toxins exhibit considerable          diversity in their physiological mechanisms in spite of          their structural homology For example Fazal           et al     reported that          peptide I is related to neurophysin agglutinins              and other peptides of the fourdisulfide core family          with toxinagglutinin fold The neurotoxin P  ammo          acids another short toxin and a structural homologue of          short insectotoxin II and  shows toxicity towards           Sarcophaga falculata and          crustaceans     Chlorotoxin isolated from           Leiurus quinquestriatus          haebraeus shows Cl channelblocking activity and          causes paralysis due to the inhibition of structurally          related anion channels such as the extrajunctional          channels of arthropod muscles     It has also been          reported that the short insectotoxin IA may act on a          glutamate receptor of the postsynaptic membrane              Although no specific experimental evidence is available          on the mode of action of ButaIT it is assumed that          ButaIT exerts similar ion channel blocking activity as          that of other short insect toxins However a detailed          physiological and pharmacological analysis is necessary          to define the exact mechanism of ButaIT in spite of its          high sequence and structural homology with other insect          toxins          Considering the high degree of sequence similarity it          is presumed that ButaIT will have a similar D structure          to that of other short toxins The D structures of          several short toxins such as charybdotoxin ChTX              iberiotoxin IbTx     kaliotoxin KxTx              margatoxin MgTx     maurotoxin     agitoxin          AgTx     noxiustoxin NTX     PiL              insectotoxin IA     LQH    and chlorotoxin             have been determined by NMR spectroscopy and Xray          crystallography A structure model of ButaIT generated          from the Swissmodel protein modeling server based on the          structural coordinates of chlorotoxin    and          insectotoxin IA    showed that ButaIT adopts a          typical core structure of scorpion toxins primarily          composed of one helix and three strands with four          disulfide bridges a feature similar to other toxins of          similar size that act on K and Cl channels                 It is also evident from the data that disulfide          bridge formation in ButaIT likely follows a common motif          with covalent links between cyslcys cyscys          cyscys and an additional disulfide bridge between          cys and cys  which crosslinks the Nterminal strand          of the sheet to the helix Experiments are underway          to purify larger quantities of ButaIT using baculovirus          expression system in order to establish a refined          structurefunction relationship                            Conclusions        Here we report the isolation of a short insecticidal        toxin from the venom of         Mesobuthus tamulus The most        important characteristic of this novel toxin is its        specificity towards         Heliothis virescens the tobacco        budworm a worldwide pest of numerous valuable crops such        as cotton When expressed in baculovirus system as a        biopesticide scorpion toxins offer the advantage of faster        kill without chemical insecticides     Although the        safety of recombinant baculoviruses is less of a concern        ButaIT offers an extra level of safety as a recombinant        biopesticide due to its specificity to tobacco budworm ion        channels Moreover this toxin can be utilized as a specific        probe of tobacco budworm ion channels Chemical libraries        can be screened for the ability to displace ButaIT leading        to the discovery of better pesticides                    Materials and Methods                  Toxin purification          The crude venom of           Mesobuthus tamulus was purchased          from Haffkine Institute Bombay India Lyophilized          venom  mg was homogenized in  ml of  mM ammonium          acetate

acid TFA The          individual proteins were eluted from the column with a          linear gradient reaching  Solvent B B           acetonitrile  TFA in  min at a flow rate of           mlmin Gradient systemI All the fractions were          collected freeze dried and assayed for biological          activity The active fractions were further purified          using a Protein C Column Vydac

acetonitrile  HFBA reaching  in  min at a          flow rate of  mlmin Gradient systemII Individual          peaks were collected lyophilized and used for bioassays          The protein concentrations of the samples were determined          using the BCA protein assay Pierce with bovine serum          albumin as the standard Following two HPLC steps the          toxins were further purified using a Reliasil C          reversedphase column Michrom  cm   mm IDon a          Microbore HPLC system Michrom Bioresources Inc USA          The insectselective toxin was loaded onto the C column          and eluted in a linear gradient of   Solvent B           acetonitrile  TFA over  min at a flow rate of           lmin                          Purity determination          The purity of the toxins was evaluated by free          solution capillary electrophoresis on an Applied          Biosystems capillary electrophoresis Model A The           cm capillary was equilibrated for  minutes with  mM          sodium citrate buffer pH  and the toxin  mgml          was loaded using vacuum for  seconds Resolution of          peaks were performed using  mM sodium citrate buffer          pH  at  kV electric potential and the absorbance          was monitored at  nm                          Mass spectrometry          The molecular mass of ButaIT was determined using          electrospray

ISCO LC syringe          pump at a flow rate of  lmin The purified toxin          collected from microbore HPLC was analyzed by direct flow          injection of  l The spectral analysis was done in a          positive ion mode at a capillary voltage of  kV a          cone voltage of  V and at a source temperature of C          Spectra were scanned over the range of  mz at a          rate of  secscan   scans were combined using the          VGMCA acquisition mode The molecular weight of the toxin          was determined using the maximum entropy deconvolution          algorithm MaxEnt to transform the range of  mz          to give a true mass scale spectrum The mass calibration          was performed using heart myoglobin Sigma                          Bioassay of toxins          The individual lyophilized fractions were dissolved in          deionized water and an appropriate concentration of each          fraction was injected into fourth instar           Heliothis virescens tobacco          budworm and last instar larvae of           Sarcophaga falculata blowfly The          neurotoxic symptoms in the larvae were observed          continuously for  minutes and also after  hr          postinjection Complete immobility or paralysis was          taken as an indication for the neurotoxic activity in          insect larvae Each fraction was also injected          subcutaneously into mice in order to check for any          mammalian toxicity                          Sequence determination          The purified ButaIT was reduced and carboxymethylated          by incubating in  M guanidine hydrochloride  M          TrisHCl pH   mM EDTA and  mM dithiothreitol for           hr at C Iodoacetic acid was added to a final          concentration of  mM and incubated for an additional          hour at C in the dark The Nterminal sequence of the          toxin was determined using HP GS sequence analyzer by          automated Edman degradation at the Molecular Structure          Facility of UC Davis                          Homology modeling          The amino acid sequence of ButaIT was submitted to          SwissModel Protein modeling server Guex and Peitsch           Peitsch  Peitsch  Preitsch and Guex           and the three dimensional model structure was          extracted as PDB file based on the NMR coordinates of
