Comptroller Generalof the United States United States General Accounting OfficeWashington DC BAugust  The Vice President of the United StatesDear Mr Vice PresidentPursuant to  USC  b I am submitting this reportbecause the Vice President as Chair of the National Energy PolicyDevelopment Group NEPDG has not provided the General AccountingOffice GAO with access to certain records relating to the processby which the National Energy Policy was developed I requestedthese records in writing on July   in accordance withsection  Despite repeated attempts we have been unable toresolve this disputeThe Vice President and his representatives have asserted thatGAO lacks the statutory authority to examine the activities of theNEPDG recognizing only GAOs authority to audit its financialtransactions They have also asserted that our examination wouldunconstitutionally interfere with the functioning of the executivebranch In addition to the arguments previously advanced by theVice Presidents representatives and addressed in our June letter to the Counsel to the Vice President see Enclosure  theVice Presidents August  letter to the Congress asserts that thestudy is not authorized by statute because GAO is limited tolooking at the results of programs and that GAO does not have aright of access to documents because the Vice President is notincluded under the term agency used in GAOs statuteAs discussed below we strongly disagree with the VicePresidents positions Disclosing the records we are seeking wouldnot reveal communications between the President and his advisersand would not unconstitutionally interfere with the functioning ofthe executive branch Furthermore GAO has ample authority toconduct this review and this authority has been recognized byvarious presidential administrations for many years Finallyneither the plain meaning of the statute nor the legislativehistory supports the Vice Presidents interpretation of the termsresults and agencyThe GAO as an institution and the Comptroller General as anofficer of the legislative branch assist the Congress inexercising its responsibilities under the Constitution to overseeinvestigate and legislate In order to help members of Congresscarry out their role and evaluate the process used to develop theNational Energy Policy GAO needs selected factual andnondeliberative records that the Vice President as Chair of theNEPDG or others representing the Group are in a position toprovide GAO The records we are requesting will assist the reviewof how the NEPDG spent public funds how it carried out itsactivities and whether applicable law was followed Descriptionsof the records we are requesting our efforts to obtain them andour statutory authorities are summarized belowDescription of Records RequestedIn May  the Comptroller General authorized this GAO studybased on a request from Representatives John D Dingell and HenryA Waxman Ranking Minority Members of the House Committee onEnergy and Commerce and the House Committee on Government Reformrespectively Our study is narrowly focused to answer the questionWhat process did the NEPDG use to develop the National EnergyPolicy To answer that question we have requested documents thatprovide the following informationWho was present at each of the group meetings conductedby the NEPDGWhat are the names of the professional staff assigned toprovide support to NEPDGWho did each of the members of the NEPDG including theVice President as Chair and its support staff meet with to gatherinformation for the National Energy Policy including the datesubject and location of the meetingsWhat direct and indirect costs were incurred indeveloping the National Energy PolicyIn communications with the Vice Presidents Counsel prior to theAugust  letter we offered to eliminate our earlier request forminutes and notes and for the information presented by members ofthe public Even though we are legally entitled to thisinformation as a matter of comity we are scaling back the recordswe are requesting to exclude these two items of informationFurthermore we have repeatedly emphasized that we are flexible inhow information is provided to GAO Despite these and other effortson our part to resolve the impasse the Vice Presidentsrepresentatives have shown no interest in reaching anyaccommodationFor example the information on who was present at each of thegroup meetings conducted by the NEPDG can be used to confirm thatonly fulltime officers or employees of the federal governmentattended the meetings and thus rule out the possibility that theFederal Advisory Committee Act FACA is applicable to meetings ofthe group FACA exempts from its provisions those committeescomposed wholly of fulltime federal officers or employeesSimilarly information on whom individual NEPDG members and staffmet with and the dates and subjects of the meetings would berelevant in confirming that meetings with members of the public didnot trigger FACA  USC app  These items of information are described in paragraph d ande and paragraph d ande of our letter of July  Efforts to Obtain RecordsGAO began its efforts to conduct this review on May  byfollowing our standard practice of calling a designated contact toset up an initial meeting with NEPDG staff See Enclosure  for achronology of our efforts to obtain the records Numerous phonecalls did not produce a meeting date Instead on May  the VicePresidents Counsel sent GAO a letter questioning theappropriateness of GAOs review expressing reluctance to supplythe information requested and asking for a statement of GAOs legalauthority to conduct the review We responded on June  that therequest was consistent with our authorities and asked for access torecords containing the information requestedOn June  the Vice Presidents Counsel again questioned GAOsauthority to conduct this review and in our June  reply weexplained our statutory authorities in detail We also repeated ourrequest for information relevant to our study Subsequent to ourJune  letter GAO officials have engaged in numerousconversations with the Vice Presidents representatives Howeverin these conversations the Vice Presidents representatives havefocused entirely on their view that GAO lacks authority to conductthis review rather than on reaching an accommodationOn July   the Comptroller General issued a letter to theVice President in his capacity as Chair of the NEPDG under USC  b requesting access to certain records relating toour study restating our authority for inspecting the records andthe reason for our inspection The Vice President did not respondto GAO with a description of the records withheld and the reasonsfor withholding them as required by the statute Instead he sentletters to the House of Representatives and the Senate on August  to inform them of GAOs actions and to serve as a response toGAOs July  letter In these letters he asserted that Iexceeded my lawful authority by undertaking this study He alsorefused to acknowledge GAOs basic statutory authorities andasserts that if the Comptroller Generals misconstruction of thestatutes were to prevail his conduct would unconstitutionallyinterfere with the functioning of the Executive BranchWhen records are not made available to GAO within a reasonabletime the provisions of  USC  b establish mechanisms forresolution of GAO accesstorecords problems Section bprovides that when GAO is not given access to records within areasonable time the Comptroller General may make a written requestfor such records to the agency head The official then has  daysto respond and the response is required to describe the recordwithheld and the reason the record is being withheld If GAO is notgiven an opportunity to inspect the record during this time periodthe Comptroller General may file a report to the President theCongress and other executive branch officials Twenty days afterfiling the report the Comptroller General may bring a civil actionin the district court of the United States for the District ofColumbia to require the official involved to produce the withheldrecordsAs this letter makes clear as Comptroller General of the UnitedStates I have broad discretion to conduct audits investigationsand examinations of executive branch activities either at therequest of Congress or on my own authority Furthermore we do notagree that disclosure of the limited factual and nondeliberativeinformation we are seeking such as the names of participants atmeetings would unconstitutionally interfere with the functioningof the executive branch In support of this proposition the VicePresidents August  letter states that preservation of theability of the executive branch to function effectively requiresrespecting the confidentiality of communications among a Presidenta Vice President the Presidents other senior advisers andothers However as we have made clear in several discussions withthe Vice Presidents representatives we are not asking for anycommunications involving the President the Vice President or thePresidents senior advisers We are simply asking for facts thatthe Vice President as Chair of the NEPDG or others representingthe group would be in a position to provide to GAO These includethe names of attendees dates and locations and the subjects ofthe meetingsThe Vice President has also expressed concern regarding certainrequests for his personal schedule We understand and appreciatethe Vice Presidents concerns regarding release of his personalschedule As a result we have made clear to the Vice Presidentsrepresentatives that we are not seeking a copy of his calendar orinformation on meetings held other than in his capacity as Chair ofthe NEPDG As we have emphasized we are seeking certain factualinformation on meetings the Vice President held in his capacity asChair of the GroupAlthough the Vice President did not use the term ExecutivePrivilege in his August  letter his assertion that providingthese facts would unconstitutionally interfere with the executivebranch and his focus on confidentiality of communications use thesame language and reasoning as assertions of Executive PrivilegeIn our view the information that GAO seeks is not protected byExecutive Privilege As noted above the information we are seekingis factual and nondeliberative in nature In fact the VicePresidents Counsel has already informed the House Committee onEnergy and Commerce and the House Committee on Government Reformthat the meetings the support staff and other NEPDG members hadwere to gather information relevant to the NEPDGs work and werenot deliberative inThe right to invoke Executive Privilege rests with thePresident and Presidents have had different procedures forasserting it President Reagan for example required the agencyhead if a substantial question was raised to notify and consultwith the Attorney General and the White House Counsels Office ThePresident would decide whether to assert the privilege PresidentClinton modified President Reagans policy by requiring the agencyhead to directly notify the White House Counsel The White HouseCounsel was to seek an accommodation and if unsuccessful toconsult with the Attorney General Again the President determinedwhether to invoke the privilegenature Even where the President has made a formal claim ofExecutive Privilege which is not the case here federal courtshave held that the executive and legislative branches have a dutyto attempt to reach a mutual accommodation As we have statedearlier the Vice Presidents representatives have declined todiscuss reaching any accommodationThe information we are seeking is of the type that has beencommonly provided to GAO for many years spanning severaladministrations Furthermore in prior GAO reviews of workinggroups established by the President we have received informationon participation by outside parties Most recently GAO reviewedactivities of the White House China Trade Relations Working Groupwhich was established at the request of President Clinton in theexercise of his Constitutional powers In this review GAO wasprovided thousands of documents including copies of emails andother information identifying group members contacts with outsidegroups and individuals Previously at the request of theRepublican Ranking Minority Member of the House Committee onGovernment Operations GAO reviewed activities of PresidentClintons Task Force on Health Care Reform and was provided with anextensive listing of working group participants drawn from thegovernment and from outside organizations Moreover some membersof the NEPDG have already provided us with information identical inkind to the type of information we are seeking from the VicePresident in his capacity as Chair of the NEPDG and from NEPDGstaff members For example the Secretaries of Energy and Interiorand the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency haveprovided us with information concerning who they met with todevelop the National Energy Policy when the meetings occurredwhere they occurred and what the general topics wereGAOs Basic Audit AuthorityGAOs basic authority stems from the Budget and Accounting Actof  which as discussed below provides GAO with broad andcomprehensive authority to investigate all matters relating to theuse of public money Succeeding legislation affecting GAOsauthority has generally served to emphasize the role of review andanalysis by GAO as a means of enhancing congressional oversightover activities of the executive branch TheLetter from David S Addington Counsel to the Vice Presidentto the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the HouseCommittee on Government Reform May   The letter enclosedthe responses of the Executive Director of the NEPDG to a letterdated April   from the Ranking Minority Members of the twocommitteesSee eg United States v American Telephone and TelegraphCo  F d  DC Cir As the principal legislative history accompanying the GeneralAccounting Office Act of  explains With the growth in thenumber of Federal programs and agencies the Congress has bynecessity become more dependent on GAO assistance in fulfilling itsoversight and legislative responsibilities GAO not only providesCongress with essential information about Federal programs butalso uniquely exercises statutory authority tocontinuedGAO headed by the Comptroller General is a principal means bywhich the legislative branch conducts oversight of executiveprograms and activitiesNotwithstanding the broad authority vested in GAO and theComptroller General by the Congress the Vice Presidents August letter again questioned GAOs basic authority to do this reviewHowever as we explained in our June   letter to theCounsel to the Vice President our inquiry is authorized by USC   and  Section  authorizes GAO to investigateall matters related to the receipt disbursement and use ofpublic money and there is no doubt that public money was used tofund the activities of the NEPDG The Counsel has asserted thatsection  limits GAOs audit authority to financialtransactions As we explained in our June  letter the Counselsnarrow interpretation of section  is inconsistent with thelanguage and legislative history of the statute as well as yearsof GAO practice The statute extends GAOs audit authority to allmatters related to the use of public money not just costs ofactivitiesSection b also clearly authorizes this study It providesthat the Comptroller General shall evaluate the results of aprogram or activity the Government carries out under existing lawThe Counsels assertion that the phrase existing law is limitedto statutes and excludes the Constitution is unsupported As weexplained in our June  letter the Counsel failed to supply anyevidence from the statutory language legislative history or caselaw to support the assertion that Congress intended the phraseexisting law to exclude the Constitution the highest law of thelandThe Vice Presidents August  letter noted that section authorizes GAO to review the results of agency programs andactivities and stated that the Comptroller General is notevaluating the results of the Groups work he is attempting toinquire into the process by which the results of the Groups workwere reached In effect the August  letter suggests that section does not provide GAO with authority to review the processes anagency follows in establishing or implementing a program oractivity We strongly disagree with this viewThe Presidential Memorandum establishing the NEPDG provided thatone of the results of this action would be the gathering ofinformation relevant to a national energy policy Thus themeetings that are the focus of our review were the result of agovernmental activitythe establishment of the NEPDG The NEPDGcarried out many activities the results of which are subject toevaluation by GAO under the plain meaning of the statute Howeverthe Vice Presidents August  letter in effect interprets resultsas being restricted to end results or ultimate results Underthis narrow construction of the statute GAO would beprohibitedcontinuedparticipate directly in the oversight process as an independentcongressional entity S Rep No  at   reprintedin  USCCAN   Id at from scrutinizing any agency activity except the final programresult Thus even if GAO were able to identify certaindeficiencies in a land management plan for example GAO would beprohibited from examining the process used to develop the plan inorder to suggest improvements This would clearly be contrary tothe role that Congress has established for GAOThere is no indication in section  or its legislative historythat Congress intended to take such a narrow view of GAOsauthority In fact GAO has long interpreted its audit authority asencompassing reviews of agency processes This position which hasnot been challenged by any prior administration is reflected inthe many congressional requests we receive to review agencyprocesses for a broad variety of activities Several recentexamples include GAOs review of the process the Forest Serviceused to modify the Tongass National Forest plan the process usedby NASA to contract for the design and delivery of theinternational space station propulsion module and the processused by the Army Corps of Engineers in preparing an environmentalimpact statement for actions related to the Snake River damsThe legislative history of the Legislative Reorganization Act of which enacted the authority now contained in section bsupports a broad interpretation of GAOs authority The objectivewas to enhance GAOs role of review and analysis as part of alarger effort to fortify congressional oversight by making moreinformation available to Members and Committees of the Congressandproviding them a means of interpreting the information theyhave Clearly it would have been contrary to the overall thrustof the Act for Congress to exclude from GAOs purview agencyprocesses and activities that are routinely the subject ofcongressional oversight Accordingly it is unreasonable toconclude that by using the term results in section  Congressintended to limit and restrict GAOs review authority to simplyreviewing end results Moreover in any eventTongass National Forest Process Used to Modify the Forest PlanGAORCED April  International Space Station Propulsion Module ProcurementProcess GAOR April  Army Corps of Engineers An Assessment of the DraftEnvironmental Impact Statement of the Lower Snake River DamsGAORCED July  HR Rep No  at  reprinted in  USCCAN There is no question that Congress has expansive oversightpowers with respect to agency processes and activities NumerousSupreme Court precedents recognize a broad and encompassing powerin Congress to engage in oversight and investigation Thus inEastlandv United States Servicemens Fund  US   n  the Court stated that the scope of Congress power ofinquiry is as penetrating and farreaching as the potential powerto enact and appropriate under the Constitutionsection  grants GAO broad authority to investigate allmatters related to the use of public money and necessarily includesthe agency processes in implementing programsWhile generally asserting that GAO lacks authority to do thisreview the Vice President has acknowledged GAOs authority in onearea agreeing that we can look into the direct and indirectexpenses of the NEPDG under section  To this end on June his representatives provided us with  pages of miscellaneousdocuments purporting to relate to direct and indirect costsincurred in the development of the National Energy Policy As wehave advised the Vice Presidents representatives the submissionis incomplete and is not fully responsive Moreover it isvirtually impossible to analyze the documentation We cannot do ameaningful review without an explanation of the nature and purposesof these costs and the appropriation that was charged Thus far wehave sought to obtain adequate relevant records and explanationswithout successGAOs Statutory Right of AccessThe Vice President in his August  letter also asserts that theterm agency in  USC   does not include the VicePresident because he is a constitutional officer of the governmentHowever as noted above we are requesting records from the VicePresident in his capacity as Chair of the NEPDG The Vice Presidentprovides no support for interpreting the term agency in Title as excluding the NEPDG Title  defines an agency subject toGAOs authority very expansively to mean a department agency orinstrumentality of the United States government but not thelegislative branch or the Supreme Court As broadly as the termagency is now defined the statutory language before thecodification of Title  in  emphasizes its expansivenessBefore the codification the relevant term was department orestablishment defined in  USC    to include anyexecutive department independent commission board bureauoffice agency or other establishment of the Government Giventhe breadth of the statutory language the NEPDG as chaired by theVice President is clearly an agency under Title  of the UnitedStates CodeThe legislative history of the General Accounting Office Act of which amended GAOs access statute now  USC   toauthorize GAO to enforce its right of access to agency recordsmade it abundantly clear that Congress viewed the President andhisSee Enclosure  pp  for a fuller discussionFor example some pages provided are simply numbers or dollaramounts without an indication of the nature or purpose associatedwith the amount or consist only of a drawing of cell or deskphones Others have multiple charges for moving phones or otherequipment without identifying whether the moves were for NEPDGstaff and which of the multiple charges are relevant to the movesIn addition there is nothing that identifies the support staff andthe White House Fellow referred to as the group support staffassigned to provide support to the NEPDGclosest advisers as being within GAOs access authority andsubject to access enforcement actions A key purpose of the Act was to strengthen GAOs ability to obtain access to records inthe face of opposition by agencies including the White House Theprincipal legislative history accompanying the Act chronicled thedifferent access problems GAO had encountered in obtaining recordsto which it was legally entitled including serious access torecords difficulties at the White House These included an auditthat required GAO to obtain unemployment estimates from the Councilof Economic AdvisersThe Senate report accompanying the  Act explicitlyrecognized that the President and his principal advisers andassistants are within the scope of GAOs access rights andenforcement authority In order to accommodate executive branchconcerns about the extent to which GAO could judicially compeldisclosure of highly sensitive information Congress added thecertification mechanism This enables the President and theDirector of the Office and Management and Budget OMB to precludea suit by the Comptroller General under certain specialconditions As the Senate report explainedWith regard to enforcement actions at the Presidential levelcertifications provided for under section d now sectiondC are intended to authorize the President and theDirector of the Office of Management and Budget to preclude a suitby the Comptroller General against the President and his principaladvisers and assistants and against those units within theExecutive Office of the President whose sole function is to adviseand assist the President for information which would not beavailable under the Freedom of Information ActS Rep No  reprinted in  USCCAN The Justice Department ultimately conceded that the Council ofEconomic Advisors was subject to GAOs access authority andprovided the records In this regard during hearings that predatedthe  Act the Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Officeof Legal Counsel testified The long and the short of it is thatvirtually every piece of information that was requested waseventually provided and it was provided because the AttorneyGeneral said this is what we think the law requires GAOLegislation Hearings before the Subcomm on Energy NuclearProliferation and Federal Services of the Senate Comm onGovernmental Affairs th Cong  S Rep No  at  reprinted in  USCCAN atThe certification provision now contained in  USC dC precludes a suit by the Comptroller General if thePresident or Director of OMB certifies that  the records couldbe withheld under either of two Freedom of Information Actexemptions in  USC  bdeliberative process and USC  blaw enforcement records and  disclosurecould reasonably be expected to impair substantially the operationof the governmentS Rep No  at  reprinted in  USCCAN atThus it is clear that Congress crafted the certificationprovision as a carefully balanced compromise that ensures thePresident can protect the confidentiality of highly sensitiveinformation the disclosure of which would substantially impair theoperations of government while affording the Comptroller Generalthe access to information he needs to fulfill his responsibilitiesunder the law Congress would not have needed to add thecertification provision to protect the presidential advisers iftheir records were not within the scope of GAOs accessauthoritySubmission of ReportSince GAO has a legal right of access to the requested documentsand since full access was not provided within  days following ourJuly  letter pursuant to  USC b I now submit thisreport to you and the other designated officials Unless anexemption under section d is invoked such as certificationby the President or Director of OMB I am authorized to bring acivil action for judicial enforcement of our access request if fulland complete access to the records we are requesting is notprovided to GAO within  days following the filing of thisreportI seek your assistance in resolving this matter in a timelymanner We are hopeful that this pending access problem can beresolved expeditiously without litigation and in a manner thatwill allow us to fulfill our oversight and reportingresponsibilities to the Congress If you or your representativeshave any questions or would like
