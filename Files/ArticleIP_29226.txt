DearPrudence                                                      When behind thewheel of a car I would never consider parking in a spot designated for afellow driver with disabilities as I dont belong to this group However whenshopping or recreating and in need of a public restroom I always opt for thebathroom stall designed for my fellow citizens with disabilities They areuniformly more spacious better stocked and I like the handrails I have yetto emerge from such a spot to find someone more deserving of such amenitiescooling their heels so to speak and since my caffeine intake is too highthese pit stops are more or less regular events Am I being callous andinsensitive or appropriately opportunistic                                       Doubting                        Dear Doubt            Funny you should bringthis up Prudie does exactly the same thing preferring as you do the largerspace along with the private mirror and sink Like you Prudie has never seena disabled person waiting though that would not be the end of the worldConsidering the length of time one may park vs the time needed in therestroom the issues are clearly different Prudie often sees women take thehandicapped stall simply because it becomes available first Prudie is hardlyever in the mens room  unless of course it is an individual bathroom andthe girls room is taken            Prudie

beautiful The reception was lovely too and when the time camefor my daughter to toss her bouquet all the single women gathered So did thechildren at the wedding my four nieces They range in age from  to  butthe yearold is an especially energetic childand tall for her age tooSo before the toss I dashed over to whisper in her ear that there were olderladies right behind her and to take care not to trip them One of those ladieswas my daughters new motherinlaw who is my age which is to say not old just not agile enough in high heels to compete with an athletic little girlwho may not know her own strength My niece did indeed catch the bouquet andno one was hurt My question is this Should children not old enough to datemuch less marry be included in the bouquet toss I dont think wild
