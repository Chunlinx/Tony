                                 How To Do an IPO                        In purely financial terms yesterdays initial public offering from Linuxnetworker Andovernet will go down as just another in a series of remarkablefirstday debuts The companys shares priced at  opened at close to and closed the day at   Andovernets shares jumped another  points today In other words it looked just like a typical tech IPO in thisfrothiest of markets But in fact there was nothing typical about the successof the Andovernet IPO This was a deal the ramifications of which were goingto be feeling for years to come            Thats because Andovernet was the third company to be taken public by WRHambrecht the investment bank that is attempting to transform the IPO processby replacing the traditional method of allocating shares and setting openingprices with whats called a Dutch auction See                   Slate               s Explainerfor more on Dutch auctions In a typical IPO the lead underwriter sets aninitial filing price then takes provisional orders from institutionalinvestors that it uses to gauge demand The filing price can be adjusted upwardif demand is strong enough but in general the offering price for a companygoing public is considerably below the marketclearing price As a resultinvestors who are able to get in on an IPO have a very good chance of reapingsome easy gains            In a Dutch auction by contrast the price is essentially determined by theinvestors who submit the highest price theyre willing to pay and the numberof shares they want at that price The people who bid the highest and if theybid the same price the earliest get first dibs on the shares which are thenallocated in order from highest to lowest bid until theyre all gone Nomatter what you bid though the price you pay is the lowest price that anyinvestor who got shares bid            This is a superior way of pricing an IPO because no one gets shares on thebasis of who they know and because it ensures that the company going publicisnt going to leave too much money on the table by going public at a lowerprice than the one the market was willing to pay Its also superior because iteliminates the middleman the investment bank and lets the market set theprice            Given the more general move in business toward disintermediation it seemsinevitable that eventually this will be the way most companies go public ButHambrechts Dutchauction strategy has gotten off to a slow start because itsfirst two IPOs for Ravenswood Winery and Saloncom were relative busts atleast in the sense that neither company has seen a significant gain over itsoffering price If investors feel they cant make money investing in IPOsunderwritten by Hambrecht theyll pay less for them then they would if thesame companies were being underwritten by more established investment banksthereby defeating the whole purpose of going public with Hambrecht            Thats why Andovernets awesome debut with its price soaring  percenton the opening day is so important It suggests as I argued atthe time of Saloncoms IPO that the problem with the earlier Hambrechtofferings was not the Dutchauction idea but rather the quality of thecompanies that were going public Take a real company in a hot sector likeAndovernet and investors can make a lot of money even as the company itselfraises more cash in the IPO than it would have done otherwise            There is to be sure something of a paradox here since if the point ofhaving a Dutch auction is for the company not to leave any money on the tablethe  percent jump in Andovernets stock price might seem to suggest thatthe auction didnt work all that well But there are two things to keep in mindhere The first and more mundane point is that you have to have a brokerageaccount with Hambrecht to participate in its IPOs so the number of potentialinvestors in any Hambrecht offering is significantly smaller than the number ofinvestors who might be interested in that offering Of course the more IPOslike yesterdays Hambrecht has the more customers itll get since anyone whohas  can open an account The second and related point is that nocompany can control the retail market for its stock The marketclearing priceat  am in other words will not be the marketclearing price at noon or at pm and thats true for all stocks not just IPOs Now as investors becomemore comfortable with Dutch auctions and as more investors take part in thesekinds of IPOs the spread between the offering price and the first daysclosing price will narrow and that will be a good thing But for now the percent leap Andovernet took is very good news the first significant blowagainst Wall Streets oldschool IPO process
