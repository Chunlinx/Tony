                 well do you have any good ideas about this problem   well i i i live in Fort Lauderdale now which is of course very close to Miami   right   in fact my fiance works in Miami uh downtown quite a bit so crimes a definite concern also before this i was in Boston where the crime rates also fairly high   uhhuh   uh so it its definitely a concern something that needs to be worked on i know that it affects my everyday life in that uh you know my fiance is very paranoid about making sure everythings locked   right   uh you know it it also concerns me because i have a convertible and uh you know theres certain areas around here where id be afraid to drive with my top down   yeah well i have the same thing  and i understand because i live very close to Dallas so we have quite a crime rate too but im not real sure what to do recently its been kind of a topic at work and um i just kind of feel that theres a lot of people in jail for crimes that are not really against a person and i think maybe we need to find another way to punish those people and put the real criminals in jail where they really cant do any harm and not let them out on parole in six months or three years or whatever and put them to work doing something useful where they dont just eat up our tax dollars   sure   and thats kind of what weve come up with  but i dont know what are your feelings about that   well i mean yeah except the the problem with that of course is defining what whats a real crime then you know what whats a crime that counts   right well a dangerous thing you know where you will get hurt if theyre out on the streets i mean it i think this deal of Leona Helmsley has just kind of brought this all home and thats what kind of sparked the discussion was that this is a seventy seventy two year old lady gonna go use up tax dollars in jail and i just i just have a real problem with that i think theres another way to deal with that other than put this lady in jail to set an example   but putting it that way that is kind of ironic that shed be using up tax dollars but   thats right   uh   you know that really is true   sure uh however you know some of the crimes that people ought to be locked up for are uh are uh you know not even things that would be major crimes but theyd still be dangerous for example uh drunken driving   well thats true well that is a potential danger though youre right about that but   you know but   um traffic tickets things like that i mean ive known of people just to be picked up because they didnt pay their traffic tickets and   you know but   i i say yeah fine them extra do whatever but to go ahead and put them in jail it costs us money when they do that so i dont know i just have a problem with overcrowded jails on crimes that nobodys really gonna get hurt uh financially maybe and and things like that and yes it has to be dealt with but im not sure thats the way   well that that that is true that the uh amount of uh you know it it is true that uh you know jail as a concept at least is not working in some cases   yeah   you know uh   yeah and also i think that they can get off on too many technicalities i think that it turns out sometimes that the victims are the ones that have to defend themselves rather than the criminals and i think thats another thing that needs to be addressed too   i i think a   i think you have much many rights as a victim   sure i i i think its very sad however uh you know i i i can see some of that in that and i still dont necessarily agree with that but i mean that the thing is that uh you know were talking about affecting someones you know livelihood sometimes their life even on some of the more heinous crimes   right   and uh uh its a you know you according to the system weve got theyre presumed innocent or get another trial   umhum   you know so yeah they they do have to do some of that stuff although i do agree with you that its thats another thing thats not quite right   yeah i think so and i dont know i ive been through a two year divorce recently and i find that the system sucks to put it bluntly and so you know  i just i dont have a lot of respect anymore for what i thought you know would be fair you just figure oh well the judge will be fair well forget it  you know its not it doesnt happen theyre in a hurry their docket is full they want you in they want you out   sure   and thats the way it is and so   my my fiances a lawyer so i definitely understand that   umhum umhum   uh course in Florida the judges are elected so um not only are they not fair they try to be popular at times   yeah   you know which is not necessarily right   yeah so i dont know but i dont know how you and i can solve this  thats the problem you know we all have ideas but nothing seems to change and im not sure how it can   well uh i i think you had a part of what we need to do earlier is uh
