Session Identifying ED Patients with Alcohol ProblemsRobert Woolard MDMany patients in the emergency department ED have alcoholproblems and they can be identified Research on techniques usedto identify these patients has been conducted but several areas ofinterest should be addressed by further research We need tofurther examine and refine alcoholscreening questionnaires in theED We need to determine the sequence and combination of questionsand tests that constitute the best screening process We need tostudy barriers to screening identify factors that promotescreening implementation and demonstrate the impact of a screeningprogram in the ED The final aim of screening must be improvedoutcomes through referral and counseling Identification is onlythe first step in a process of careAlcohol problems definedAlcohol problems designate a spectrum from risk behavior toillness and from problematic consumption to alcohol use disorderWe must be careful when interpreting the results of studies and inour own design of screening procedures that we are clear about theendpoints we are measuring Clinicians in the ED are interested inscreening for several alcohol endpoints Acute intoxication is ofconcern to emergency physicians Intoxication in a driver wouldcertainly be considered an alcohol problem The blood or breathalcohol concentration BAC coupled with our clinicalobservations may help us identify intoxication Most alcoholscreening tests identify patients with alcohol use disorders orproblematic consumption of alcohol The American PsychiatricAssociation in DSM IIIR IV and the World Health OrganizationWHO in the th and th International Classification of DiseasesICD  have rigorously defined alcohol abuse and alcoholdependence These definitions largely agree for dependence butnot for abuse DSM includes social and legal consequences of abuseand ICD has only medical and psychological consequences Fewercases of alcohol abuse meet the ICD definition In general analcohol use disorder is present when an aspect of the patientsfunction has been compromisedby alcohol Before function is compromised problematicconsumption occurs Much of the emphasis of screening has shiftedtoward identifying patients with high alcohol consumption beforedisease develops WHO defines hazardous drinking as  or moredrinksday for men and  or more drinksday for women The NationalInstitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism NIAAA defines atriskdrinking as consumption of more than  drinksweek or more than drinksoccasion for men ages  to  For women of all ages andmen older than age  more than  drinksweek or more than drinksoccasion is considered at risk Binge drinking alone is alsoof concern and has been variably defined as more than    or drinks on an occasionCharacteristics of an ideal ED screening test or sequence oftestsAn ideal screening test would be accurate practical andmotivational The accuracy of a test can be measured in severalways For a screening test high sensitivity is the most desirableparameter High sensitivity ensures that most of the patients withproblems will be detected High specificity is also desirable tohelp ensure that positive tests represent real problems There is atrade off between sensitivity and specificity defined by thereceiver operator curve The area under the operator curve bestreflects the performance of a test the larger the area the betterthe test Each point on the curve represents a potential cutpoint A cut point with a high sensitivity and specificity shouldbe manifest in an ideal testTheoretically an ideal test should remain accurate throughoutthe alcohol use spectrum However real tests dont performuniformly across a spectrum For example if were interested inidentifying patients with binge drinking we can define bingedrinking as    or  drinks on an occasion Screening testsdesigned for patients with more severe problems  drinks will beless sensitive at identifying patients with less severe problems drinksAn ideal test would perform uniformly in all populations andsubgroups However when we screen populations with high caserates trauma admissions  a highly sensitive test withmoderate specificity performs well The same test used to screen apopulation with low case rates pregnant clinic patients  doesnot perform as well In this population a test with higherspecificity may be needed to avoidtoo many false positives A test that is used to screen adiverse population such as ED patients will perform better insome subgroups than others based of the different case rates amongsubgroupsAn ideal test should remain accurate in the presence of commonED problems such as stress injury acute illness intoxicationother drug use depression and anxiety disorders Many of thescreening tests were developed outside the ED Fortunately manyhave been applied to ED populations Hence their performance hasbeen demonstrated in the presence of some of these distractingfactors An ideal test should also remain accurate with differencesin gender age race ethnicity or language Some variation intest performance among demographic groups has been demonstrated instudies of screening tests in the ED An ideal test in the EDwould address both current and lifetime alcohol problems Currentuse would more likely prompt referral or counseling but past usepredicts poor outcome from medical problems such as injuryIn research trials the impracticality of a screening test maynot be evident Research staff do not have to contend with adding ascreening test to an already lengthy list of clinical care dutiesIn clinical practice several practical issues will make all thedifference to successful implementation The ease of use of ascreening test will determine its success Staff with any level ofprior health training and little additional training should be ableto administer an ideal test Results should be immediatelyavailable and easy to interpret The test should be acceptable toregulators payers ED staff and ED patientsSeveral factors may interfere with implementation For examplepatients may find certain questions offensive or they may not bewilling to have blood drawn or submit to breathalyzers Clinicalstaff may be uncomfortable asking some types of questionsRegulators may restrict access to records based on answers tocertain questions and add burdens to hospital recordkeepersPayers may pay for some tests and not others These and otherfactors may reduce the effectiveness of a screening procedure thathas been proven effective in research trialsMost experts agree that an ideal ED test is brief  to minutes Most of the quest to develop efficient ED screening hasemphasized brevity However a longer test could beselfadministered An ideal screening test should not interferewith the routine sequence of medical history physical examinationand laboratory testing The test should beconfidential since there may be legal financial or socialconsequences to screening positive Finally the ideal test shouldactually motivate the patient to further assessment counseling orreferral as neededCurrently available screening testsBased on current evidence screening should be undertaken usingone or a combination of structured questionnaires Screeningundertaken using clinical impression or biochemical tests is not asaccurate or as sensitive as structured questionnaires foridentifying alcohol use disorders or problematic consumption Ofcourse BAC can help identify acute intoxication The alcoholconcentration can be determined by saliva testing breath analysisor blood testClinical impressionClinicians often use their general impression to help withdiagnosis but clinical impressions concerning alcohol problems canbe inaccurate Trained practitioners counseling alcoholics couldidentify only  of acutely intoxicated patients Primary carephysicians and emergency physicians identified fewer than  ofpatients with alcohol problems Unfortunately the majority ofphysicians  screen only those patients they suspect based ontheir clinical impressions Stereotypic profiling may be theconsequence of screening only suspected patients Gentilelloreported that in a trauma center ED staff suspected alcoholism in of patients who screened negative on structured questionnairesThese patients were more likely to be young male disheveleduninsured and low income Of course some ED patients mayspontaneously volunteer information about drinking Cherpitelreported that patient selfreport of drinking prior to arrival hada sensitivity of  for alcohol problems in the EDStructured questionnairesSelfreport may be enhanced when specific alcohol questions areasked Cyr reported that a single question in a primary caresettingHave you ever had a drinking problemhad a highsensitivity  to  Subsequent reports from otherinstitutions did not replicate the high sensitivity of this singlequestion Cherpitel evaluated single question screens in theED and found them to be less sensitive than structuredquestionnairesMost existing screens were developed for primary care settingsto detect alcohol use disorders The CAGE was developed in  asa brief screening tool for primary care providers to detect alcoholabuse and dependence CAGE is a mnemonic from four questions Cutdown Annoyed Guilty and Eye opener The questions addressproblems over the patients lifetime CAGE takes  to  minutes toadministerThe MAST Michigan AlcoholScreening Test developed in  asa screen for alcohol abuse and dependence has  yesno questionsMAST has been selfadministered and used in a

was developed to screen pregnant patients foratrisk drinking alcohol abuse and dependence It is athreequestion screen that takes about  minuteOne screen has been developed for emergency department use theRapid Alcohol Assessment Screen RAPS Cherpitel screened an EDpopulation with questions from CAGE BMAST AUDIT and TWEAK Shecreated RAPS by combining the four highestyield questions fromthose screens which covered feeling guilty after drinkingblackouts failing to do what is normally expected after drinkingand morning drinking However this new instrument has not beenstudied when administered as a standalone testIn addition to these questionnaires NIAAA suggests that allprimary care physicians ask an opening questionDo you drinkalcohol followed by three questions about alcohol consumptionand then the CAGE This sequence was not explicitly designed orstudied as a screening test DOnofrio and others haverecommended using the NIAAA approach in the EDStudies of screening testsCherpitel conducted two studies comparing multiple screeningtests in the ED In the first study TWEAK and AUDIT were mostsensitive identifying  and  of patients respectively withan ICD diagnosis of alcohol dependence In the second studyRAPS and AUDIT were more sensitive than TWEAK and CAGE identifying and  compared with  and  respectively of patientswith an ICD or DSMIV diagnosis of alcohol dependence harmfuldrinking or abuseSoderstrom has compared multiple screening tests in a traumacenter He reported that CAGE performed best with a sensitivity of for a DSMIV diagnosis of alcohol dependence

biasesCherpitel analyzed variability of test performance in subgroupsof ED patients In her first ED study CAGE BMAST AUDIT andTWEAK were less sensitive among females whites and noninjuredpatients Inher second ED study with Hispanic patients CAGE BMAST AUDITTWEAK and RAPS were less sensitive in females patients with lessacculturation and nondependent drinkers Lowering the cut pointon these screening instruments improved sensitivity without loss ofspecificity among females Using lower cut points for females maymaximize screening test performanceBradley reviewed nine studies with data on womens responses toscreening mainly in primary care settings CAGE AUDIT and TWEAKwere the best tests for alcohol dependence among women Theirreported sensitivities were  to  All three screens performedbetter among black women than among white women TWEAK performedbetter than CAGE or AUDIT among white women CAGE and AUDIT had lowsensitivities  and  respectively for alcohol dependenceamong white women We must be careful not to employ screeningtechniques that do not address important subgroupsEvidence of such low sensitivity in an important subgroup maynecessitate use of multiple screens tailored to subgroups Inaddition to women other subgroups such as adolescents olderadults pregnant women psychiatric patients and Spanish speakersmay need screening with modified or unique tests Standard screensmay not perform as well in these patient subgroups that mayrepresent a considerable part of the ED population Adjustment ofcut points or use of alternative screening tests may be necessaryfor these subgroupsAlcohol concentrationMany injured ED patients are screened with a BAC which can helpidentify intoxication The presence of alcohol may not alwaysindicate an alcohol problem While a very high BAC in an unimpairedpatient can be a specific screen for dependence BAC is aninsensitive screen for an alcohol use disorder One study foundthat only onethird of intoxicated drivers had an alcohol usedisorder In an ED study BAC was a poor screen for alcohol abuseor dependence with a sensitivity of  less sensitive thanselfreported drinking In another ED study a saliva alcohollevel equivalent to a BAC greater than  gdl in an injuredpatient identified harmful drinkers AUDIT   with a sensitivity of  In one traumacenter BAC had a sensitivity of  for an alcohol disorderOther biochemical markers such as mean corpuscular volume plateletcount liver enzymes gammaglutamyltransferase GGTaspartate aminotransferase AST alanine aminotransferaseALT and carbohydrate deficient transferrin CDT perform poorlywith sensitivities of  to  for alcohol use disorders orproblematic consumption Biochemical tests other than BAC mayhave use in settings other than an ED but they offer little asscreening tests for ED patientsResearch questions improving existing screeningquestionnairesWe still need to find the most accurate test for ED use Thismay be RAPS which is designed for the ED but it needs furtherdirect testing Many tests would be improved by wording questionsto address current problems the past year or three months ratherthan lifetime problems Screening with embedded questions andindirect questions may also improve selfreport among adolescentsand other groups These approaches need further testing inthe EDThe most practical test may be the shortest the threequestionNET Further sequencing of questions within questionnaires may alsoimprove efficiency If one question answered yes yields apositive test score asking that one first and stopping as soon asthe score is positive would be the most efficient approachCherpitel has analyzed the sensitivity of each of the RAPSquestions and sequenced them from most to least sensitive for mostefficient useMinimizing question sets for interviews will result in obtainingless information Computeradministered or selfadministeredscreens may address this issue by allowing patients to spend moretime completing indepth questioning with no additional stafftime This approach promises practical avenues for obtainingmore information A trial of screening tests in various formatseg interview selfadministered forms and computerinteraction should be undertaken to compare their cost and valuein the EDThe most motivational screening test is unknown Drawing bloodand confronting patients with their blood alcohol levels mayactually push them away from counseling Screening questions thatreveal the negative consequences or link alcohol to currentproblems may motivate patients to seek counseling Providingimmediate feedback may help make the transition from screening tocounseling with little additional intervention The motivationalaspects of a variety of screens with and without verbal orcomputer feedback need to be exploredResearch questions finding the best approach to screeningTo determine the best of the available screens a multicentertrial with a broad demographic mix and a large number of patientssubjected to different screens is needed Further evaluation shouldbe performed of lower cut points for TWEAK CAGE and AUDIT Theadvantage of tailored screens or specific questions for subgroupssuch as women adolescents and elders needs to bedetermined RAPS must be further tested as a standalone screen inisolation and against other tests A longer selfadministeredscreenincluding one administered by computershould also be testedin the EDTo determine the best sequence for screening the approachrecommended by NIAAA for primary care should be compared with othersequences Several trials of variations of the NIAAA approach arewarranted Trials should be conducted starting with other or noopening questions using other consumption questions such as thosein AUDIT using other screens such as TWEAK rather than CAGEchanging the sequence to CAGE or TWEAK followed by consumptionquestions and checking BAC at the beginning or end of theprotocolThe best screen should be determined in the context of ascreening and intervention program Some questions or screens maylead naturally to referral and treatment Others may not promotereferral and treatment Much of the screening literature isisolated from intervention Future studies need to incorporateevaluation of screening linked to intervention protocolsBarriers to implementing screeningIn a research protocol in England nurses were trained to screenall emergency patients with CAGE and then provide feedback Only of patients were screened Of them  had positive CAGEscores of those only  were provided feedback Even withfeedback only  accepted followup Of  patients only were entered into the trial and the trial was abandonedThere are multiple barriers to screening Nurses identified lackof resources inadequate training stress poor morale and noperceived value to the intervention In a survey sponsored by theWest Virginia Chapter of the American College of EmergencyPhysicians a minority of emergency physicians reported routinescreening and counseling of ED patients The authors reportedprovider attitudes of disinterestavoidance disdain and pessimism as well as inadequate timeinsufficient education and lack of resources as barriers Surveysand interventions should be undertaken to define and reducebarriers to implementing screening in clinical practiceCurrently screening is a research tool not a clinical tool EDstaff does not use structured questionnaires for alcohol screeningED staff has no systematic approach to alcohol screening Staffchooses to screen some individuals and not others based on clinicalsuspicions or partially implemented protocols In general ED staffscreens less often than addiction experts recommendUniversal screening is appropriate in populations with high caserates EDs have reported high case rates of alcohol problemsespecially acute intoxication from  to  Withinthe ED there are even higher case rates in subgroups Majortrauma injuries assaults depression and alcoholrelatedmedical problems like gastrointestinal bleeding or seizures defineeven higher risk subgroups Many experts advocate focusingscreening on some of the highestrisk groups or screening withgreater intensity and different tools in these groupsImplementing screening in clinical practiceAny ED staff member could be assigned the screening taskPhysician nurse clerical social work or volunteer staff canconduct screening We do not know which staff group will be mosteffective Selfadministered questionnaires computer screeninteractions or interview techniques may be easier to implementScreening questions can be standalone or embedded into generalhealth questionnaires or existing registration physician andnurse documentation Screening protocols can be mandatory orvoluntary The approaches that will be most effective in EDpractice should be determined by studying the implementation ofthese strategies in actual ED clinical practices Studies of thetranslation of efficacious research practice into clinical practiceis needed most since screening instruments have been used byresearch staff and not clinical staffImpact of screeningED patient care should be improved by implementing alcoholscreening programs A major limit to realizing this improvement isthe lack of counseling available to address patients alcoholproblems in most EDsMost EDs provide very limited alcohol services When care isunavailable screening makes little sense to clinicians Realizinga gain from screening in an ED is entirely dependent upon linkingthe screening program to some form of counseling onsite or throughreferral services The impact of screening should be demonstratedin ED environments that have treatment available an adequatevolume of alcoholinvolved patients and the capacity to undertakeclinical trials Studies in these centers should demonstrate thebenefits of screening increased referrals more patients receivingcounseling and better outcomes such as reduction of riskbehaviorsSummary research areas of interest concerning screeningThe ideal screen that is accurate practical and motivationalhas not been developed Researchers must continue to analyze theperformance of structured questionnaires and try computerbasedscreening tools in the ED The sequence of screening tests needs tobe evaluated by studying the NIAAA approach and severalalternatives Screening must move from research to clinicalpractice Barriers to screening in clinical practice must beidentified and removed Studies of implementation of screeningprograms in ED clinical practice should be undertaken The impactof screening on referral and intervention as well as outcomes suchas reduced risk behaviors must be
