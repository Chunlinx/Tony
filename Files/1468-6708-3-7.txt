                    Background        With the publication of the Antihypertensive and        LipidLowering Treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial        ALLHAT the role of peripheral alpha antagonists in the        treatment of hypertension has become controversial The        doxazosin arm of ALLHAT was stopped early due to a        doubling of the incidence of congestive heart failure in        this group as compared to the lowdose chlorthalidone arm            Prior to this publication there had been no        obvious suggestion of a mechanism by which peripheral        alpha antagonists in general or doxazosin in particular        would be inferior to chlorthalidone or would specifically        cause CHF Because ALLHAT is an activecontrol trial no        inferences can be made on whether this increased incidence        of CHF results from a harmful effect of doxazosin a        beneficial effect of chlorthalidone or both Nonetheless        there has been a large body of literature dedicated to the        positive effects of peripheral alpha antagonists on        surrogate endpoints such as cholesterol levels and        tolerability In light of the results of ALLHAT we        performed a review of the literature on doxazosin        terazosin and prazosin                    Methods        Medline and the Cochrane databases were used to identify        Englishlanguage papers on peripheral alpha antagonists        in studies targeting cardiovascular endpoints background        physiologic literature or any studies suggesting        mechanisms leading to an inferior performance in        cardiovascular endpoints Medline was searched from  to        the present with the key words doxazosin prazosin        terazosin adrenergic alphaantagonists or alpha        blocker The search was then limited to clinical trials        that had hypertension as a key word Studies were        included in our review if they addressed either one or a        combination of the three agents as the main focus in the        context of hypertension therapy and if they in some way        addressed the outcomes of interest noted above Relevant        data from these studies are reported descriptively Other        relevant references were acquired from bibliographic        searches                    Results                  Use in Hypertension and Prostatism          Evidence suggests that alpha antagonists are          frequently prescribed for hypertension but there are few          published data concerning the prevalence of the routine          use of peripheral alpha antagonists the prevalence          according to comorbid conditions such as benign          prostatic hypertrophy and the usual duration of therapy          In the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on          Prevention Detection Evaluation and Treatment of High          Blood Pressure JNC VI peripheral alpha antagonists          are recommended not only as secondline antihypertensive          therapy after lowdose diuretics and beta blockers but          also for specific indications such as therapy in men with          hypertension and prostatism     Alpha antagonists          represent effective therapy for prostatism and fifty          percent of men have histologic evidence of BPH by           years of age      The National Ambulatory Medical          Care Survey reported that the number of people on any          type of peripheral alpha antagonist in  was          approximately  to  of those with hypertension              About  of surveyed physicians would choose these drugs          as a firstline blood pressure agent for patients with          hypertension and symptoms of BPH                              Weight and Fluid Status          Peripheral alpha antagonists were consistently          associated with fluid retention A  study of prazosin          reported by Bauer revealed increases in plasma volume          interstitial fluid volume and extracellular fluid volume          following both shortterm and longterm therapy              In this study of  hypertensive men there was a          significant  L average increase in ECFV with a  mL          average increase in plasma volume measured with          radioisotopic assays that occurred within  weeks of          initiation lasted during  to  months of chronic          therapy and was still present during a twoweek washout          period There was no weight change in that study but two          other studies demonstrated both an increase in weight as          well as laboratory changes consistent with volume          expansion for prazosin      Bauer and his colleagues          suggested that a net increase in total body sodium from          an acute renal effect of prazosin was offset by a          decrease in actual body weight They also demonstrated          that the fractional excretion of sodium was unchanged          during treatment and further suggested that the acute          changes were followed by chronic sodium homeostasis and          maintenance of the increased total body sodium          The VA Cooperative Study on Antihypertensive agents          was a doubleblind randomized controlled trial comparing          atenolol captopril clonidine diltiazem          hydrochlorothiazide prazosin and placebo for          differences in antihypertensive efficacy in  men who          had mild diastolic hypertension     A highly          significant weight gain of  kilogram was observed at           weeks with prazosin compared to baseline p            and this gain was also statistically significant when          compared to the week weight changes in all other groups          that had experienced either weight loss or no mean weight          change p   The prazosin arm had the highest          rate of adverse effects leading to discontinuation of          treatment The termination rate of  was higher than          the termination rate from adverse effects for clonidine           and significantly higher than the rates for          captopril  atenolol  or hydrochlorothiazide               The number of men treated with prazosin          decreased from  at the beginning of the trial to  by          the end The average weight gain of  kilograms from          baseline was no longer statistically significant at one          year of therapy when compared to the original baseline          weight or the other therapies          Safety and tolerability trials with terazosin have          shown similar results Table  Patients treated with          terazosin tended to gain about  kilogram from baseline          on active therapy during these trials and those on          placebo therapy lost weight Two of the randomized trials          included a phase for withdrawal from active therapy with          weight information reported by Ruoff     Withdrawal          from active therapy was associated with a loss of           kilograms          Doxazosin has also been associated with volume          expansion A physiology study reported by LundJohansen          demonstrated a plasma volume fluid expansion of about           when compared to baseline values     Larger          randomized controlled trials have also consistently          demonstrated that patients treated with doxazosin gain          weight as summarized in Table  While patients treated          with doxazosin tend to gain weight patients on placebo          therapy lost weight The Treatment of Mild Hypertension          Study TOMHS trial is a notable exception for the trend          towards weight gain     All five treatment groups          and the placebo group received intensive dietary          counseling aimed at weight loss and all groups lost          weight without significant differences between trial          arms                          Neurohormonal and Cellular Effects          Physiologic studies with small numbers of participants          are by nature underpowered to detect meaningful          population differences but may provide a starting point          when such data are not available Peripheral alpha          antagonists were associated with perturbations in          neurohormonal levels in various studies In particular          peripheral alpha antagonists are associated with an          increase in plasma norepinephrine in diverse patient          populations as summarized in Table  This table          reflects increases in norepinephrine in normotensive          patients hypertensive patients and patients with          chronic congestive heart failure from a variety of these          small studies          Several lines of evidence suggest that elevated          catecholamine levels are cardiotoxic     Elevated          plasma norepinephrine levels are hypothesized to cause          direct myocardial damage through many mechanisms which          may be amplified by concomitant alpha blockade In          rats norepinephrine stimulates apoptosis which is          mediated through beta receptors     In addition          alpha cardiac receptors inhibit this response in rat          myocytes     The increased concentration of          norepinephrine leading to cardiac beta receptor          stimulation combined with alpha receptor inhibition may          lead to increased apoptosis in myocytes          Other hormones that are associated with cardiovascular          disease are affected by peripheral alpha antagonists          Endothelin is a vascular hormone which may play a role          in the generation and maintenance of heart failure              In hypertensive patients doxazosin lowers von          Willebrand factor commensurate with blood pressure but          it does not lower high levels of endothelin while          atenolol does              Other mechanisms for cellular injury have been          suggested Hooper proposed that peripheral alpha          antagonists alter cellular repair mechanisms possibly          causing cardiac damage He noted that prazosin blocks          heat shock protein expression in myocardium and it has          been hypothesized that this may leave myocardium more          vulnerable to injury                              Epidemiological and Clinical Trial Data          Between  and  there were  published          cardiovascular randomized controlled trials related to          the treatment of hypertension with the use of peripheral          alpha antagonists Among these only ALLHAT          specifically assessed differences in cardiovascular          endpoints resulting from control of hypertension with a          peripheral alpha antagonist Most of these trials          focused on surrogate endpoints such as equivalence of          bloodpressure reduction and effects on cholesterol          Other studies focused on tolerability and pharmacology          There are no case control cohort or other studies that          analyzed the impact of these agents on cardiovascular          endpoints Using data from other trials may offer a          partial framework for the interpretation of newer          findings          ALLHAT demonstrated a highly statistically          significant near doubling in the incidence of heart          failure in the doxazosin arm compared to heart failure          occurrences in the chlorthalidone arm Although there was          no difference in the primary outcome of CHD or the          secondary outcome of total mortality there were small          but statistically significant increases in the secondary          outcomes of angina RR   CI  and stroke          RR   CI  Since ALLHAT is a          comparative trial we know that doxazosin is associated          with more adverse cardiovascular outcomes than lowdose          chlorthalidone but we do not know how doxazosin might          compare with placebo The SHEP trial however does          provide a comparison between chlorthalidone and placebo          therapy for a reference point of heart failure although          the study populations have different demographic and          blood pressure distributions     The SHEP trial          included  people aged  and older who had a          systolic blood pressure of  to  mmHg and a          diastolic blood pressure of less than  mmHg Subjects          were randomized to lowdose diuretics or placebo and          were followed for an average of  years for major CV          events Comparisons between those randomized to active          therapy and those on placebo demonstrated nearly a           reduction in fatal and nonfatal heart failure events RR            CI  The rates of CHF in SHEP          participants treated with diuretics and placebo were           and  per  personyears respectively In          comparison the rates of CHF in ALLHAT participants          treated with diuretics and doxazosin were  and  per           personyears respectively If lowdose          chlorthalidone has a similar risk reduction in the ALLHAT          population and halves the incidence of clinical heart          failure events compared to no therapy the effect of          doxazosin would be comparable to that of the placebo arm          in the SHEP trial                            Conclusions        The report of the doxazosin arm termination in ALLHAT        was published in April  At that time the results of        the ALLHAT trial were unexpected given the potential        association between high dose diuretics and the risk of        sudden death     and the favorable effect of        peripheral alpha antagonists on lipid profiles            Comparing data from other studies suggests the possibility        that the beneficial effects of peripheral alpha        antagonists for lowering blood pressure may be nullified by        a negative effect or that other antihypertensives have        positive actions beyond their antihypertensive effects        Those treated with doxazosin in ALLHAT had a mean blood        pressure that was  to  mmHg higher than the mean blood        pressure of those treated with chlorthalidone Based on        Framingham Heart Study logistic regression coefficients        this  to  mmHg difference in systolic blood pressure is        associated with an increased relative risk of only  to             From available data it appears that this        average difference in systolic blood pressure is not large        enough to double the average incidence of CHF        The literature suggests several mechanisms by which        peripheral alpha antagonists in general and doxazosin in        particular might prove inferior to other types of        antihypertensive therapy They are associated with a mild        volume expansion which may precipitate the clinical        presentation of heart failure in those with subclinical        disease If this is the mechanism responsible for        increasing the incidence of CHF in the ALLHAT trial it        would be consistent with the early divergence of the        KaplanMeier curves in that study        Peripheral alpha antagonists also cause neurohormonal        changes during chronic therapy The longterm ramifications        of these changes for patients being treated for        hypertension are not known These drugs appear to cause        increases in norepinephrine and this increase may nullify        the beneficial effect of lowered blood pressure on the        occurrence of CHF Not only are increased plasma        catecholamines a central feature in heart failure they are        now a recommended target for effective lifeprolonging        therapy              Given that doxazosin is not as effective as        chlorthalidone in reducing the cardiovascular complications        of hypertension several questions remain There is still a        paucity of information regarding the absolute risk        reduction for clinical heart failure or other        cardiovascular events afforded by peripheral alpha        antagonists in a variety of populations Differentiation of        the mechanism for reduced protection compared to diuretics        would be interesting but difficult to accomplish For heart        failure in particular the increase in symptomatic episodes        of CHF may be due to hemodynamic effects of doxazosin        unmasking incipient heart failure direct myocardial        injury or both Chronic volume loading may not only unmask        subclinical ventricular dysfunction but may possibly        contribute to worsening ventricular function over time        Whatever mechanisms were responsible for the heart        failure findings in ALLHAT the results support the current        national recommendations to use lowdose diuretics or        betablockers as first line agents for the pharmacologic        treatment
