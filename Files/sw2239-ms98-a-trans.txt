        hi Chris this is Carol   hi   this is interesting uh question come up here uh proposal for people to young people to spend a year or two in the Peace Corps um or something like that doing public service i   or doing or doing public service   suppose the idea is to um i dont know but but the point be to that get   well in order to go in order to join the Peace Corps you have to have a college degree and so that eliminates a lot of people from that and doing public service how are they supposed to support themselves   it sure does yeah i i i suppose the idea the idea would be to get um people interested in public service and to um i dont know maybe people give give people give young people an appreciation for maybe what they have and what other people dont have   well yeah i think thats a good idea although i dont i think if its something thats forced on you   um   um i think that the attitude is not going to be quite the same   well i tend to agree and um uh in that we do live in the United States and i think one of our uh one of the things that our country is based on is freedom of choice   yeah   um forcing someone to give up a couple years of their life uh doing something that may not be or the timing that they want to do it or uh perhaps even you know maybe they would have something something else just just the idea of forcing someone to do something i im pretty much against that   yeah from what ive read most people in the United States do do some type of volunteer work at some time in their lives   just on their own umhum   but i right but i agree it has to be at their choice and it needs to be a time when theyre ready to do it um i dont think you can just snatch somebody away from you know you dont know what their circumstances are or whats going on in their life you cant just snatch them away and make them go do something they dont want to do     thats right     sort of like the draft   i think there would be an awful lot of resentment and um i i really dont think it would be feasible on our country   then that raises a question of how you know are you going to pay them or are you going to provide them with you know place to live and food to eat and whether they have a family you know   thats right yeah some young people do some young people start families young and or maybe are responsible for their parents   yeah thats true thats true   brothers and sisters things like that i suppose they may have exceptions but um i guess it all it would all boil down to i mainly i i guess my question would be what whats the purpose whats whats trying to be accomplished by by that proposal   im not sure im not sure if its a way to cut down government expenses or its like you said thats something more you know to to make people aware   umhum more esoteric   yeah whats going on and what needs to be done but i really do think that the population that people are pretty well aware i think more so now than ever before   you know i think thats true and i i tend to think that our children are also growing up with a bit more awareness of that at least i mean i i feel i try to as an individual my children are very young but   yeah   um i i think theyre being taught a lot maybe to be more responsible   umhum   and um hopefully to understand that everyone is not as in as fortunate   yeah   as as perhaps they are   yeah yeah and i think that thats the trend now i think thats the trend now and i think people are a lot more willing to give of their time   pardon me   and help out   you know its also seems to me if someone does it on a volunteer basis then they will probably put a lot more into it than if they were forced um   yeah and get and get more out of it   thats right   so i think we or  sounds like we pretty much agree   yeah its an interesting idea but i think we do agree and at least im im i dont think i would vote for it if it came down to that   no i dont think i would either   maybe just do our best to to do our own fair share and   do what you can when you can right then as long as you feel good about yourself and what youre doing to help i think thats more important than       thats right       well its been nice talking to you about it i have to admit its something i hadnt thought of before it it is interesting to think about it   nice talking yeah really well it does kind of catch you by surprise   yes     okay well thanks   okay well talk to you later byebye   byebye
