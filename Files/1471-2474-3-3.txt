                    Background        The knee is one of the most commonly injured joints The        stability of the knee is dependent on several muscles the        meniscus and four major ligaments These knee ligaments are        the medial collateral ligament MCL the lateral        collateral ligament LCL the anterior cruciate ligament        ACL and the posterior cruciate ligament PCL        The effect of strain rate on the failure modes of the        boneligamentbone complex has been investigated There are        three failure mechanisms      The first is        midsubstance tearing in which the fibers of the ligament        pull apart in the tissue generally during a fast loading        rate The second mode is ligamentbone interface failure in        which the fibers fail at the ligamentbone insertion        without fracture of the underlying bone The final mode is        tibia or femoral avulsion fractures usually occurring        during relatively slow loading rates             Ligaments and bone have nonlinear time and        historydependent viscoelastic properties These properties        can be expressed in terms of stressstrain relationships        with rate as an additional parameter Figure and show        typical stressstrain relationships of the ligament and        bone respectively For the ligament the slope of the        stressstrain curve becomes nearly constant in the        prefailure phase The curve is composed of four regions        toe linear failure and complete failure               The ligament failure mode varies with different types of        ligament ACL PCL MCL and LCL due to their different        viscosities     Bone also has nonlinear behavior and        the elastic modulus is higher in bone than in ligament                   Stress MPa  is defined as the intensity of internal        force over the unit crosssectional area of the original        specimen     The definition of strain  or mm  is        the change in length of the specimen divided by its        initial length     Strain with percentage units is        obtained by multiplying the mm form by  The strain        rate represents the change in elongation with time            The extension or deformation rate msec of the specimen        divided by its initial length m gives the strain rate as        does the rate of change of the strain itself d  dt Its        unit is sec or simply sec  Unfortunately not all of        these parameters or overall dimensions are always given        so that reported deformation rates cannot be converted into        strain rates or vice versa In addition strain rates data        alone does not allow calculations of failure load since        neither direct force nor effective mass are typically        reported        The electronic version of Medline was used to identify        articles for this review The keywords used for were strain        rate knee injury and ligament From the result of this        search all involving strainrate experiments of the        boneligamentbone complex were further considered Papers        with only one boneligament attachment were excluded as        were those with only relative strain rates The selected        papers were further limited to those reporting quantified        strain rates and the specific nature of the failures        There are many recent studies on the effect of the        strain rate on the failure mode of the knee                    These are summarized in Table  The        results of most studies show that at low strain rates        avulsion occurs at the ligament insertion site on the bone        or the bone itself may fail At high strain rate it is        generally reported that the ligament tears                    However the definitions of a fast or slow        rate and the actual rate range covered in each study are        different In addition the orientation of the        boneligamentbone complex during testing may also affect        the results but details of this orientation are not        typically provided        Viidik         et al studied the effects of        training in a running machine on rabbits They showed the        weakest point in the tibialigamentfemur system to be one        of the bony attachments most often the tibial one                   In a Noyes         et al used rhesus monkeys to        investigate the effect of strain rate changes on the        failure mode The approximate strain rates were  sec        at the slow rate and  sec at the fast rate        Ligament tearing happened more at the fast strain rate        with bone avulsion occurring more at the slow strain rate            They also analyzed the effects of activity on        ligament failure using the strain rate of  sec            This study showed   ligament tearing in the control        group  ligament tearing and  bony avulsion with         weeks of immobilization   ligament tearing and  bony        avulsion from an exercise group and   ligament tearing        from a reconditioning group            Alm         et al used a  mmsec deformation        rate on Beagle dogs to study the strength of the ACL The        mid part of the ligament ruptured in  of the tests                   Crownishield         et al tested failure characteristics        of the MCL of rats at strain rates of            and  sec As the strain rate increased        ligament tearing occurred more than avulsion These authors        described the range of injury strain rates in man as from        approximately  sec to  sec            Kennedy         et al conducted ultimate failure        strengths of the ACL at the strain rates of  and         sec The ages of the human specimens ranged from  to         years with a mean of  years The major mode of failure        was ligament tearing at both of the strain rates                   In  Noyes         et al evaluated the strength of the        ACL in humans and rhesus monkeys to analyze age and species        related changes The age range of the human specimens was        from  to  years for an older group and from  to         years for a younger group The rhesus monkeys were  years        old For the human specimens a strain rate of sec was        used for both old and young specimens A strain rate of         sec was used for the monkeys Ligament tearing was        predominant in the specimens from younger humans and from        rhesus monkeys Avulsion of bone beneath the ligament        insertion site was seen for the older humans            Woo         et al studied the effect of strain        rate on MCL failures in skeletally immature and mature        rabbits The range of strain rate used was from  to         sec Tibia avulsion developed in all specimens from        skeletally immature rabbits with the strain rate from         to  sec Results for this group were not reported        above  sec However ligament tearing occurred from        skeletally mature rabbits with the strain rate from         to  sec            Schenck         et al investigated two clinically        applicable stain rates  and  sec to study human        ACL and PCL hyperextension In the PCL ligament tearing        occurred at the lower stain rate where as bone avulsion        occurred at the higher strain rate The order of these        results is contrary to that of most of the other studies        In the ACL the major failure mode at the low stain rate        was similar to the PCL with a mixed failure pattern at the        higher strain rate            The scope of these studies covers a very wide range of        strain rates multiple species various ages and in some        cases direct intervention Given this diverse set of        results a mathematical model of ligament and bony insert        behavior was developed to provide an integrated        understanding of the reported variations in failure        mode                    Methods                  Qualitative          We present a qualitative analytical model to analyze          and explain these various results The model takes into          account the individual rate sensitivity of the strength          of both the ligament and the bony insertion points This          provides an integrated view of the strength and failure          mode of the combined system As the strain rate          increases the stiffness and peak failure loads of the          ligament and bone both increase       Fig shows          the relationship between the ultimate stress and strain          for bone alone and ligament alone with loading rates          While the exact mechanisms of these changes are not well          understood the effect of strain rate on the          stressstrain curves is produced in part by internal          viscosity and energy dissipation     Individually          these properties can be viewed as providing a protective          mechanism under many circumstances in that they make the          joint stiffer and stronger at high loading rates at          least up to their strength limits When reported failure          modes are considered for the boneligamentbone complex          the effect of the changing strain rate on the bone must          be greater than that on the ligament          Failure mode I represents the situation in which bone          avulsion occurs preferentially over ligament tearing The          ultimate failure stress of both bone and ligament            ult B             ult L  is relatively small at these          strain rates compared to the strengths at higher loading          rates The strength of the ligament at these rates is          generally greater than the strength of bone Therefore          the bony avulsion failure is more common at low strain          rates because the bone failure point is reached first          The use of stress as the controlling parameter is based          on the assumption of a ligament of uniform area and an          equal effective bone insertion area Alternatively the          discussion could be based on load rather than stress          without changing the general argument          Failure mode II is the case of bony avulsion or          ligament tearing occurring at similar frequency ie          where the ultimate stress of bone and ligament are          similar across the population This mode occurs at higher          strain rates than those of mode I While both ligament          and bone insertion strengths are larger than those in          mode I at these larger stain rates the strengths of the          ligament and the insertion approach equality Because          there is not a clearly preferred type of failure in mode          II which failure occurs is likely defined more by          individual variation than by fundamental          biomechanics          Failure mode III occurs at higher strain rates in          which ligament tearing predominates over bone avulsion          As the strain rate increases further above that of mode          II the ultimate stress of bone and ligament continue to          increase but now the strength of the bone becomes          stronger than that of the ligament                When the strain rate increases overwhelmingly over          that of mode III the ultimate stress of bone stays about          the same as in mode III but the ultimate stress of the          ligament increases over that of mode III Failure mode I          show again Also failure mode II represents as the          strain rate increases more than that of mode I Fig          represents modes I II III I and II                          Quantitative          We use the Kelvin model as a conceptual representation          for describing the individual behavior of both the          ligament and the bone as a function of loading rate The          Kelvin model is composed of a spring and dashpot element          arranged in parallel Fig           The total stress in each system is                              where           E is the respective Youngs modulus          or the modulus of elasticity  is the respective          coefficient of viscosity and            t  are the respective strains and          strain rates          To model the effect of constant strain rate is set to          a constant value denoted by  From this equation  can          be written as                    Fig represents that stress and strain in the          ligament have a linear relationship under the conditions          shown in equation  While this is not the usually          quoted result it must be remembered that here this is          under the specific condition of constant strain rate          loading When the strain rate increases the slope of this          curve also increases These equations describe the effect          of strain rate on ligament performance although a          failure point still has to be specified          Neglecting the inertia term for the ligament a          balance of forces requires that the bone stress            B            t  be equal to the ligament stress                     L            t  for constant area Therefore          it is possible to solve for the strain            B            t  from equation  and                     The final equation is following                    While the strain            L            t  is only the given function of          time the strain            B            t  is a function of time and          constant terms related to both bone and ligament          properties                            Results        The failure modes were used to analyze the studies of        Table and restate the results as shown in Table         In Viidik         et al the failures are predominately        mode I Even though training had some positive effect on        insertion point strength this effect was not great enough        to make          ult B           ult L and therefore avulsion remained        the primary cause of failure        Noyes         et al in a and b studied        the ACL failure mode of Rhesus monkeys The first study        shows mode I at slow strain rate and mode III at fast        strain rate The mixed results suggest operation in the        mode II region with significant individual variability In        the second Noyes         et als study mode III predominates        Assuming immobilization reduces strength          ult B reduced more than          ult L  so that they approached        equality In exercise either          ult B and          ult L is not significantly affected or        they both may increase without significant relative        changes In the latter case the analysis is limited by the        lack of information actual failure loads or stresses Even        though changing their relative value this effect is        consistent with Viidik         et al The reconditioning after        immobilization suggest that reconditioning has a much        greater effect on          ult L  such that          ult L comes to exceed          ult B and the failure changes to mode        III Fig illustrates the changed in the ultimate stress        of bone and ligament depending on the effect of activity as        reported by Noyes         et al b        Kennedy         et al and Noyes         et al in  studied ACL failure in        human specimens Even though different strain rates were        used mode III applies to both strain rates in Kennedy In        the age range from  to  years          ult B           ult L  The strain rates used dont        affect the relative value of          ult B and          ult L  However we have different        results in Noyes         et als study The older         years and younger group  years data fit mode I with                 ult B           ult L and III with          ult B           ult L respectively Assuming aging        reduces strength          ult B reduced more than          ult L  The Rhesus monkeys group had        the same failure mode as the younger group These results        demonstrate that strain rate alone is not the defining        parameter Analytically this would be reflected by E         and          ult being a function of age and other        conditions        In Crownishield         et als rabbit specimens like Noyes                et als study increasing the strain        rate caused a shift from mode I to II to III The MCL        study of Woo et al is similar to Crownishield et al        except for the range of strain rate Mode I applies to the        immature group for all strain rates and mode III to mature        group for all strain rates Maturing increases strength        presumably more so for bone than ligament and causing          ult B           ult L  The effect of the strain rates        used in each group is not seen probably because they are        not sufficiently different        Schenck         et al reported their results as        different from previous studies but this is not clear        given the variation in specimens and strain rates used        Therefore the results of the effect of strain rate for the        PCL and ACL were reverse from those of the previous        studies using strain rates intended to correlate        differences between sporting and trauma     However        only one other study Crownnishield         et al using the rat MCL used strain        rates as high or higher than Schenck         et als fast rate Accepting that        the rate and human results are consistent Schenck         et als results suggest that the        relative effect of stain rate on strength has a second        cross over point Fig shows this relationship                    Discussion        The effect of the strain rate on the failure modes of        the boneligamentbone complex is an important factor in        knee joint injury We have defined five ranges of failure        as a function of strain rate and other parameters Avulsion        happens more than ligament tearing in mode I which is        primarily associated with low strain rates The number of        avulsion is comparable with the number of ligament tears in        mode II where individual variation is the dominant effect        Ligament tearing occurs more than bony avulsion in mode III        that is associated with high strain rates Finally at very        high strain rates the continued attraction in bone and        ligament strength again causes the ligament to become        stronger than bone Thus mode I and mode II can be defined        based on strain rates The integrative concept for these        failure modes is that both bone and ligament strengths        increase with increasing strain rates and that these are        at least two points at which these functions cross These        results have important implications with respect to further        experimental studies in this area It is critical that        strain rates be carefully defined and that comparisons        with other work be made on the basis of similar values        rather than just high and low Secondly species age        condition and other variables compound the difficulty of        drawing broad conclusions as does the lack of detail on        orientation of the boneligamentbone complex during        testing
