        how do you get your current events are you a po couch potato or     well actually no uh its its multifaceted for me since im married to a news junkie   oh is that right   uh yeah we we get the you know about three papers a day plus theres four different newscasts that we watch and of course if theres nothing else um worth doing or watching on television well watch either headline news or CNN itself and uh plus im a member of a an electronic community and i get a lot of news that way so uh   umhum   its really pretty hard to not be informed   thats right yeah   how about yourself   well i start out the day listening to the radio on my you know as im getting ready for work and in the evenings and and im in a vacuum all day except what news i get electronically we have uh electronic news at work   uhhuh   uh the lunch table discussion usually brings up a few things that people have seen in the paper that morning and i havent had time to read   yeah   and uh some more radio on the way home and its usually too late to watch the news by the time i get home but i can uh read the newspaper then the morning news of course   umhum and of course everythings changed by that time and   and oh of course of course and then uh the ten oclock news at bedtime   umhum   so thats about it i dont have cable TV now i used to do like you did and the default was CNN   uhhuh   you know and i could just id have that thing going for hours   yeah they really have some fascinating stuff especially on the weekends uh we kind of uh we kind of like CNBC i dont know if youve ever seen it but its a its a cable well you dont have cable cable NBC   hum   and its sort of like uh National Public Radio on cable television   oh wow   so they go into all sorts of neat little off the wall kind of topics that you normally wouldnt get in uh in uh  in a conventional news broadcast or even on CNN its sort of like socketed little special interest kinds of things and its really fascinating to see you know theyre out there covering it um one thing i wanted to ask you about was the youre you said youre in Dallas the quality of your local papers do you do you see   umhum   pandering because     well the the most noticeable thing about our two local papers is that we now have one local paper   uh no   The The Times Herald went out of business       it was always the weak sister of the two   okay   uh and the Morning News uh managed somehow to acquire nearly all the comics and features that the Times Herald had been carrying   uhhuh   so i mean they just they just plundered  the poor Times Herald i mean it was financial you can blame the syndicates for going where theyre you know they got bigger bucks or whatever   yeah well see were a Gannett city   umhum   and uh the Democrat and Chronicles and Times Union are our papers and a a few years ago they merged editorial boards however they still continue to publish they put out three additions well its actually DNC puts out two one in the morning And the Times Union puts out two but theyre virtually the same paper   umhum   theres an theres an evening edition which comes out at noon and and the late edition which comes out at three       and just to give you an idea of what i meant by pandering its like sometimes they their news for the news for the incredible stupid or comatose   wow   the past two days the headlines have been massive storm hits area       and its like   in case youre brain dead   well you know oh well that explains all the snow you know  as if someone was worried about it i just you know i i have to wonder uh   yeah   uh how how well theyre serving us because uh you you theyve theyve got a lock on it they dont theres not that many theres a few alternative newspapers but they all all the alternative newspapers have this sort of an underground feel to them   uhhuh   and you you know you really cant trust them theyre not i i think i need conservatism from my news i dont know im funny   yeah just the facts please   yeah just the facts and and i dont want really much of a slant on it at all i just want the news   yeah   you know i dont want uh someone judging the news for me   that one of the most famous headlines and i think this was on the editorial page and i dont remember it exactly of the Dallas Morning News was was some story about how well people can read and the fact that they cant and the headline was something like Lets Ban Literacy and wait a minute that sounds fine at first they want to ban illiteracy i think think   i think so Lets Ban Literacy but thats going to put you guys out of business dont you think     thats right
