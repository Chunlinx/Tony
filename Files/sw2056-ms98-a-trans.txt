        all right do you have any kids   okay no   ive got two and it is hard to find day care for them   what um what do you think needs to be the criteria set for those   oh   what would you like to see in one   well i ive seen the bad side in most of them   uhhuh   i took my son to a day care one time when he was just  you know just uh not even three months old and uh you know it was a desperate thing and uh when my husband went to pick him up she he said that the baby had been crying the whole time he was asleep but you know how they cry in their sleep   yeah   and uh you know this uh couldnt catch his breath even in his sleep and that turned me off of day cares   i bet   and then when i took uh ive seen these kids that uh its a church volleyball they have a day care set up there for people playing volleyball and uh one of the girls was real mean to the kid   uhhuh hm   and that was you know he shed just she had treated him like family does you know and um   yeah   it you know it uh i know most of the girls up there and the ones that keeps my kids are real good uh my son doesnt like people too much   yeah   but uh when when we leave there he uh gives the girl a hug and tells her ill miss you so you know   oh well thats good   so i know they treat him good   yeah   uh   is it i dont know maybe would you think a better student to teacher ratio do they have too many kids in most day cares for the people they have   yeah yeah uh i dont know much about day cares itself you know uh you know this is more of just the nursery for three and under   umhum   and uh theres only theres two people taking care of about five kids uh where im where im taking my two   uhhuh   and but uh in most places yeah they got forty five kids at best i guess   oh my goodness   you know and maybe about four teachers and thats a lot of kids   yeah um we dont yeah we dont have any but we have you know plenty of sisters and brothers that that have them and   uh   im not sure that there is a solution to that as far as uh the day there you know everybody has in their mind the kind of day care that they want but it seems you know that theres not really the perfect one out there   no theres not nobody can take care of your kids better than you   right and thats not even possible anymore i dont think to be able to take care of your own kids without you know with everybody working these days   well i had to quit my job because of uh my my two you know uh day care wise or babysittingwise and stuff uh because you know my sister was keeping them uh uh we just lucked out and she uh met a military man who lived down here and we came down here for TI   uhhuh   and uh so i had her baby sitting but she was six months pregnant and it was getting too much for her so i just quit id rather quit and take care of my own kids than let somebody else raise them   oh yeah yeah that seems probably the best way to do it   well you know theyre getting raised right   yeah yeah um i havent really the only day cares that i have been familiar with are the ones that are local here with the churches and they seem to from my experience be the best at what theyre doing just because of what theyre based on   yeah yeah if um i i know one church that uh there was some problems with but that was just uh basically a personal problem between the mother and the uh person that was taking in charge   oh   but uh the church uh day care that my kids uh they dont go to a day care you know its uh during Sunday School and stuff uh the people there are really nice   uhhuh yeah yeah i think i think thats thats important   yeah well they i think its one of the important things   umhum   if uh because if they dont like it uh you cant get them that separation thing and i need that my kids i need to cut the strings on them theyre not very old but   yeah how old are they   three and uh four and two   oh   so you know theyre theyre good kids you know they do bad things but theyre good kids   umhum but you know kids kids do those   yeah uh but i dont like the punishment the day care does you know i dont know exactly what they do but i dont want no one punishing my kids but myself   uhhuh right   and thats another problem with day care because youre not there so you dont what theyre doing   right right   and if   yeah theyre probably i would think needs to be i dont know if they have any type of uh formal or informal spontaneous or routine drop ins of agencies you know people checking up on like they do nursing homes you know they drop in to see if youre meeting all of the requirements by law and and i think they need to do that with day cares and just see whats going on   yeah thats thats thats something that should be brought up with these people   so but im not really sure   i dont know if they do it either to be truthful   yeah i dont either its not until you have kids i guess you worry about those things   well uh       with me i just decided not to face it and you know in most in in so many words you know in one way or the other i just decided not to face that issue and i just keep them with me   yeah uhhuh well i dont know what weve done to solve any of this  but ive enjoyed talking with you     yeah so have i oh   and welcome to Texas   oh well thanks and i guess i weve weve been on long enough so you have a good day all right byebye   thank you byebye
