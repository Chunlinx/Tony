                              The Language of the Law            The thesis of this work is that most legal communicationcan and should be expressed in ordinarywords the subtext is that although the law isa profession of words most lawyers do not knowmuch about them and very few are interested inlearning more  After a short introductory sectionhalf the book is devoted to a history of legal language and the other half to a critical analysis of itsusage  The latter half will have more appeal to theaverage lawyer unscholarly primate that he is butthe languageloving lawyer which many are and allought to be will be entertained as much as edifiedby the eventful chronicle of the forging and temperingof the tools of his trade  Of all specialized vocabulariesthat of the law is not only the most commonlyused but by far the most eloquent andalluring  For that reason and because they will relishthe authors excoriating criticism of the shamanisticrhetoric employed by lawyers to intimidatethem lay people who are addicted to the lore ofwords will find the book as a whole not less fascinatingthan do the practitioners            The first half is a piece of scholarship par excellenceso closely packed and fully realized that nosummary can begin to do it justice  I shall try toreduce its gist to a few paragraphs of my own words            The history of the legal language of the Englishspeakingcommon law countries and the history ofthe English language are indissoluble  The Celtsthose ancient invaders from the continent who managedto survive the Roman occupation and resist theLatin tongue contributed one word whiskey having legal significance but were driven along withtheir reverseorder speech into the nooks and cornersof the British Isles and France by the fierce AnglesSaxons and Jutes wielding their broadswordsand brutish monosyllables  The Law impressed aspecial meaning on many AngloSaxon words manslaughtersheriff theft hearsay bench judgesstrike motion to landlord freehold in land andherein which they retain to this day  From theViking raids and settlements a few Norse words ofTeutonic ancestry survive with technical legal definitionsgift loan sale bond  and law itself            When in about the year  King thelbertpromulgated a written AngloSaxon code of law alittle cloud of Latin was rising from the sea  TheCeltic tongue later to be overwhelmed by AngloSaxoncontained only a few Latin words most ofthem place names and none of legal import outlivedthe occupation  But the speech of the AngloSaxonsthemselves had brought to England a sprinkling ofLatin words picked up in their trade with the Romans            At almost the same time that thelbert proclaimed his code St Augustine and his followers arrivedin England bringing Christianity and Latinand within a hundred years the conversation wascomplete  Latin through the clergy was widely introducedto the native idiom and took a strong positionin the law well before the Conquest  After theConquest English remained robustly alive during aperiod of bi and trilingualism the invadingNormans spoke a French dialect which became for atime the language of the kings and the nobilitywhile contemporary English was spoken by the indigenouspopulation Latin was the language of recordand of the law in general and so it remained forabout two centuries after the Conquest with Englishas a close second  English fastened upon foreignwords with gusto transforming and anglicizing themto lend grandeur and subtlety to the vernacular  Theupper classes were familiar with both French andEnglish the cultivated classes with Latin as well  Althougha statute of  required pleadings to be inEnglish and records in Latin French became theprincipal language of the law and of legal educationand so continued for  years although Latin remainedthe standard for the allimportant writsThere was nothing written in English of immediatepractical value to the practising common lawyer orlaw student  But the use of English spread and bythe end of the th century knowledge of Frenchwas an accomplishment  Indeed the hallmark ofauthenticity was put on it by Chaucer who seemedto be preparing it for Spenser Bacon Shakespeareand the other Elizabethans and for Donne Miltonand Dryden  Still French words in vast numbersboth of the law and of common speech continued tobe embraced by English and by  the law itselfjoined that embrace retaining French and Latinonly for technical terms            With the advance of literacy that came withprinting and the use of Latin as a scholarly linguafranca Bacon and Milton wrote in Latin as well as inEnglish  The lawyers already educated in Latin asthe learned tongue incorporated it almost completelyinto their writing and in large part into theiroral usage  To this day long after Latin has ceased tobe the principal medium of written legal documentsand records lawyers cling to and defend against allcomers unnumbered words and phrases in that ancienttongue under the persuasion justified or notthat they enrich the legal vocabulary with precisionpermanence and dignity            Anticipating our contemporary Plain Englishlaws strong voices were raised in the th centuryagainst the use of foreign tongues as a kind of blackart to mystify the uneducated and cheat them oftheir rights  Every man they said ought to be ableto understand the law and act on his own behalf  In and again in  Parliament passed lawswritten almost entirely in derivatives of French orLatin requiring that all court proceedings be inEnglish  Both laws were bitterly resisted by thebench and bar and because of such pressure thelater one was eviscerated before it went into effectby an amendment allowing the continued use of customarywords  This was an age of exiguous technicalityin English as well as Latin and French an agewhen the failure of a syllable lost the cause  Theland law was on the movein a solemn progressionof rules and technical evasions  This was the day ofthe ingenious conveyance the computers of the infinitelogical word slicers dealers in metaphysicalwraiths  The law was encased in a hard shellof fixed pattern its language determined by formsand the deadweight of precedent            American colonists particularly hostile to lawyersand their mumbojumbo tried at first simply toeliminate the profession  When that failed theyturned to the doityourself approach creating alively demand for selfinstruction books of theEveryman His Own Lawyer kind foreshadowing thepresentday will and estateplanning kits  Despitelawyers renunciations of such efforts as chimerasof ignorance and folly the public continuedandcontinues to this dayto yearn for simplicity            Law language it is generally agreed among laypeople with a few eccentric lawyers concurring isverbose pompous archaic and obscure  Applyinghis premise that it should agree with ordinaryspeech Professor Mellinkoff examines the reasonslawyers rely on for the difference            The lawyers first line of defence is precision  hisbounden duty to lay down his words so that theymay never be misunderstood  For this he must usethe finely turned jewelers tools of his craft not thecarpenters saws and hatchets of common idiomBut says the author the steeling grip of lawyers ontheir stilted language is in fact the result of fear Leave us alone  Dont change  Here we stay tilldeath or disbarment   When lawyers say precisionthey think they are saying exact meaning  but whatthey are in truth saying most of the time is exactlythesameway thatis the traditional way to haveand to hold  the way of precedent cause of actionand the required way as by statute  Suchusages may also be exact meanings  and thus trulyprecise  but they are not necessarily so  Lawyersstandbys such as aforesaid forthwith hereafterhereby herein hereinafter  and even the ubiquitoussaid are condemned by the author as tricky duckingbobbing words flabby words whose onlyclaim to precision is their traditional use not worthsaving  He also takes whacks at those old chestnutsandor and ss   Under the heaviest duress such as thethreat of boiling in ink lawyers might relinquish allthese but they will fight to the bitter end and finallydie at the barricades before surrendering theirwhereases   Never mind that the author saysWhereas is consistently vague meaning variouslythe fact is although considering that on thecontrary and that being the case with many shadingsin between  Generally appearing as the finalwhereas is the most fatuous and utterly redundantone of all WHEREAS the parties have orally agreedto the terms of such sale and desire to reducetheir agreement to writing Now THEREFOREThe lawyer is also habituated to doublets and tripletslike fit and proper force and effect give bequeathand devise null and void  and rest residueand remainder   These seem to me among the lessreprehensible for they are understandable to ordinarypeople and are objectionable mainly on thegrounds of repetition rather than obscurity  Morelegal documents than ever before contain laundrylist of such terms many from the computers memorybank often imparting false profundity and reassuranceto the client like the chant of the auctioneerbut under cold analysis shriveling to redundancy andconfusion  Never mind all this the lawyer will clingto them like the drunkard to his bottle            The reader is told that there was once justificationfor the term natural life eg sentencedto serve for the rest of his natural life tomy wife Nancy for and during her natural lifebased on the civil death of a felon and also upon thestate of civil death assumed by a monk upon his abnegationof all worldly concerns but that the phraseas now applied is outrageously redundant  Thesewords are so universally employed in deeds and willsthat the absence of natural might cause a reviewinglawyer to question the authorship  The criticism isnonetheless valid though this rejected phrase mightcome again into play where some sort of life as afterbrain death  is prolonged by totally artificial means            In targeting esoteric words used by lawyers inplace of ordinary ones under the pretense of precisionit seems to me that the author is wasting ammunitionon words like reasonable substantial  and satisfactory They are words of ordinary speech withwhich juries are quite comfortable and lawyers areas aware as everybody else that they are impreciseThe laws reasonable man  from the tribal wisdom ofa person who is honest and sensible is an image thatcan be called forth in the mind of every man  Substantialperformance is something a great deal morethan driving the first nail and a little less than drivingthe last one and it survives as a useful tool to preventinjustice by technicality  Reasonable doubt maybe a sows ear but the jury understands that thejudge is telling them to be damned sure the defendantis guilty before they hang him  These wordsexpress concepts that cannot be drawn with straightedgeand compass their flexibility is essential totheir function  The subjective satisfactory  and ordinaryword rather than a legal one is a troublemakerand should be avoided            Lawyers are mad folk in general but their madnesscrescendos according to Professor Mellinkoffin their consuming passion for precedent   Mesmerizedby the ritual phrase stare decisis  theydelve into that shelfdevouring monster of confusionknown as Words and Phrases and come forth withlanguage that the profession accepts as precedentthus investing such terms as accident and proximatecause with a false precision  Accident is indeed elusiveof enduring definition but a lawyer may find itvery useful to discover a purported definition in acase of his own jurisdiction decided upon facts resemblingthose at hand  Most lawyers accept proximatecause as a necessary term of art and will considerthe authors treatment of it as concisegibberish for which you can get a definition at anysupermarket as rather severe  It embodies a conceptdifficult to define the necessary nexus betweenthe act and the injury  We cannot go back to AdamsFall where we sinned all certainly neither can werequire that the safe fall directly on the plaintiffshead  Foreseeability  unmentioned by the author butindispensable in the application of proximate cause narrows but does not close the gap  The jurorsagain are free to move within a fenced area  Lawyerswill understand that the author is inveighingagainst precedent only as a false pretense for fakeprecision but an innocent layman straying intothese pages might well take it from the broadgaugedblasts that the whole doctrine of precedentis a grand illusion a sort of pseudoscience like astrologyin which lawyers and judges count the angelsdancing on the point of a needleFrom faltering beginnings in the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries the heapedup precedentsof the substantive my italics law swarmwith trivia with differences without substantivedistinction with repetitions that centuries ago attainedthe rank of platitude                        For the benefit of the uninitiated let me say thatlawyers deluded or not overwhelmingly believethat with the exception of constitutions and of statutesenacted by legislatures and rules under themprecedent is what the law is made of in the UnitedStates that the law existed before written languagein the tradition of customs that runneth not to thecontrary and continues to thrive in the printed decisionsthat the statutes themselves remain unsettleduntil rounded out by precedent that precedents maybecome so venerable as to become platitudes butmay also be as fresh as the undried ink on todaysappellate court decision and that when a lawyersearches for as recent a decision as he can find in ajurisdiction as near as possible on facts as close to hisclients case as possible never overruled or modifiedand pronouncing the law as clearly as possiblehe is doing what he should be doing and might wellbe guilty of malpractice for failing to do so            As an instance of the gross imprecision of precedentthe author cites a Kentucky case in which despitethe heavydrinking insureds answer Neverto a question in a life insurance application as to theuse of spirits the court held the policy valid  But as Iread the quoted extracts from the opinion thecourts reasoning was not at all based on a definitionof the word never but on a wellestablished precedentholding that to void the policy the misrepresentationmust be such that had the company known thetruth it would not have issued the policy  No insurancecompany would have rejected the risk on thisground said the court  An effete northerner mightchallenge the courts finding that the insureds frequentuse of alcohol was not material to the risk butthis was in Kentucky where bourbon was inventedand is regarded as considerably less harmful thaniced tea            The witnesss oath as required by statute and aseverybody knows is the singsong to tell the truththe whole truth and nothing but the truth  Redundantand imprecise says the author the whole truthis a metaphysical distinction and he cites themuchderided Words and Phrases   Well perhapsBut consider thisDid you write the letterNo  His secretary typed the letter and signedhis name to itDid the policeman stop the carNo  The policeman held up his hand andblew his whistle and the driver then stopped thecar                        Unless a skillful crossexaminer brings out allthe facts a lying witness may avoid a perjury conviction            If legal language were to be stripped of ordinaryEnglish repetition tradition precedent and requirementthere would still remain Professor Mellinkoffbegrudgingly concedes a nubbin of precisionfrom its terms of art   These technical termswith specific meanings are a mere sprinkling asseldom found as nuggets in a salted gold field  Aneat metaphor but I would have added also asprecious  In addition to the authors examples oflease landlord tenant  and surrender  I would submitescrow holograph joint tenancy tenancy in commonprecatory subrogation none of which is mentionedin the book and the invaluable per stirpes all terms of art far more precise than any readyequivalent in backyard English  Phrases like mutuallyagreed and were intermarried are plainly pompousrather than precise as are removed for moveddetermine for terminate and many more            As precision is the loudest virtue of the law sowordiness is its noisiest vice            Brevity is a saving grace but only if it coincideswith precision and intelligibility  Voir dire is shortand precise and intelligible in my opinion this distinctioncan be claimed by many other terms of artincluding tort fee simple easement mens rea  andprima facie case  Andor is short but confusing andproximate cause according to the author is shortbut unintelligible            How truly does the author say that every mechanicalaid the law has seized upon to make itselfmore available has increased its bulk  And thismushroom cloud has expanded at least a hundredfoldsince the book was written  The Frankensteincomputer with its handmaiden word processor havespread before the lawyer a feast of gustatory delightsbeyond the dreams of his voracity  Lusciousparagraphs of whereases corporate powers trusteesduties  and events of default can be mined from thesemonster quarries to be fitted with no other purposethan to encumber lean documents that already performtheir function  These machines are

singularof course including the plural and the masculine thefeminine or even the neuter should a party be ofundetermined sex            Professor Mellinkoff traces the verbosity of lawyersto the historical influences of primitive ritualbilingual duplication and payment by the word certainlytheir Latin and French gave them a runningstart over competing professions  But some wouldsay that spurred by their own vanity and their clientsimpressionability they would have reachedthe pinnacles of pomposity without having to resortto these ancient rites  As wholesale dealers inwords the author maintains lawyers are masters ofplanned confusion  Witness the lawyers addictionto it would seem it may well be  and the likeBut I should have thought that lawyers could havelearned these and other onelegged subjunctivesfrom congressmen cabinet ministers and televisiontalkshow guests who demonstrate extraordinaryproficiency in such equivocations            In the beginning the law was the word itself notthe abstraction that gave it birth  Therefore wordsmust be durable it was believed lest a change in aword change the meaning of the law  A subtle conceptconvincingly explained by the author  To bedurable without writing the law had to be rememberableand the lawyers penchant for repetitioncomes from an outmoded attachment to mnemonicdevices  Assurance of rememberability in writtenlaw rests in the artful remarks usually witty andnearly always metaphoric of such rare jurists asLord Bowen and Justice Holmes the state of amans mind is as much of a fact as the state of hisdigestion A word is not a crystal transparent andunchanged it is the skin of a living thought            In the office as in the courtroom legal languageis intended to impress laymen  Sometimes expectationsmust be met  Sir Leicester the authorquotes from Bleak House  appears to have a statelyliking for the legal repetitions and prolixities asranging among the national bulwarks  If the contractprepared for the client lacks the usual flourisheshe may feel that he is paying for something hecould have written himself  On the other handmany clients appreciate plain wording            Also legal language endures to unite thepriesthood that the discipline may not be madecommon among the vulgar            Three more reasons might have been added insupport of a language of the law distinct from commonspeech  First To Impress the Client discussedunder Durability  should not be limited tothat category            Second is To Persuade the Judge or Jury  Thegood lawyer always mindful of Holmess definitionof the law as the prophecies of what the court willdo in fact and nothing more pretentious will askhimself when drafting any instrument How willthis hold up in court  Indeed this reason overridesall others  The judge is but another lawyer seldomone of the more erudite and he might be more amenableto the old familiar tunes than to start minimalismhowever pure or precise  In jury trials in moststates the complaints and answers stating the partiesclaims and denials are read to the jury as part of theinstructions can be quoted by the lawyers in argumentand may be sent to the jury room  The lawyerserves his client by employing his most impressivelanguage the collision was one of great force andviolence the injuries severe the pain excruciatingand the mental anguish extreme  He is beingpaid for persuasion not simplification            The third addition would be Style pure styleSurely lawyers no less than other artisans are entitledto their little conceits a grace note here a furbelowthere  When I was young at the bar I heardwith delight an old lawyer who could have playedDickenss Mr Tulkinghorn speak grandly of thecourt of nisi prius pronouncing it NICEY PRYUS anutterly obsolete Latinism for the simple trial court Just as any speaker may for the sake of euphony orvanity flourish an occasional eminence grise or mirabiledictu  may not a lawyer plume himself now andthen with an ab initio or even a mutatis mutandis not to unite the priesthood but to savor his ownsonority as a bird sings also for itself            The book as a whole is most praiseworthy  Thefirst half unique and unfaultable will fill a huge gapin the knowledge of all lawyers who are not far morescholarly than any I have ever known  The writing inboth halves though lean and muscularthe authorfalls prey to none of the ills of turgidity that he solavishly dispraisesis polished and witty spicedwith revealing anecdotes and sparkling detail  Inthose few cases with which I have ventured to disagreeI have felt that the authors argument was unworthyof his art            As for the impact on the profession one mustwith a sigh agree with Professor Mellinkoff thatgratuitous literary advice  is received with profoundindifference and that the hardest words oflay critics from Swift to date  have been ignoredwith aplomb  In this era of lawyers unprecedentedwealth and power few of them will expend many oftheir precious minutes listening to admonitions ontheir language  Still there are always the  passionatefew a stray lawyer here and there according tothe author who will fight on in the courtrooms andin the ivory towers at the bar and in the barroomsin the law journals and reviews for the good wordand they will never surrender            In his Preface the author disarmingly tells us thatthe footnotes are for reference only and thatanything worth saying has been said in the body ofthe text  But so provocative is the text itself that Ifound myself irresistibly drawn to those generallyannoying tagalongs in search of the sources  I shallindulge in only this one footnote  In this writinglegal means pertaining to the law rather than lawfullayman means nonlawyer including the

EnglishGeneral dictionaries show pronunciations it is truebut not in the depth displayed in this work  LPD rarely with its precision and almost never with bothAmerican and British pronunciations side by side            The immediate questions that arise are WhichAmerican  Which British  The dialect selected forAmerican English is General American that spokenby the largest number of speakers those who do notdistinguish among Mary marry  and merry  that selectedfor British English as one might expect RPReceived Pronunciation widely regarded as amodel for correct pronunciation  what is used byBBC news readers hence the alternative name BBCpronunciation   As far as the first is concerned itdoes not bear the same relationship to AmericanEnglish that RP bears to British English the pronunciationpattern of the educated speaker in the northeasternUS probably retains much of its former statusand prestige  Having listened to BBC newsreaders for many years I am inclined to regard BBCpronunciation as an archaic or obsolescent term unlessone restricts the designation to news readers onBBC World Service  Certainly the majority of BritishEnglish speakers do not pronounce English in theRP pattern and there is increasing evidence that ifthey aspire to do so they are meeting with littlesuccess  But this is not a book of descriptive phoneticsit is for the learner who aspires to speak thebest English he can and the selection of these twodialects would be hard to fault            The pronunciation system used by Wells isbroad IPA with a few modifications  It is largelyphonemic but there are enough refinements tomake it unique  Wells calls it LPD  I found onlyone transcription to quarrel with by showing  asthe symbol for the General American sound in bothlotodd and startfather  Wells leads one to concludethat General American like RP drops r sounds insyllablefinal position  But that is not the case inGeneral American as the entry for start start bearsout  There is some confusion in the key where thespelled characters represented by the phonetic transcriptionare underscored and the form for GeneralAmerican start should have been start not startMoreover most American dictionaries make a deliberatedistinction between the sounds in oddlot andstartfather  with the former often displaying somerounding or at worst closer to  than to   Thetreatment of nurse and stir  which show  for RP and for General American is closer to the mark            When I worked on the setting up of the pronunciationsystem for the Random House dictionaries Iexamined sound spectrograms of words that middletotal sudden servant father standard  etc thatsome phoneticians transcribed using syllabic   and  What I found was that the syllabics occurred onlywhen the preceding sound was a dental or alveolard or t when it was a velar k or g there wasenough time for a speaker to release a sound whichwas more like a full schwa than a syllabic  Indeedthough it is a matter of degree I find it difficult topronounce a word like organism with a syllabic Z atend rather than a zm  This is the way organismis transcribed in the key but the text itself shows afull schwa which indicates that perhaps Wells vacillatedon this point himself                           LPD lists more than  words includingproper names  The boldface headwords alas in sansseriftype making it difficult to read words like Pillingpillion pilliwinkle Illinois  etc because thelowercase i resembles lowercase l  which is hard todistinguish from capital I  are followed bypronunciations printed in

scope ifnot in style reflecting the varied articles that appearin Names  the journal of the American Name SocietyThose articles are normally written in languagemeant to demonstrate to the world that the writer isan academic this book reflects more the style of aclassroom teacher a mixture of objective and subjectivecomment  For those who know their namebooks it falls somewhere between Basil CottlesNames  and my own Guinness Book of Namesth edition             I mention the latter merely to make it clear thatI am the author of a rival book which covers verysimilar ground and that any comments I make mustbe judged against that background  Like ProfessorAshley I have also been immersed in name studiesfor at least twenty years  His book has not been writtenfor people like me and its real impact will haveto be judged when it gets into the hands of thoseintended readers who are not already onomasticfreaks  Presumably much of the books contents willbe as fresh to such readers as it is familiar to anyonewho already knows his names  That is not meant tobe a sneer  Anyone writing a book of this kind isobliged to go over certain common territory  It ishow you go over it that mattershow entertaininglyhow clearly how elegantly how accurately            In the present case I have some worries aboutthree of those criteria  Having come across reviewerswho quite clearly did no more than glance at thebook concernedone of them once wondered inthe pages of VERBATIM why I had called two chaptersof a book Whats In A Name  though the secondchapter was actually What Is A NameI decidedto give this book a careful reading  Perhaps itis not meant to be read in that way  Consider ProfessorAshleys opening paragraph traditionally theone which an author reads and corrects most oftenHe begins From the beginning people had to havenames to identify themselves  At first one wasenough  There are cultures in which one is stillenough but generally with increases in populationand refinements in civilization there arose a needfor additional designations to identify the membersof a society  To a given name like John or Mary wasappended a second name usually an inheritedfamily name  With the advent of this last namewhich came to be known as a surname from theFrench surnom  given names came to be called firstnames or because we can have more than oneforenames             The casual reader might let that pass I find itdifficult to do so  Surely that opening sentence as itstands is ambiguous  Had to have a name ratherthan names would have been better and in orderto identify and refer to one another would haveavoided the ambiguity of themselves  People usuallyknow who they themselves are  The need for anadditional personal name in Europe rather thangenerally and not before the tenth century arosemore because of the spread of a particular kind ofnaming philosophy than an increase in population ora refinement in civilization  The AngloSaxons didnot allow the duplication of personal names within agroup  There may have been superstitious reasonsfor this connected with namemagic beliefswhereby the use of a living persons name woulddeprive him of his soul but the practical result wasthat everyone was conveniently identified by a singlename            When the Normans conquered England they introducedtheir own philosophy of allowing the samename to be borne simultaneously by many membersof a group  This was not necessarily a more refinedphilosophy merely a different one  The namemagicbelief in this case was that a child named after anadmired figure might cause some of that personsqualities to be passed on to the child  That belief isof course still common today though for that matterso is the other theory  In many Jewish families itprevents the use of a relations name if the personconcerned is still alive            For at least three hundred years the additionaldesignations that the Norman philosophy madenecessary were not inherited family names butbynames which applied only to those who borethem  Thus a John Smith in the Middle Ages reallywas a smith by trade  His son might be a Johnson  hisgrandson a Large because he happened to be a generousfellow  When surnames did become hereditarythey were always not usually the secondnames that went with the given names            Professor Ashley implies that last name wasthe early term which came to be known as a surnameSurname was the original word last name isdecidedly modern  Surname was indeed an adaptationof French surnom  but the Normans called itthat because in Latin it was a super nomen  an extraname  Without this explanation the informationthat surname is from French surnom seems to me tobe of very little interest            The term forenames is to be preferred to givennames or first names  says Professor Ashley  But itisnt  Given name is clearly preferable if one wishesto distinguish between a name bestowed by the parentsin any culture and one automatically inheritedForename fails to help with the problem of thosecountries where the given name is always placedlast  First name is useful when discussing westerncultures since it is usually the callname as somelanguages would describe it  As for the statementthat we should use forenames because we can havemore than one what on earth is wrong with givennames or first name and middle names            I know that Professor Ashleys intended readerwill not nitpick in this way but I can only react tohis book and to each page as I find it  To me itmatters that in his second paragraph for examplehe says that to John Mary Peter Matthew andChristopher the Puritans added for girls PrudenceConstance and Charity and for boys Increase Preservedand Learned  That misses the point entirelyThe Puritans substituted such names for the othersbecause they did not believe in honoring as theywould have put it Popish saints  In a very generalsense the Puritans can be said to have added a fewnames to the stock which modern parents drawupon but the author obviously did not mean thatHe was not trying to tell us that names like IncreaseConstance  and Learned are now in general usethanks to the Puritans            In paragraph three we are told that the Darefamily named the first white baby born in VirginiaVirginia not a conventional name in the late sixteenthcentury but hardly daring considering thereligious association  Indeed along with a slew of nativeBritish names that the English colonists transportedto America the traditional biblical nameswould dominate US birth registers well into thetwentieth century  As Professor Ashley knows thestate was named in honor of Elizabeth I the VirginQueen and not for the Virgin Mary  As for the daringaspect had the child been named Virginia in aPuritan community it would certainly have beenvery provocative  The Puritans would definitelyhave seen the name as having religious associationsor Roman Catholic associations at least and wouldhave objected to it strongly  Finally the nameswhich dominated US birth registers until fairly recenttimes were specifically Old Testament ratherthan merely biblical names  It is that which characterizesAbraham Lincoln Noah Webster and thelike            One does not necessarily expect literary elegancein a book written by an academic but there isno need to be clumsy  Professor Ashley

Thebook was rendered pretty useless pretty soon byname changes  Thats pretty awful Im afraid            There is no index to Whats in a Name  which isas extraordinary as it is infuriating  The

and as the word is not to befound in my  Webster I assume that it is ofrather recent origin  On the evidence of the examplesquoted I also wonder whether it is necessary toconstruct an artificial sublanguage out of the garbledforms that inevitably arise when a language isused by lazy slipshod and semiliterate speakersThese forms are not restricted to America theycome into being wherever English is usedorrather abusedas some of the following commentswill show            Not far from where I grew up in the EnglishMidlands there were villages in which air soundswere regularly replaced by err  A local preacherwho came to our chapel greatly amused us by describingthe encounter of a prophet with a burr aword that kept recurring in his sermon  This wassimply a bear  but the pronunciation was different inthe Bloxwich area as it is in other English dialectsIf a Bloxwich boy wanted to ask Where did hego  he would say Whirdeego  just like theWhirred ego quoted with a little wordwindowdressingby Virginia Howard  Yet you could hardlycall a Bloxwich boy a Slurvian            Some of the other examples Virginia Howardcites are simply misunderstandings of the soundsheard something that inevitably occurs especiallyamong children and semiliterates wherever wordsare spoken  Taking it for granite is a case in pointThis is the same mechanism as is operative in thefamous case of the child who heard the hymnGladly the cross Id bear and thought the adultswere singing about Gladly the crosseyed bearWhen as a little boy I listened to my parents talkingabout breeds of hens

Georgia at some time            Garblings and imbroglios are going on all thetime in English not only in America or in Slurvianbut wherever the lingo is spoken  This reminds meof the worst pun I ever heard  I was sitting with afriend in a restaurant when he noticed anotherfriend at the far end of the room  He wanted to conveya message to him and as there was too muchbackground noise to do so by

shook his head andreplied He wouldnt Hindustanit if I did                              I am beginning to find it irksome to have topoint out every few years that Thomas Crapper didindeed live and that

shmfancyshmancyvalueshmalue and nik spyniknoshnik have become common coin in colloquialEnglish especially in the United States  No book oncurrent English is complete without some account ofYiddishisms  The popularity of the subject seems tohave generated a cottage industry in publishing Iwould venture a guess that apart from dictionariesand grammers more books about Yiddish have beenpublished in the United States in the past twentyfiveyears than about any other minority languageused in this country            A recent products of the Yiddish mill in GeneBluesteins AnglishYinglish Yiddish in AmericanLife and Literature  a title that misleadingly suggestsa scholarly work  This impression is reinforced notonly by the publishers being a university press butby the declaration in the Introduction that Thisstudy is concerned with the function of Yiddish inAmerican life and literature  No such study howeverappears in the book  Instead following theIntroduction and constituting the books main text isa glossary of some  terms entitled AnglishYinglishDictionary  This clearly should havebeen the books title  On the other hand perhapsthe author deliberately refrained from using this titlesince he is not a professional lexicographer andhis dictionary has every mark of an amateurishpiece of work            People without lexicographic training who undertaketo compile a dictionary run the risk of committinginnumerable blunders of the kind that onlythe seasoned professional knows how to avoid  Intackling the field of Yiddish  the compiler runs theadditional risk of plunging into a discipline that requiresextensive knowledge of Yiddish Hebrew andEnglish linguistics etymology and lexicology  Accordingto the description on the books cover GeneBluestein is a musician folklorist and literary criticwho teaches English at California State University atFresno  A lexicographer and Yiddish scholar he isnot  That he is indeed a literary critic and folkloristis demonstrated not only in the generally intelligentand informative Introduction but in two short appendicesone of which subtitled The Jew as Americananalyzes rather well Philip Roths novelPortnoys Complaint  while the other titled TheRevival of KLEZmer Music discusses lucidly a contemporaryaspect of Yiddish folk music  It is regrettablethat these fine pieces are marred by the intrusionof an inferior AnglishYinglish Dictionary            In the brief Preface Bluestein defines Anglish asAnglicized Yiddish which turns Yiddish wordsinto colloquial English as in shmo  and Yinglish asYiddishized English  which gives Englishwords and expressions the qualities of Yiddish syntaxand intonation as in a Heifetz he isnt  Even ifone were to accept this peculiar nomenclature thedistinction it is supposed to draw is hardly significantsince these types of formations are only two ofthe many characteristics of Jewish English the collectiveterms for all the varieties of English used byJews  The very terms Anglish and Yinglish invitescholarly derision as being both facetious and inaccurateTo worsen things the author is not even consistentwithin the framework of this distinction  Mostof the entries in the dictionary are not labeledeither Yinglish or Anglish and for good reason asthey do not fit into either category  For exampleadeSHEM  defined as a Hebrew euphemism for theTetragrammaton kakuhMAYmee  about which theauthor says not Yiddish but it sounds like it misspellingthe actual English word as cockamaimy             The entries are a mishmash run riot  They includeformal Jewishinterest terms Ladino YHVH

illustrated by citations from theworks of writers like Saul Bellow Joseph Heller AllenGinsberg Bernard Malamud Chaim PotokPhilip Roth and Isaac Bashevis Singer  It is a pitythat the author and his

quoted Lewis Carrollstired old Humpty Dumpty quotation aboutwords meaning what he wants them to mean  Such apolicy is unfair of course one should not be prejudicedagainst a persons magnum opus just becausehe has a tiresome taste in quotations  People are foreverdiscovering such quotations for the first timeand should not be excoriated for it by a dyspepticcurmudgeonly reviewer  Reviewers are supposed tohaveor pretend to haveopen inquiring mindsand a boring quotation maketh not a boring booknecessarily  Alas I should learn to follow my instincts            I suppose that there is a category of referencebook called the reverse dictionary   There is no denyingthat such a work which would enable a user tofind the word or phrase he is seeking by looking up ameaning would be quite useful  I have a number ofideas for preparing one in machinereadable formfor use in a computer but I shall not reveal themhere  The way printed versions of such books functionis for the user to look up associated informationThe main problem with them is that they rely on thecompilers ability to anticipate with some accuracythe associative contextual framework of the userWithin the relatively limited amount of informationa bound volume of  pages can provide it wouldbe difficult to anticipate the users mind set with sufficientallowance for elaboration  The books of thiskind that I have tried to use have frustrated me Inever can find what I am looking for            But I am sufficiently openminded to forgetwhat I might be looking forsome bit of lexicographicesoterica no doubtand settle for somethingI consider to be much simpler and not readilyderivable from an ordinary dictionary  As we allknow if we knew the word we were looking for andknew how to spell it we should not have to resort toreverse dictionaries  Trying to be fair I cooked up atest or two  The first to which most of us know theanswer I suppose but that makes it no less legitimateis What is the nautical term for the left andright sides of a boat  One cannot discover the answerby looking up left or right in an ordinary dictionaryof course  Unfortunately neither left norright nor port nor starboard  is in and I should haveto hang around yacht clubs to get the answer  I hadspotted some obscure terms like widdershins undercounterclockwise  when skimming through thebook so I thought Dr Welsh might have concentratedon those  He did to some extent though deasilwas not in so I sought in vain under shadow forantiscian  which is about as obscure as one can getThe other day I had a letter from someone whowanted to know the name for the accent over the rin Dvoak  which happens to be among the two orthree things I know  As Welshs book has a list underPRONUNCIATION I looked there to no avail  It iscalled a haek or hachek or haek  pronouncedHOTchek            I cannot find it in my heart to fault Dr Welsh forhis failure he probably tried out his ideas on friendswho might well have been able to find what theywere looking for  I am convinced that there is a wayto do this kind of thing but a book is not it the kindof associative information required to find even thesimplest thing is likely to vary considerably fromuser to user depending on orientation educationage and other factors including a large variety ofways to access the same information would be veryuneconomical in book form especially when highspeedcomputers with large memories are so readilyavailable  The problem is less one of simple  lexicologyas one of information theory and psychologyI might add artificial intelligence just to make itharder but why make the issue more confused thanit is already  This book does not work for me            Laurence Urdang                              Punching the Clock

idea who wrote this version which Ipicked up from other students as an undergraduateat Rice University                              Stephen Hirschbergs essay brought back tomind a number of mnemonics from my college daysas a chemistry major  Chemists like physicians arefaced with learning long lists of things in our casetrivial that is not systematic nomenclature for varioushomologous series of chemical compounds  Inmost cases there is little in the structures of thesecompounds to hang a name on since many of thenames derive from the natural sources from whichthe compounds were isolated

andstalactites  Mites grow up                              Two items caught my eye in a recent numberXVI  The first is Jonathan Bricklins attribution toone Georges Louis of the observation that Styleis the man himself p   Now it may just be thatsomeone by that namea Frenchman one wouldgather from the spelling Georgesuttered thosewords or foreign equivalents thereof  But I think itmore than likely that Mr Bricklin is referring to thefamous French naturalist GeorgesLouis Leclerecount de Buffon better known to literary historysimply as Buffon  The oftquoted citation is fromthe Discours sur le style  his acceptance speech deliveredbefore the Acadmie Francaise on August   As here it is usually wrenched a little outof context  Buffon did not mean that man paints anautobiographical portrait by his style  Rather that ofall the things an author might describe all are extraneousto him except for his style which is his aloneand hence his only possible passport to literary immortalityLa

the curiosity of thefacts the very novelty of the discoveries are nocertain guarantors of immortality  Thesethings are outside of man while style is manhimself                        The second item on a lighter note is one ofMichel P Richards homophonic epigrams I regretthat I have but one asterisk for my country pIt reminded me of a little jingle that I read years agoin some college alleged humor magazine andwhich I rescue here from a wellearned oblivionMary had a little planeIn which she used to friskNow wasnt she a silly girlHer little                                           Needless to Say            It goes without saying that the duty of the writer isto explain  In the modern world theres no denyingthat everything can in fact be explained  Thebest prose therefore is prose that imposes orderThus are readers made secure and more importantthus is life made simple  Nothing it is clear could bemore selfevident            Yet some writers strive instead for eloquenceThat is they try to produce memorable work  Butthey do so unfortunately at the risk of confusingtheir readers  To start with their writing is oftenrhetorical or even evocative  It contains statementsconsequently that allow varying interpretations inevitablyanything that affects a readers feelings isbound to produce an unpredictable response  Furthermoresuch writers at times resort to humour  Accordinglythey display cynicism or alas lead thereader into ambiguity and paradox  Worst of allthese writers sometimes will communicate surpriseor wonder  The result is to arouse a sense of mysteryIn sum the effect of such writing is to portrayhuman existence as something vague and complexMore than that it can actually complicate mattersfurther  On top of all this we have the unhappy factthat eloquent writing is indeed sometimes memorablecompounding the problem            In contrast the effective communicator createscertainty  He or she does this it is evident in twoways  First he rules out irrelevant or erroneousthoughts in the reader  Second he continually suppliesanswers  In short he maintains command investinghis exposition with all the authority that hecan muster            The goal then is omniscience  Admittedlymost writers are in reality not omniscient  Not yetat any rate  But nevertheless it is within the provinceof any writer to make a definitive statement ona specific point  This surely is sufficient  After allomniscience can be cumulative  Over time manifestlya multiplicity of small omnisciences will addup to total omniscience  It is as if in recognition ofthis perforce that increasing numbers of writers arelooking for a way to produce airtight irrefutableprose  And it is no accident that the English languageprovides just such a method  I refer ofcourse to syllothetics            The syllothetic system had its origins no doubtin the rule followed by the authors of universitymonographs and government position papers  Towit first tell them what you are going to say thentell them what you are saying and finally tell themwhat you have said  A sound practice unquestionablyBut it was observed that readers could be effectivelydirected sentence by sentence  That is to saythe meaning of a sentence could be signaledandthereby validatedby the use of a sentence adverbsuch as moreover indeed  or however   Essentiallythe thrust of the sentence was communicated in advanceIn this way readers knew what a writer wasgoing to say before he said it  In a sense the readerssaid it themselves            To be sure the technique of qualifying sentenceswith modifiers is nothing new  For instancemany writers had sorted out their expository workswith such expressions as incidentally on one hand and for example   In addition others had followedthe practice of enumerating their sentences withfirst second  and third  or next then  and finally  orall of these  More noteworthy some had reinforcedtheir statements with on the one hand such keywords as significantly symbolically  and thankfully or on the other hand such indispensables as unfortunatelyunhappily  and alas   Most significantly itshould be noted many had gone so far as to advancestatements in the form of a premise or a given egit need hardly be stated obviously  and of course ofcourse             Be that as it may the foundations of modernsyllothetics were cemented as we now know withthe systematic use of but at the beginnings of sentencesThere can be no doubt whatever that withthis development logical exposition could therebybecome relentless  It was discoveredand thisshould no longer be any cause for wonderthat asentence containing however could also begin withbut   Moreover but could appear directly in front ofnevertheless   But this development reached its zenithwith the use of but as a topper conjunction seethe beginning of this sentence the topper but doesnot in reality indicate a contradiction for it alwaysappears at the start of a sentence which is truth bein harmony with preceding sentences but rather ittops the previous statements by pointing unerringlyto that which is promised by contradiction namelyillumination  Lets be frank  It was the logical forceof but  in the end that began to supply the dynamismof syllothetics enabling it to combine as itdoes the undeniable energy of the syllogism withthe indisputable power of the theorem            In consequence we have in syllothetics a veritablearsenal of instruments that serve to producecoherence and logic in modern prose  For examplethere is not only affirmation by demonstration ergohence therefore accordingly  but there is also documentationby postulation it can be assumed we cansuppose and also validation by synthesization basicallyin truth in a very real sense as well as verificationby substitution that is to say in other words inshort   Similarly there is not only confutation by disputationon the contrary notwithstanding howevernevertheless  but there is also negation by concessiondespite although allowing that and also notleast refutation by capitulation it might be arguedit would be easy to conclude             Syllothetics it can be seen is inexorable  Eitherwe have corroboration by escalation moreover ontop of that above all  or we have devaluation bydeclination worse worse still worst of all   On onehand we have substantiation by association similarlyin the same way  on the other hand we haveinvalidation by differentiation quite a different matterwe cannot compare something else again             It is hardly necessary to add that syllotheticspossesses the capacity to transcend logic  Who candeny it  We have happily induction by intuitionthe inference that goes beyond mere fact one cannotavoid the suspicion it is difficult to shake off the conviction and also thanks be attestation by clarificationthe proof that is superior to mere evidenceeven so still in any event   Plainly we are in thepresence here of higher truths look at ratificationby approximation for the most part as it werebroadly speaking  witness the revelation of amplificationconceivably it may even be it would not betoo much to say             This brings us willynilly to the infinite utilityof syllothetics  It is a system broadly speaking thatis impervious to criticism  Certainly it is no passingfad dependent on vogue words for despite its infancyit employs such ageold terms as alas albeitperforce  and withal   Nor it can be taxed with pedantrydemonstrably for on occasion it makes use ofcolloquial expressions like for starters likewise forsure  and no doubt about it   Above all though somepeople might think otherwise it definitely does notinvolve clichs  On the contrary  For one thing aclich can be defined as an imaginative expressionwhich through repetition has lost its imaginativenessBut syllothetics in contradistinction shuns theimaginations altogether  More to the point syllotheticsdeploys a vocabulary of unparalleled variety  Infact there are well over one hundred syllotheticmodifiers  And what is more additional ones arecoming into use every day  Hence the recent discoveryby some writers that it is possible to syllothesizeevery sentence            It is true that there are rational writers seeminglylogical who make little or no use of syllotheticsThey feel it would seem that coherence can beobtained without it  They would say undoubtedlythat one sentence follows another  But the questionis how closely  In syllothetics it must be pointedout an expression such as naturally or in otherwords not only introduces a sentence but also refersto the previous one  The effect is that at every stepsyllotheticians have their feet in two sentences as itwere  And by looking backward at all times it needhardly be added they appear to be going nowhereof interest  Naturally nothing is more reassuring toa reader  Nothing in other words is more conduciveto acquiesence            It can be argued you will object that such aprogression is slow and that concommitantly verylittle is being said  But this objection howevermisses the point  True syllotheticians aim high in aword they seek not merely to persuade but to convinceStill the fact that their goals are essentiallymodest  Let it be remembered that they make nodeclarations  They restrict themselves to deductionsbasing them on references citations or precedentswhich is a different matter altogether  Theymay perhaps list variables or on occasion identifyoptions at most they will establish parameters  Butit must be emphasized they do not express anythingThey articulate which is something elseagain  Nor what is more do they ever describeThey delineate which is something entirely differentSo it should come as no surprise to be told thatbasically syllotheticians are at bottom unconcernedabout how little they might have to say            It would not be too much to say that it does notat all matter what may or may not be contained insyllothetic sentences  The content lies rather in thearticulation of the logical relationships betweenthem  But make no mistake about it that is enoughFor clearly although it is the writers duty to explainthe very fact that everything must be explainedmeans indisputably that in due course everythingwill in fact be explained  Ergo the less saidthe better            Already it is becoming very difficult to denyall available evidence points to itthat the day issurely coming withal when there will remain trulyno mere coincidences about which one cannot avoida suspicion or shake off a conviction when clearlyeverything will incontrovertibly support a thesis orconversely stand in direct contrast to it and overridingall this there will as a result be not the slightestdoubt in our minds about one inescapable conclusionnamely the dawning realization that therebeing nothing more to say on the subject as it werewe therefore will no longer hesitate but rather willnecessarily feel compelled to state the obvious  Indeedwe would be remiss in our duty if we failed tomention it  Needless to say                              A Dictionary of Love            This is not a proper

very likely true that he is the most prolificwriter on language in general  His articles OnLanguage have appeared weekly except when hewas taking a holiday in The New York Times Magazinesince   As American language buffsknoweven those who do not take The New YorkTimes he is a fearless commentator on every aspectof English who has gathered behind him notonly an army of admires but a cadre of contributorsdubbed the Lexicographic Irregulars who sendhim citations comments and queries  I call himBill partly because most people do and partly becausewe have known each other since about when his New Language of Politics was edited undermy direction at Random House  Although he is not aprofessional linguist Bill knows a great deal aboutlanguage and notwithstanding some of the commentshe makes in his column is very sensitive to itHe is a very good writer too though I sometimesfind his arch approach unnecessary and a bit annoyinghe seems in a perpetual pursuit of the pun anaffliction not entirely unknown in these hallowedhalls  However I have the same criticism of PhilipHowards commentaries on language publishedfrom time to time in The Times and formerly inthese pages and I can only attribute attrition amongVERBATIM subscribers to that and other weaknessesin myself            Because of the enormous variety of the piecescollected here the anthology is virtually impossibleto review  It doesnt of course deal with every aspectof language but it does cover a very broadspectrum  In fact anyone who pretends to have aninterest in language and who has a library of worthwhileworks on the subject must have all of Safireslanguage books in his library  This is the sixth towhich must be added Words of Wisdom and GoodAdvice  which he wrote with his brother LeonardSafir  The indexes are quite good though not as exhaustiveas one might have wished yet one is likelyto find what he is looking for without difficultyMoreover the books are attractively set out whichadds to their readability  Even the title design isclever it is shown on the jacket over his photowhich the wretch clearly got his son to pose forcover and title page asWilliam SafireLanguage Maven Strikes Again                        It is a pity that the articles are not provided withthe dates of their publication though it is not difficultto understand why the publisher might be reluctantto do so  Yet when I read that a subscriptionto VERBATIM costs  while I am grateful forthe plug I realize that the piece must have appearedquite some time ago  A certain amount of updatingmight be in order perhaps by enclosing in squarebrackets subscription rates in effect at the time ofpublication of the book  Occasionally wrong notonly is Bill not reluctant to admit his errors he maybe one of the few who literally profited from theirmistakes by compiling a book containing many ofthem called I Stand Corrected Times Books it actually contains other matter too            To a subject that is treated in the most turgidfashion by linguists and with unusually irresponsiblescholarship by many other commentators Bill Safirebrings just the right literate human touch oftenfunny ever lively and always friendly informativeand entertaining            Laurence Urdang                              The Power and the Word            In his Preface the author offers My purpose inwriting this book is quite simple to draw togetherand make accessible some of the academic and otherreading that I have done in the past few years  Inthis aim he has succeeded quite admirably thoughone might be given to wonder what if anything hereads for amusement  There are many extremely abstrusenotions in linguistics and if any one might finduseful a brief summarization  sic  of many of the linguisticphilosophies of the past  years this is aconvenient minimalist approach  I say minimalistbecause the ideas are watered down then doubledistilledthen compressed then encapsulated  Becauselinguists are atrociously bad writers in mostcases this would be a merciful deliverance from theagony of wading through their texts at first handwere it not for the unfortunate fact that Andersen isa pretty boring writer himself  Also it would havebeen useful and not necessarily munificent to haveprovided such a book with a reasonably replete indexAlas that is also a barebones affair  I was unableto find Wittgenstein in the Index but I wouldnot lay odds on his having been omitted from thetext            The book is uneven here summarizing an importantscholars work in a paragraph or two theredevoting one entire chapter to womens English andanother to black English both rather disproportionatelytrivial in the general scheme of linguistic theoryMissing is coverage of more important areas oflinguistics like computational linguistics mechanicaltranslation lexicography language analysis bycomputer and some others  But that may merely bereflective of my own interests or does not reflectthe authors readings or probably both  Well onecannot have everything and as I sometimes maintainbut rarely believe a book should be reviewedfor what it contains and not condemned for what itomits            If you are a professional linguist you can passthis one by unless you teach and need a crib foryour students  If you are a student of linguistics inany sense of the term you might find it convenientto have this book to save your running to the multivolumeencyclopedia or the original text if you haveit in order to see what B F Skinner and NoamChomsky were on about  Had it been more completeand better done the book might have servedas a survey text for linguistics a work that is sorelyneeded  The linguists who write books seem invariablyto be scholars who are touting their own pointsof view some of which are recondite to say theleast  Surely there must be a teaching linguist outthere somewhere capable of putting together a cogentreadable text that discusses not only the fieldof linguistics but its various theories and their interrelationsUnfortunately there has not been a goodbookwriting linguist who was also a good writer ofexpository prose

important postscriptto the Ogden Nash poem about the one I lama andthe twol llama   When Nash gets to the three llllama and concludes there isnt any he amendshimself in a footnote The authors attention hasbeen called to a type of conflagration known as thethreealarmer   Pooh  I suppose this just supports anold adage footnotes are forgettable                              I have recently met two phrases that I cannotfind in the sort of reference books that might be expectedto define them if they are as the author I wasreading implied recognized political or economicterms  The first sobornostic collectivism  is said torefer to a Leninist school of thought the secondagathistic distributism  is called a theory of economicnationalism                           Sobornost is a word used by some Russian Orthodoxtheologians and there is or was a philosophicposition called agathism   The curious are directedto OED  Collectivism is part of the commonvocabulary now and distributism was a movementthat enjoyed Chesterton and Belloc as its chief advocatesI am however unable to see much meaningin those twoword phrases  Can any reader of VERBATIMoffer information about them                              People often ask me how they can improvetheir vocabularies and what books I can recommendas aids  My invariable reply is that the only genuineway to increase ones vocabulary is by reading readingreading  It may not be an immediately obviousfact but it is significant that the people who ask thequestionstrangers who telephone meare quitearticulate from which I deduce that one must havereached some proficiency in language before becomingaware that there might be some deficiencyI can get by in a couple of other languages chiefly inreading not speaking them but feel that I cannotafford the time to improved my control of other languagesat the expense of my continuing efforts tolearn what I can about English  That is of course apurely personal view and should under no circumstancesbe construed as an adverse comment on thestudy of foreign languages  But there is a differencebetween learning about them and trying to gain fluencyin them I think I know a fair amount aboutmany languages in which I have no speaking or writingability however rewarding fluency in themmight be for aesthetic reasons to read their literaturefor example one has just so much timethose who need them for practical reasons shouldnot be deterred or discouraged by these remarksnor should those who wish to study them for anyother reason  The study and acquisition of foreignlanguages living and dead is both intellectually andpractically rewarding  By the time I graduated fromcollege I had studied Latin and French for elevenyears Greek for four German and Old English fortwo Lithuanian and Sanskrit for one and had establisheda passing acquaintance with Swedish DanishNorwegian Italian Spanish Portuguese and PolishI can get by in French after I have spoken it forseveral hours but I do not speak much Latinpartly perhaps because of the paucity of conversationalcompanions  I bring this up not to vaunt anygreat accomplishments but to emphasize that I amthe first one to encourage the study of foreign languagesI simply draw the line between studyingthem and learning them learning a foreign languageis extremely difficult and most of those who aretruly fluent in a second language have been broughtup in bilingual or sometimes trilingual situations            I raise the matter of foreign languages in connectionwith vocabulary partly because familiaritywith Greek and Latin and French and German isparticularly useful in establishing an intimate relationshipwith the English language  I have oftenbeen told that English is a difficult language to learnbut as a native speaker I have no personal opinionabout that  I do know however one person whoacquired English relatively late in life and whom Iconsider to have a better command of the mediumthan most native speakers  That person is an exceptionindeed she has a younger sister who acquiredEnglish at the same time who has difficulty expressingherself  These examples may serve to confirmwhat we all already suspect that there is a spectrumof natural ability for language with the gifted at oneendpresumably our poets writers lawyers politiciansteachers and so forthand the less gifted atthe other  The former possess Sprachgefhl a sensitivityfor language language sense from among thelatter I exclude pathological cases  In that connectionI am constrained to express my skepticism aboutthe accuracy and wisdom of diagnosing everyonewho has difficulty learning to read and write as beingafflicted with dyslexia learning is sometimes difficultIhad terrible trouble with history when I wasa studentand it is wrong to attribute a large percentageof failures and difficulties to some disorderrather than to the possible failings of a teacher ormore often to a simple lack of interest and motivationin the student            Fortunate are those who have been raised in areading household or have acquired a thirst and opportunityfor reading early in life  Fortunate tooare those who were given the opportunities of beingexposed to teachers who were not too busy or lazyto assign weekly essays and to mark them for style aswell as for grammar and mechanics  For the manipulationof language as an art one must first view it as acraft and the acquisition of any craft cannot be accomplishedwithout effort one does not become awriter by sitting around thinking about it or by sayinghe is a writer when someone asks What do youdo one is a writer by virtue of the fact that hewrites with no regard whatsoever to publication            In this connection it is not the quantity of vocabularythat marks a good writer but the qualityWhen people ask me about increasing their vocabulariesoften suggest that they read The Growth of theSoil  by Knut Hamsun  Hamsun a Norwegian wonthe Nobel prize in  and is seldom talked aboutthese days though as far as I am aware his booksare in print in any event they are available from thelibrary  Hamsun wrote in Norwegian of course I donot know who translated Growth in the edition inwhich I originally read it which I think was ModernLibrary but as a teenager I was terribly impressedby the writing  The story is unimportantsome bucolictalebut the writing is extraordinary and Imust assume that while the art of the original remainsno small credit is due to the translator  Whatmakes this book such an exemplary piece of work isthat I doubt it contains many words of more thanone syllable so to speak  It is consequently a modelof clarity as well as of simplicity and an abiding lessonto all who think that increasing their vocabularieswill make them more articulate            It is interesting to note that one of the most successfulvocabulary books bears the title It Pays toIncrease Your Word Power  that is not somethinglike It Pays to Increase Your Vocabulary  In otherwords memorizing a slew of arcane recondite sesquipedalianismsis not what gives one the edge it isknowing how to use the language one already possessesUse a word five times and it is yours is aslogan that is occasionally seen blazoned across mailorderadvertising  It conjures up the picture ofsomeone boning up on his word for the day justbefore attending a cocktail party and then awkwardlytrying to steer the conversation in such a waythat he can insert a word like paradigm paragon  orparameter             Those who wish to sharpen their language skillsare best advised to read and write and to do both asmuch as possible perhaps trying to emulate an admiredwriter  If it is felt that some guidance isneeded then they should hire a tutorthere oughtto be plenty of good ones available everywhere  Attendingwriting classes is a possible alternative butthose vary so in quality as well as purpose that anindividuals needs might not be met  Finally theyshould not view editors as their tutors submittingtheir writings in the hope of critique however goodthey might be as editors they are not necessarilygood teachers and are usually focused very specificallyon the demands of
