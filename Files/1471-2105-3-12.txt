                    Background                  Computational methods for whole genome          studies          Comparative genomics and more specialized fields such          as comparative virology etc involve the comparison of          DNA sequences genes and genomes       Recent          rapid data acquisition is allowing the analyses of whole          genome sequences especially the smaller genomes such as          mitochondria and chloroplasts       as well as          the larger bacterial genomes     and large tracts          of eukaryotic chromosomes especially from related          organisms           These studies          include the determination of the order of genes           ie colinearity      the          location of synteny      and the identification          of clusters of orthologous genes cog between two          genomes       Along similar lines of thought it          should be extremely useful to locate identify and          catalog the sets of core genes common to these          genomesgenomes which otherwise may be related or          semirelated or unrelated in other respects These global          views allow for a deeper understanding of one organism in          the context of another especially in regards to their          genomic contents In addition the comparison of multiple          genomes and the identification of related genes and          core genes can lead to insight into the structure and          function of genes and genomes     This is very useful          in genome annotations and also in the identification and          characterization of functions for newly found putative          genes          Identification of core genes from small whole          genomes is useful and complements other data derived from          these genomes Small genomes include those from viruses              mitochondria     and chloroplasts              The increasing importance of the large amount of DNA          sequence data recently collected from these small genomes          is reflected in the better understanding of their biology                 and in the upsurge of publications          analyzing these genomes and the organisms to which they          belong                           Genome colinearity gene clustering and homolog          identification are three global genome analyses which are          important in many fields of research including resolving          phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships                                           Results and Discussion                  Description of CoreGenes          CoreGenes is written in JAVAbased programming          incorporating the setdb and BLASTP programs from the          WUBLAST package of Washington University          httpBLASTwustledu The basis of this iterative          comparison rests on the BLASTP algorithm     A          flowchart of the processes is illustrated in Figure           This software allows for the identification          characterization catalog and visualization of putatively          essential core genes in sets of two to five genomes in          a userfriendly GUI environment A table with additional          content information is generated from the analyses          CoreGenes has been validated with representative genomes          from several families of viruses as well as          mitochondrion and chloroplast genomes In these examples          it locates and identifies putatively related genes          directly and gene clustering indirectly In light of the          similarities of certain genes generated by CoreGenes one          may ponder their relationships upon further and closer          inspection given that the high BLAST scores between two          genes do not always imply an orthologous relationship              In other words the complexity of these BLAST          scores suggests that the user should perform rigorous          phylogenetic analysis of each set of homologous genes to          determine true orthology Though if the user uses a high          threshold value while using GeneCore she will increase          the chances to retrieve orthologous genes          One obvious application is to use this tool as a step          in the characterization of an alphabet of putatively          essential core genes in a set of closely related          genomes such as from a collection of poxvirus genomes            unpublished data                           CoreGenes graphical user interface          The CoreGenes GUI contains three levels of data          inputoutput starting with an interface for the entry of          two to five genomes via GenBank accession numbers Figure           and ending with a display of the corresponding protein          of interest as archived in the NCBI database Contained          within the toplevel GUI Figure  is an entry field for          up to five genome sequences           Nota Bene entering GenBank          accession numbers with dyslexic renderings will result in          error messages It is preferable to use the recent          versions of GenBank accession numbers ie prefixed          with NC          Once the program is initiated the respective genome          data are downloaded from the GenBank database Figure           These genome sequence data are subsequently parsed into          proteincoding sequences as annotated in the GenBank          database and are converted by CoreGenes into          GeneOrderFASTA format        Comparisons          are performed and the results are presented in a tabular          format in the subsequent GUI Each gene has a hyperlink          to its entry in the NCBI database                          Data mining algorithm          BLASTP protein similarity analyses    between the          reference sequence and the first query sequence are          performed sequentially with each query protein compared          individually to the entire protein database of the          reference genome This is similar to the algorithm for          the GeneOrder analyses      If the alignment score          between the reference protein and a query protein meets          or exceeds a defined similarity threshold number then          the proteins are paired and their accession numbers          stored A consensus map of related genes is generated and          stored Hierarchical comparisons with additionally          entered query genomes up to four in total are performed          in each session          In detail the process continues as query genome          number  data are retrieved from GenBank and treated as          described above           ie this set of proteins is          compared against the first consensus set of paired genes          formed between the reference genome and query genome          number  A second consensus set of related genes is          generated and stored Query genome numbers  and  are          iteratively and separately analyzed in an analogous          manner A caveat is that if query genome number  does          not have a match to the reference genome then a          subsequent query genome number  match to the original          reference genome            ie possible true related gene          will be discarded In other words hierarchical matches          must occur between the reference genome query genome          number  and query genome number  in order for CoreGenes          to identify BLAST matches between the reference genome          and the query genome number  A visual presentation of          this is shown in Figure top panel where the genomes          are aligned with the reference genome serving as the          xaxis Genes from query genomes that have the desired          BLAST matches are arrayed vertically above the reference          genome This despite its shortcoming of terminating a          further analysis should there be no match between the two          immediate genomes is useful as a simple map of the order          of genes contained in the reference genome It also          serves as a quick simple survey of the set of genomes in          terms of BLAST matches          However permutations of the five genomes must be          analyzed in order to collect the comprehensive set of          putatively related core genes Given the five genomes to          be queried this task is daunting manually Of course it          would be useful to generate a table of genes that bin          across only   or  genomes This is being addressed          actively It is anticipated that this comprehensive table          of genes including rows with matches across only two          three or four genomes will be made available in the near          future Meanwhile upon the completion of the above          algorithm a table containing the extracted GenBank data          and summarizing the core genes within the queried          genomes is generated Figure bottom panel The columns          of this table can also be exported via cut and paste          into Microsoft Excel and Word programs to generate          publication quality figures          Accession numbers of each gene and very brief          descriptions are presented in each individual block          within this matrix as extracted directly from the          GenBank database Each individual gene is hyperlinked          from this table to the NCBI website to allow the          investigator an opportunity to view the unique GenBank          file for the gene of interest                          Using CoreGenes                      Similarity ranges            Contained in the toplevel window is a field to            define the minimum protein similarity score              i e BLASTP threshold score            These can be either the default  or a            userdefined value Score ranges are related to the            similarities of the proteins being queried                 For reference the three similarity ranges that can be            defined for running GeneOrder are highest A            high B and low C      The BLASTP threshold            score ranges for each are as follows A is defined            from  B is defined from  and C is            defined from  Genes with matches in the A            range are true homologs while those in the B range            are likely related and those in the C range require            visual validation of the level of identity in order to            ensure a true match Related gene matching values for            CoreGenes are also defined in this manner Caveat it            is always recommended that the results between two            BLAST matches be scrutinized as reports have suggested            that the closest BLAST match is often not the nearest            neighbor                                    Examples of CoreGenes analyses            This tool has been validated with analyses of            several diverse virus chloroplast and mitochondrion            genomes For example a set of four chloroplast genomes            Figures and  and a set of five mitochondrion            genomes data not shown from evolutionary divergent            sets of organisms were run independently to demonstrate            the power and capabilities of CoreGenes Shown in            Figure is an output from one of these analyses With            the BLASTP threshold score set at  the core            genes are cataloged and displayed with brief            identifying information from the GenBank database            Sixtyone core genes were cataloged from the set of            chloroplast genomes data not shown The genomes are            as follows             Arabidopsis thaliana  NC                        Nicotiana tabacum  NC             Oryza sativa  NC and             Chlorella vulgaris  NC            Mitochondrion genomes are as follows             Homo sapiens NC             Gallus gallus NC             Caenorhabditis            elegans NC             Drosophila            melanogaster NC and             Schizosaccharomyces            pombe NC An analysis was also performed            with a mixture of mitochondrion and chloroplast            genomes Interestingly several putatively related            genes were detected in this particular analysis data            not shown                                Additional validations            In addition to the aforementioned chloroplast and            mitochondrion genomes and of more interest to our            research group CoreGenes has been validated with virus            genomes ranging in size from  kb to  kb data not            shown Specifically it has been run with combinations            and permutations of adenovirus genomes             ca  kb NC NC            NC NC NC NC NC            and NC poxvirus genomes ca  kb NC            NC NC NC NC NC            and NC and other viruses of varying sizes             ca  kb              eg baculoviruses             Heliocoverpa armigera            nucleopolyhedrovirus G  NC and             Lymantria dispar

Molluscum contagiosum virus            NC and fowlpox virus NC and two            entomopox viruses              Melanoplus sanguinipes            entomopoxvirus NC and             Amsacta moorei            entomopoxvirus NC was analyzed with            CoreGenes With related genomes such as these the data            can also be used as a predictive tool for the            elucidation of an alphabet of essential genes            especially in collaboration with wet bench analyses            such as the characterization of temperature sensitive            mutants for example poxviruses data not shown                                    Limitations                      Server Connectivity            CoreGenes run time is a function of the network            connections If one party such as the NCBI server is            experiencing heavy traffic or is down due to technical            difficulties then the application will stall and be            unsuccessful Sets of orthopoxviruses             ca  kb take approximately             minutes to run on a PowerMac G running Mac OS  and            Netscape Communicator  Larger genomes are currently            problematic due to the computational speed the NCBI            server andor the users connection timing out This            issue is being addressed            Some network firewalls may be incompatible with            this software causing the connections to terminate            prematurely An error message An internal error has            occurred Please try again later java langNullPointer            Exception will be displayed Also entering incorrect            accession numbers may give this same message            Alternatively CoreGenes has been run successfully on            university and public library terminals with internet            access These organizations do not seem to have the            firewall needsconcerns as other organizations                                Platform Limitations            CoreGenes has been validated with several different            platforms and also with different web browsers            Macintosh Explorer  and Netscape  PC Explorer             and Netscape  SGI Netscape and SUN            Netscape workstations There are compatibility issues            between CoreGenes and Macintosh Netscape  and            below Using Netscape  surmounts these problems            This problem appears to lie in the JAVA applet included            with the earlier version of Netscape for Macintosh            Moving an Applesupplied JAVA Accelerator for PowerPC            into the extensions folder may allow earlier versions            of Netscape to run this program Printing the CoreGenes            appletgenerated graph may be problematic due to an            applet incompatibility capturing the graph as a            screenshot via the PC and the Mac platforms and            printing independently circumvents this            Run times vary from  minute and  seconds for a            set of five adenovirus genomes              ca  kb to  minutes for a            set of five poxvirus genomes              ca  kb Currently if there            are multiple requests the computation may take much            longer as the requests are queued This inconvenience            is being addressed and is due to the server hosting the            software Depending on the hardware some local servers            may time out during this period while waiting for this            request to be processed which will result in an error            message stating that The attempt to load servlet            failed Adjusting preference settings on the local            web browser may rectify this problem Immediate goals            of improvement include an option to have results            emailed back to the user We expect that there will be            additional improvements in both speed and response            issues when we upgrade our server hardware and rewrite            some of the CoreGenes software to accommodate the            larger megabasesized genomes                                Software Limitations            Only the NCBI database can be searched at this time            in other words only GenBank accession numbers can be            used If there is an operator error in entering the            number correctly then an error message will be            displayed             eg The attempt to load            servlet failed Improvements to this software will            include providing an additional field to enter            proprietary and nonGenBank genome data similar to an            option developed for GeneOrder                                          Conclusions        CoreGenes fits into the niche for GUIbased interactive        computational tools             that enhance        the visualization of DNA sequence data especially in the        context of genome comparisons It meets a critical need for        tool sets containing global whole genome analyses tools        As noted earlier small genomes are still of great interest        to many researchers This tool is a base to expand upon        for example to build more robust elegant and        complementary whole genome computational tools Although        CoreGenes successfully expedites the determination of        core genes during the comparisons of several small whole        genomes simultaneously it will likely be succeeded by        improved software to compare and analyze even much larger        genomes especially in the megabase range This feature is        being pursued with urgency One known current limitation in        analyzing larger genomes is computational         e g hardware this will be        addressed shortly Increasingly powerful workstations to        act as servers will allow the much more computationally        intensive comparisons of megabasesized genomes However        this version of CoreGenes is very useful and fills a        current unmet need in genome analyses that of collecting        related genes in a family of genomes In addition to        stimulating the development of similar tools CoreGenes        will allow continuing improvements to it We plan to        support aggressively this version of CoreGenes updating        with improvements and additional features as well as to        work on a more robust faster version
