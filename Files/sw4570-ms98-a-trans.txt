            uh do you have a couple of children   i have one shes twenty months old   uhhuh oh boy   how many do you have  how many do you have   at least youre sleeping i have uh two boys ones eleven and ones fourteen   oh   i imagine the activities we uh encounter with our kids are quite different at this point   they probably are  but maybe you can give me some insight and i can remind you of the  old times huh   oh i remember them fondly it seems like the the baby like young children uh destroy your sleep and older children destroy your life   yeah   and i dont really mean that it   well ive heard that it only gets worse my husband and i sit around thinking gosh you know what are we going to do when she starts going out and having friends and going to school and getting exposed to all the other things out there   oh i think the biggest problem is that you just have no training for this   yeah   and you really have to wing it you know as you go   yeah yeah   but i i remember fondly having the small ones they they seemed real happy and it was so easy to solve their problems and as they get older it just seems that everything is more serious and and   complicated   its more complicated its emotional its not a matter of giving them a lollipop anymore it it just gets harder     yes   but um what weve done and you might want to do as you know as time flies by is im remarried and my husband never had any kids   uhhuh   so we were trying to figure out how um how we would make this turnover as smooth as possible and we came up with what we call the family meeting   umhum   and once a week we get together and this is a chance when the kids can say whatever they want without us getting insulted about it   yeah   and we have sort of an agenda thats like good news this week bad news this week uh suggestions any new business any uh   hm   any questions questions any anything you know and we   how long does that last how long does your meeting last   well it it changes it could be a quiet week it could be the kind of thing where kids want to go do something else so it goes pretty quick at the end is allowance so they have to make it through you know collect     that sounds like a good theory or a good way to do it   well you know we we actually sit and talk to each other once a week at least you know not that we dont all the time   right   but it it it works out nicely and i dont know you know i think id do that even if i wasnt remarried if i had thought about it   yeah   and you know we plan also plan a family activity because people are coming and going and its hard to be all together to do something so   uhhuh what kind of things do you do on the family activities   well it could be a game of Scrabble and or it could be you know reading a book out loud or making up a story and passing it around the table you know one sentence to each person   umhum   and um its its not something thats impossible i mean the kids will usually want to go to a game park or something you know we cant do that you know we try to keep it real   yeah right its getting quite expensive to do that these days   oh please       yeah that another thing that comes up with us is family vacation   yeah   we just kind of knock our heads we dont know how to make that right it seems as if we do what they want uh we marathoned a trip in California we stayed with some relatives for awhile and then we went to Sea World and we went to Disneyland and we we went to every kid thing   did you drive there   uh no we we flew to California and we stayed free at my aunts house so that gave us a base in San Diego   yeah yeah   and we saw Sea World and the zoo and this and that and our lives were sort of normal because we you know it was someone elses house so we made sure we had dinner at dinnertime and that kind of thing then we drove a bit further and when we were on our own it just kind of fell apart because wed stay late at the parks and i didnt enjoy it after awhile you know once is you know its interesting but its really not my cup of tea and family vacations are kind of difficult     yeah   you know sharing a room with the kids is not much of a vacation once theyre old enough to know the difference   true true   so   yeah my husband wants to go on a family vacation were on the east coast like you and he wants to go out to uh the Grand Canyon and do that sort of thing when Helen gets a little older but its hard to tell i at twenty months old hes he wants take her to the zoo and that sort of thing but im not sure if shes ready for any of that if shes you know if it could hold her interest   hm   so we dont really have anything any kind of family activities to do we basically just sit around the house and she runs from one to the other and we read to her thats something she enjoys   well i guess the playgrounds used to be hot when the kids were little   yeah theres not many of them out there though like was when i was young   huh   i mean there was a playground just about in every neighborhood but i dont even know where one is around here anymore   there might be some at the schools   yeah   you know that you can use when its an off time you know on a weekend or something   yeah thats a good idea   and a lot of if you have a a YMCA or something they have kind of a tot programs where they have little exercise class for kids her age and all kinds of things   uhhuh yeah hm   what help yeah go ahead   probably probably be very hard to be the instructor  twenty months old   huh yeah but thats not your problem thats the fun of it you
