                                 Timor Killers Caught on Tape            TheIndependentof London led its front page Monday with what it claimed was the first cleardocumented evidence that the Indonesian army directed the slaughter in EastTimor It published transcripts of recordings of twoway radioconversations between the special forces unit of the Indonesian armytheKopassusand antiindependence militias Radio conversations between Kopassusofficers and militia commanders shortly before and after the Aug  referendumincluded Kopassus saying It is better we wait for the result of theannouncement of the ballot  Whether we win or lose thats when wellreact Also Kopassus Those white people referendum observers  shouldbe put in the river Militia commander passing the order to othermilitiamen If they want to leave pull them out of their car kill themand put them in the river Kopassus They need to be stopped MilitiamenIt will be done Ill wipe them out all of them Ill eat them up            OnSunday the Observer of London led with an exclusive report thatmembers of the Kopassus had been secretly trained in the United States under aprogram codenamed Iron Balance Quoting Pentagon documents obtained by theUSbased East Timor Action Network and Rep Lane Evans DIll theObserver said the program was hidden from legislators and the publicwhen Congress curbed the official schooling of Indonesias army after amassacre in  The training of Kopassus went ahead nevertheless at Americantaxpayers expense despite US awareness of its role in the genocide of about people in the years after the invasion of East Timor in  thepaper said It quoted a  cable to the State Department from an unidentifiedformer official of the US Embassy in Jakarta that the training had been abig help to the Indonesian army They probably killed a lot of people and Iprobably have a lot of blood on my hands            As thefirst peacekeepers arrived in East Timor the South China Morning Post took a hard line against theIndonesian government in an editorial Monday saying that if the army lets itsmilitia puppets fight the UN forces then Jakarta should pay a heavy priceInternational agencies should halt all aid and other countries should bringmaximum pressure on Indonesia to act like the responsible nation it so oftenclaims to be The liberal Jakarta Post predicted a strengthening of the power of the Indonesianmilitary with the anticipated passage in parliament this week of a new statesecurity bill Condemning Indonesias reform leaders for their lack ofresistance to the bill the paper said it would give the military almostunlimited power in a state of emergency including the right to jail peoplewithout trial The day the House of Representatives endorses the bill will bea sad day for civil society sounding the death knell for the reformmovement            Acommentary in the Jakarta Post warned thatAustralias leadership of the peacekeeping force could destroy the hithertoclose relationship between Australia and Indonesia Aleksius Jemadu a lecturerin international relations at Parahyangan Catholic University in BandungIndonesia wrote that the East Timor militias might target Australian troopsthus drawing Australia into a conflict much more complicated than it everexpected The possibility of an open conflict with Indonesia cannot be ruledout particularly if prointegration militias launch an attack from the westernhalf of the island of Timor Noting that the Indonesian military is verysuspicious about Australias motivation in East Timor believing it may haveas much to do with Prime Minister John Howards popularity at home as withhumanitarian concerns Jemadu asked Does Australia have a strategic agendawhich might strengthen its bargaining position visavis its closest northernneighbor Now Australias fear of Indonesia is turning out to be aselffulfilling prophecy            Thesame kind of anxieties were expressed in the Sydney Morning Herald Michelle Grattan wrote that without a clear exit timetable Australiasrelationship with Indonesia will be seen through the Timor prism for yearsrather than months She said The surge of feeling for our boys on theirdeparture is dangerously fuelling nationalist sentiment in both countriesAustralian business interests in Indonesia are being hit by the surge ofantiAustralian emotion And alarmingly despite the fact that Australia isputting pressure on Indonesia rather than vice versa some Australianpoliticians are starting to talk in old threatfromthenorth language            Whileremarking that Australia had played a commendably sensible diplomatic rolethroughout the latest troubles the Financial Times of London said Monday in an editorial thatthe venture has also exposed latent resentment of the potential leadershipof Australia in the region particularly from Malaysia which has refused totake part in the peacekeeping force under Australian command Le Monde of Paris made thesame point Sunday in an editorial saying that most Asian countries with theexception of Thailand which accepts all its responsibilities regard theintervention in East Timor as an example of western neocolonialism but itargued that the intervention is justified by international justice and in thespecific case of Indonesia by its wish to benefit from the globalization oftrade and from substantial international financial aid In an editorial Monday the Bangkok Post praised Thailands decision to join thepeacekeeping force and described it as a policy of tough love            InSpain El Pasreported an improvement in SpanishChilean relations because ofChiles decision to raise the case of Gen Augusto Pinochet with theInternational Court of Justice in the Hague It quoted Spanish Foreign MinisterAbel Matutes as saying this could bring a complete solution to the rowgenerated by Spains request for Pinochet to be extradited from Britain formurder torture and other human rights violations It said the Spanish andChilean foreign ministers will meet for talks in New York this week            InLondon the Times reported Monday that British mountaineer GeorgeMallory who died on Mount Everest in  may have been the first person toreach the summit after all A book by members of the team that found his bodyon the mountain last May revealed that he had enough oxygen to do so and italso offered another tantalising clue  It is known that Mallory hadintended to place a photograph of his wife Ruth on the summit should he reachit No photographs were found on his body Where are they the authors askif not at the summit  In an editorial the Times which isserializing the book Ghosts of Everest The Search for Mallory  byJochen Hemmleb Larry Johnson and Eric Simonson admitted that the evidence ishardly conclusive but said that an American search expedition will return toEverest next year to look for the body of Mallorys fellow mountaineer AndrewIrvine and for the missing camera with which Irvine planned to record them bothon the roof of the world
