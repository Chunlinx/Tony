                    Introduction        Breast cancer is predicted to be newly diagnosed in        about  women in  in the United States             Twelve percent of all women will be diagnosed with breast        cancer in their lifetime and  will die of the disease        The cell transformation associated with breast cancer        requires the coordinated activation or inhibition of        specific intact or altered genes Transcription factors        frequently regulate these processes An important type of        transcription factor contains a conserved region of         amino acids called the homeodomain HD encoded by a DNA        region the homeobox HB HD proteins are involved in the        control of development and differentiation in many        organisms      Initially discovered in         Drosophila  mutations of the HB in        homeobox genes result in vast morphologic abnormalities            Subsequently homologous HB genes have been cloned in        many species including humans              Vertebrate HB genes are divided into two classes Class        I genes HOX genes are organized into four clusters HOX        A B C D with a total of  members     Members of        Class II are also called divergent genes including genes        such as PAX MSX IRX and DLX named after their homologs        in         Drosophila paired muscle segment        Iroquois and distalless respectively             Accumulating evidence suggests that homeobox genes are        important in malignant transformation Not only have        altered expression levels of HB genes been detected in a        variety of human malignancies         but the        ectopic expression of certain HOX genes can induce tumors              Abnormal HOX gene expression has been        associated with breast cancer For example the murine        Hoxa gene is upregulated in neoplastic murine mammary        glands     In humans the lack of HOXA expression        results in the loss of p expression in breast cancer            Enforced HOXB expression in SkBr breast cancer cells        induces the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor        and increases growth rate serumindependent growth and        the ability of cells to form colonies in semisolid medium            Nude mice when injected with SkBrHOXB cells        developed tumors            We have cloned a human homeobox cDNA called BP        belonging to the DLX family BP is apparently involved in        the regulation of diverse pathways In normal erythroid        cells it acts as a repressor of the globin gene             However BP was also expressed in  of the adult and         of the pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients we        examined and its overexpression increased the leukemogenic        potential of K cells         in vitro     Molecular analysis        revealed that BP expression is required for the survival        of K leukemia cells suggesting that BP might be part        of an antiapoptotic pathway Davenport GJ Fu S Haga SB        Do K Stevenson H Pinzone J Chase MB Berg PE        unpublished data Furthermore these results imply that        aberrant BP expression might also be involved in other        malignancies In the present study we analyzed BP        expression in human breast cancer cell lines and assessed        BP expression in invasive ductal carcinoma tumors        correlating its expression with age tumor size lymph node        metastasis histologic grade estrogen receptor ER        status progesterone receptor PR status and race                    Methods                  Cell lines          The breast cancer cell lines HsT MCF MDAMB          MDAMB and TD were kindly given to us by Dr          Angela Brodie MCFADR and MDAMBS were a gift from          Dr Joseph Fontana and MCFA was purchased from the          American Type Culture Collection ATCC Manassas VA          USA Cell lines were grown in Dulbeccos modified          Eagles medium supplemented with  fetal calf serum          except for MCFA cells which were grown as recommended          by the ATCC                          Human breast tissues          Human breast tumor samples were obtained from The          George Washington University Department of Pathology and          the NCI Cooperative Human Tissue Network Southern          Division all with Institutional Review Board approval          and as previously described     Breast tissue          samples  cm in diameter were obtained from fresh          surgical resection specimens from patients with breast          tumors and were characterized pathologically in terms of          their stage in malignancy The samples were snapfrozen          in liquid nitrogen and were kept frozen until use Normal          breast tissues were obtained from the periphery of          specimens surgically resected for treatment of cancer or          from an autopsy specimen obtained from a patient who had          died of injuries sustained in an accident not breast          cancer the latter was obtained from the Brain and          Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders at the University          of Maryland                          RNA isolation and reverse transcription polymerase          chain reaction RTPCR          Total RNA was extracted from human breast cell lines          frozen breast tumor tissues and normal breast tissues          with Trizol reagent Invitrogen Gaithersburg MD USA          in accordance with the manufacturers protocol Total RNA           g was used to synthesize cDNA with a SuperScript II          reverse transcriptase system Invitrogen After          synthesis of the firststrand cDNA PCR was performed by          initial denaturing at C for  min followed by           cycles of denaturation at C for  min annealing at          C for  min and extension at C for  min The          PCR primers for BP which span an intron were          GTATGGCCACCTCCTGTCTT forward and          GAGTAGATGGTCCTCGGCTT reverse giving a product          of  base pairs The internal control for all samples          was actin                          Statistical analyses          Statistical analyses were used to determine the          relationship between BP positivity measured by RTPCR          and clinicopathological parameters All           P values were calculated with          Fishers Exact Test Tests were considered significant if          their associated           P value was  or less          twotailed All statistical analyses were performed          with SAS  SAS Institute Cary NC USA                            Results                  BP expression in breast cell lines          BP mRNA levels were analyzed in a series of breast          cell lines by using RTPCR The cell lines are derived          from breast cancer patients with the exception of          MCFA which is an immortalized nontransformed          epithelial cell line     As shown in Fig  the          levels of BP expression varied widely between the cell          lines from barely detectable HsT MDAMBS and          MCFA lanes   and  respectively to highly          expressing MCFADR MDAMB and TD lanes            and  respectively MCF and MDAMB lanes  and           respectively showed intermediate expression For          comparison one normal breast tissue from an autopsy was          included in the first lane it was BPnegative          There was a correlation between BP expression and          tumorigenesis in mice Table  The cell lines that          express little or no BP HsT MDAMBS and          MCFA are not tumorigenic whereas MCFADR MDAMB          and MDAMB express BP and are tumorigenic MCF and          TD cells express variable BP levels and are          tumorigenic only in the presence of estradiol               BP expression might therefore be involved in          tumorigenesis in mice Transgenic studies would provide          direct evidence for this hypothesis                          BP expression in breast tumor tissues          BP mRNA expression was examined in  invasive ductal          breast tumors including grades I II and III tumors and          in some cases compared with adjacent normal breast          tissue Of these tumors  expressed BP In contrast          of seven normal breast tumors analyzed six were          BPnegative and one showed low BP expression A          representative RTPCR analysis of five tumors three with          matched normal tissue is shown in Fig  All of the          tumors shown are ERnegative and PRnegative Matched          normal and tumor tissues from three patients are shown in          lanes  and  patient   and  patient  and  and           patient  No BP expression was seen in the normal          samples lanes   and  whereas BP was expressed in          all of the tumors lanes   and  Two additional          tumor tissues shown in lanes  and  were positive for          BP matched samples were not available          To determine the significance of BP expression in the          tumor tissues clinicopathological data were related to          BP expression Table  No significant relationship was          detected between BP status and age tumor size or lymph          node metastasis Because year survival data were not          available for some patients we were not able to evaluate          survival outcome BP expression was significantly more          prevalent in ERnegative tumors of which  were          BPpositive compared with ERpositive tumors of which           were BPpositive            P   There was also a          significant difference in BP expression between          PRnegative tumors of which  were BPpositive and          PRpositive tumors of which  were BPpositive            P   BP expression was          associated with race it was expressed in  of the          tumors of African American women but in only  of the          tumors of Caucasian women            P   There was no significant          difference in BP expression between the three tumor          grades BP was expressed in  of grade I tumors           of grade II tumors and  of grade III tumors                            Discussion        In the present study we found that  of invasive        ductal breast tumors expressed BP a member of the DLX        homeobox gene family In contrast only  of normal        breast tissues expressed BP Our previous studies showed        that BP is also expressed in leukemia and has        characteristics of an oncogene in acute myeloid leukemia        BP is highly expressed in the bone marrow of  of        patients overall with a preponderance of expression in        pediatric patients     When overexpressed in a        leukemia cell line K BP increased the ability of        cells to grow in soft agar an indicator of leukemogenic        potential up to fold     Consistent with a        possible oncogenic role for BP in breast cancer was the        observation that its expression was correlated with the        ability of breast cancer cell lines to cause mammary tumors        in mice        Recent studies have shown that abrogation of BP        expression in a leukemia cell line leads to apoptosis        Davenport GJ Fu S Haga SB Do K Stevenson H Pinzone J        Chase MB Berg PE unpublished data Coupled with the        increased clonogenicity resulting from overexpression of        BP these observations suggest that the expression of BP        in breast tissue might also lead to increased survival and        conversely that the abrogation of BP expression in        malignant breast tissue could cause apoptosis of those        cells expressing BP        Estrogen and progesterone which stimulate the growth of        breast epithelium are two crucial hormones involved not        only in normal breast development but also in        carcinogenesis of breast epithelium and progression of        breast cancer     About  of breast cancers are        ERnegative     ERnegative tumors are unresponsive to        antiestrogen therapy probably because of constitutive        growth factor expression      In general these        tumors have a higher histologic grade and a higher        proliferative rate and are associated with poorer prognosis            The finding that  of ERnegative tumors        expressed BP might therefore be highly relevant to both        the prognosis and therapy of those difficulttotreat        tumors        It is well known that African American women have a        higher mortality rate from breast cancer than Caucasian        women reviewed by Mancino and colleagues            Although socioeconomic factors account for some of this        difference several recent studies have shown that the        median survival of African American women presenting with        Stage III or IV disease was significantly lower than that        of Caucasian women diagnosed at the same stage of disease        in Stage III disease the median survival was  months        for Caucasian patients and only  months for African        American patients whereas in Stage IV disease the median        survival was reduced to  months for Caucasian patients        and  months for African American patients             African American women also have a higher risk of        ERnegative tumors after adjustment is made for stage and        age at diagnosis These results have led to speculation        that there could be biological differences between African        American and Caucasian women that contribute to the        differences in outcome Interestingly more African        American women than Caucasian women were BPpositive          P   It will be important to        expand further the number of women studied to determine        whether BP expression might be one biological factor that        underlies survival differences between African American and        Caucasian women        Because BP was expressed in all tumor grades we        propose that it is activated in an early stage of malignant        development or even in a premalignant state We have        therefore begun to examine ductal carcinoma         in situ DCIS which are preinvasive        malignant lesions derived from epithelial cells and        fibroadenomas which are nonmalignant tumors composed of        epithelial and stromal cells      So far we have        analyzed one DCIS which was BPpositive and two        fibroadenomas both of which were BPpositive compared        with no expression in the matched normal tissue for each        fibroadenoma data not shown The sample number is very        small but the fact that any of the DCISs or fibroadenoma        tumors are positive for BP demonstrates that activation of        BP might be an early event perhaps promoting cell        survival as seems to occur in leukemia cells This idea is        also supported by the fact that BP is as likely to be        expressed in small tumors less than  cm as it is in        larger tumors  cm or more        The mechanism for overexpression of BP in breast cancer        is unknown However because of its map location at        q     the BP gene is a potential candidate for        DNA amplification which could lead to its activation or        overexpression This hypothesis is based on the fact that        two regions on chromosome q are sometimes amplified in        breast cancer one at q and another at q             The locus of BP is also near BRCA the        implications of this proximity are not yet known        To begin to identify genes that might be targets of BP        we have overexpressed BP in K cells and screened a        microarray Davenport GJ Fu S Haga SB Do K Stevenson H        Pinzone J Chase MB Berg PE unpublished data Although        K cells are derived from leukemia among the genes        showing altered regulation were several that are also        dysregulated in breast cancer including c         myc and cyclin D their altered        expression was verified by realtime PCR c         myc was upregulated in K cells        overexpressing BP and cMyc protein is highly expressed        in more than half of breast cancer patients     Cyclin        D downregulated on the array is repressed in breast        cancer     It will be important to determine whether        either of those genes is a target for BP in breast        cancer        These data strongly implicate BP in breast cancer More        case studies are underway to further strengthen our        findings and to determine whether there is a statistical        association between BP expression and prognosis or outcome        of breast cancer patients                    Conclusion        These data demonstrate a statistically significant        association between the expression of the transcription        factor BP not previously implicated in breast cancer and        ERnegative breast tumors This together with other        studies strongly suggests that BP has oncogenic        properties making it a new potential target in breast        tumors especially the difficulttotreat ERnegative        tumors Interestingly BP is expressed in  of        tumors including all grades This finding and the        observation that fibroadenomas nonmalignant tumors can        express BP strongly suggest that its activation might be        associated with loss of growth regulation which is        consistent with our molecular data
