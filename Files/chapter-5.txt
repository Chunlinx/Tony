                        AL QAEDA AIMS AT THE AMERICAN HOMELAND            TERRORIST ENTREPRENEURS            By early  al Qaeda was already a potent adversary of the United States Bin                Ladin and his chief of operations Abu Hafs al Masri also known as Mohammed Atef                occupied undisputed leadership positions atop al Qaedas organizational structure                Within this structure al Qaedas worldwide terrorist operations relied heavily on                the ideas and work of enterprising and strongwilled field commanders who enjoyed                considerable autonomy To understand how the organization actually worked and to                introduce the origins of the  plot we briefly examine three of these                subordinate commanders Khalid Sheikh Mohammed KSM Riduan Isamuddin better known                as Hambali and Abd al Rahim al Nashiri We will devote the most attention to                Khalid Sheikh Mohammed the chief manager of the planes operation Khalid Sheikh                Mohammed No one exemplifies the model of the terrorist entrepreneur more clearly                than Khalid Sheikh Mohammed the principal architect of the  attacks KSM                followed a rather tortuous path to his eventual membership in al Qaeda                        Highly educated and equally comfortable in a government office or a terrorist                safehouse KSM applied his imagination technical aptitude and managerial skills to                hatching and planning an extraordinary array of terrorist schemes These ideas                included conventional car bombing political assassination aircraft bombing                hijacking reservoir poisoning and ultimately the use of aircraft as missiles                guided by suicide operatives            Like his nephew Ramzi Yousef three years KSMs junior KSM grew up in Kuwait but                traces his ethnic lineage to the Baluchistan region straddling Iran and Pakistan                Raised in a religious family KSM claims to have joined the Muslim Brotherhood at                age  and to have become enamored of violent jihad at youth camps in the desert In                 following his graduation from secondary school KSM left Kuwait to enroll at                Chowan College a small Baptist school in Murfreesboro North Carolina After a                semester at Chowan KSM transferred to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical                State University in Greensboro which he attended with Yousef s brother another                future al Qaeda member KSM earned a degree in mechanical engineering in December                                            Although he apparently did not attract attention for extreme Islamist beliefs or                activities while in the United States KSM plunged into the antiSoviet Afghan jihad                soon after graduating from college Visiting Pakistan for the first time in early                 he traveled to Peshawar where his brother Zahid introduced him to the famous                Afghan mujahid Abdul Rasul Sayyaf head of the Hizbul Ittihad ElIslami Islamic                Union Party Sayyaf became KSMs mentor and provided KSM with military training at                Sayyaf s Sada camp KSM claims he then fought the Soviets and remained at the front                for three months before being summoned to perform administrative duties for Abdullah                Azzam KSM next took a job working for an electronics firm that catered to the                communications needs of Afghan groups where he learned about drills used to                excavate caves in Afghanistan                        Between  and  KSM helped run a nongovernmental organization NGO in                Peshawar and Jalalabad sponsored by Sayyaf it was designed to aid young Afghan                mujahideen In  KSM spent some time fighting alongside the mujahideen in Bosnia                and supporting that effort with financial donations After returning briefly to                Pakistan he moved his family to Qatar at the suggestion of the former minister of                Islamic affairs of Qatar Sheikh Abdallah bin Khalid bin Hamad al Thani KSM took a                position in Qatar as project engineer with the Qatari Ministry of Electricity and                Water Although he engaged in extensive international travel during his tenure at                the ministrymuch of it in furtherance of terrorist activityKSM would hold his                position there until early  when he fled to Pakistan to avoid capture by US                    authorities                        KSM first came to the attention of US law enforcement as a result of his cameo role                in the first World Trade Center bombing According to KSM he learned of Ramzi                Yousef s intention to launch an attack inside the United States in  or                 when Yousef was receiving explosives training in Afghanistan During the fall of                 while Yousef was building the bomb he would use in that attack KSM and Yousef                had numerous telephone conversations during which Yousef discussed his progress and                sought additional funding On November   KSM wired  from Qatar to the                bank account of Yousef s coconspirator Mohammed Salameh KSM does not appear to                have contributed any more substantially to this operation                        Yousef s instant notoriety as the mastermind of the  World Trade Center bombing                inspired KSM to become involved in planning attacks against the United States By                his own account KSMs animus toward the United States stemmed not from his                experiences there as a student but rather from his violent disagreement with US                foreign policy favoring Israel In  KSM accompanied Yousef to the Philippines                and the two of them began planning what is now known as the Manila air or Bojinka                plotthe intended bombing of  US commercial jumbo jets over the Pacific during a                twoday span This marked the first time KSM took part in the actual planning of a                terrorist operation While sharing an apartment in Manila during the summer of                 he and Yousef acquired chemicals and other materials necessary to construct bombs                and timers They also cased target flights to Hong Kong and Seoul that would have                onward legs to the United States During this same period KSM and Yousef also                developed plans to assassinate President Clinton during his November  trip to                Manila and to bomb USbound cargo carriers by smuggling jackets containing                nitrocellulose on board                        KSM left the Philippines in September  and met up with Yousef in Karachi                following their casing flights There they enlisted Wali Khan Amin Shah also known                as Usama Asmurai in the Manila air plot During the fall of  Yousef returned                to Manila and successfully tested the digital watch timer he had invented bombing a                movie theater and a Philippine Airlines flight en route to Tokyo The plot unraveled                after the Philippine authorities discovered Yousef s bombmaking operation in                Manila but by that time KSM was safely back at his government job in Qatar Yousef                attempted to follow through on the cargo carriers plan but he was arrested in                Islamabad by Pakistani authorities on February   after an accomplice turned                him in                        KSM continued to travel among the worldwide jihadist community after Yousef s                arrest visiting the Sudan Yemen Malaysia and Brazil in  No clear evidence                connects him to terrorist activities in those locations While in Sudan he                reportedly failed in his attempt to meet with Bin Ladin But KSM did see Atef who                gave him a contact in Brazil In January  well aware that US authorities were                chasing him he left Qatar for good and fled to Afghanistan where he renewed his                relationship with Rasul Sayyaf                        Just as KSM was reestablishing himself in Afghanistan in mid Bin Ladin and his                colleagues were also completing their migration from Sudan Through Atef KSM                arranged a meeting with Bin Ladin inTora Bora a mountainous redoubt from the Afghan                war days At the meeting KSM presented the al Qaeda leader with a menu of ideas for                terrorist operations According to KSM this meeting was the first time he had seen                Bin Ladin since  Although they had fought together in  Bin Ladin and KSM                did not yet enjoy an especially close working relationship Indeed KSM has                acknowledged that Bin Ladin likely agreed to meet with him because of the renown of                his nephew Yousef                        At the meeting KSM briefed Bin Ladin and Atef on the first World Trade Center                bombing the Manila air plot the cargo carriers plan and other activities pursued                by KSM and his colleagues in the Philippines KSM also presented a proposal for an                operation that would involve training pilots who would crash planes into buildings                in the United States This proposal eventually would become the  operation                        KSM knew that the successful staging of such an attack would require personnel                money and logistical support that only an extensive and wellfunded organization                like al Qaeda could provide He thought the operation might appeal to Bin Ladin who                had a long record of denouncing the United States                        From KSMs perspective Bin Ladin was in the process of consolidating his new                position in Afghanistan while hearing out others ideas and had not yet settled on                an agenda for future antiUS operations At the meeting Bin Ladin listened to                KSMs ideas without much comment but did ask KSM formally to join al Qaeda and move                his family to Afghanistan                        KSM declined He preferred to remain independent and retain the option of working                with other mujahideen groups still operating in Afghanistan including the group led                by his old mentor Sayyaf Sayyaf was close to Ahmed Shah Massoud the leader of the                Northern Alliance Therefore working with him might be a problem for KSM because Bin                Ladin was building ties to the rival Taliban            After meeting with Bin Ladin KSM says he journeyed onward to India Indonesia and                Malaysia where he met with Jemaah Islamiahs Hambali Hambali was an Indonesian                veteran of the Afghan war looking to expand the jihad into Southeast Asia In Iran                KSM rejoined his family and arranged to move them to Karachi he claims to have                relocated by January                         After settling his family in Karachi KSM tried to join the mujahid leader Ibn al                Khattab in Chechnya Unable to travel through Azerbaijan KSM returned to Karachi                and then to Afghanistan to renew contacts with Bin Ladin and his colleagues Though                KSM may not have been a member of al Qaeda at this time he admits traveling                frequently between Pakistan and Afghanistan in  and the first half of                 visiting Bin Ladin and cultivating relationships with his lieutenants Atef and Sayf                al Adl by assisting them with computer and media projects                        According to KSM the  bombings of the US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es                Salaam marked a watershed in the evolution of the  plot KSM claims these                bombings convinced him that Bin Ladin was truly committed to attacking the United                States He continued to make himself useful collecting news articles and helping                other al Qaeda members with their outdated computer equipment Bin Ladin apparently                at Atef s urging finally decided to give KSM the green light for the                 operation sometime in late  or early                         KSM then accepted Bin Ladins standing invitation to move to Kandahar and work                directly with al Qaeda In addition to supervising the planning and preparations for                the  operation KSM worked with and eventually led al Qaedas media committee                But KSM states he refused to swear a formal oath of allegiance to Bin Ladin thereby                retaining a last vestige of his cherished autonomy                        At this point late  to early  planning for the  operation began in                earnest Yet while the  project occupied the bulk of KSMs attention he                continued to consider other possibilities for terrorist attacks For example he                sent al Qaeda operative Issa al Britani to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia to learn about                the jihad in Southeast Asia from Hambali Thereafter KSM claims at Bin Ladins                direction in early  he sent Britani to the United States to case potential                economic and Jewish targets in New York City Furthermore during the summer of                 KSM approached Bin Ladin with the idea of recruiting a Saudi Arabian air force                pilot to commandeer a Saudi fighter jet and attack the Israeli city of Eilat Bin                Ladin reportedly liked this proposal but he instructed KSM to concentrate on the                 operation first Similarly KSMs proposals to Atef around this same time for                attacks in Thailand Singapore Indonesia and the Maldives were never executed                although Hambalis Jemaah Islamiah operatives did some casing of possible                    targets                        KSM appears to have been popular among the al Qaeda rank and file He was reportedly                regarded as an effective leader especially after the  attacks Coworkers                describe him as an intelligent efficient and eventempered manager who approached                his projects with a singleminded dedication that he expected his colleagues to                share Al Qaeda associate Abu Zubaydah has expressed more qualified admiration for                KSMs innate creativity emphasizing instead his ability to incorporate the                improvements suggested by others Nashiri has been similarly measured observing                that although KSM floated many general ideas for attacks he rarely conceived a                specific operation himself  Perhaps these estimates reflect a touch of jealousy                in any case KSM was plainly a capable coordinator having had years to hone his                skills and build relationships            Hambali            Al Qaedas success in fostering terrorism in Southeast Asia stems largely from its                close relationship with Jemaah Islamiah JI In that relationship Hambali became                the key coordinator Born and educated in Indonesia Hambali moved to Malaysia in                the early s to find work There he claims to have become a follower of the                Islamist extremist teachings of various clerics including one named Abdullah                Sungkar Sungkar first inspired Hambali to share the vision of establishing a                radical Islamist regime in Southeast Asia then furthered Hambalis instruction in                jihad by sending him to Afghanistan in  After undergoing training at Rasul                Sayyaf s Sada camp where KSM would later train Hambali fought against the                Soviets he eventually returned to Malaysia after  months in Afghanistan By                 Hambali would assume responsibility for the MalaysiaSingapore region within                Sungkars newly formed terrorist organization the JI                        Also by  Sungkar and JI spiritual leader Abu Bakar Bashir had accepted Bin                Ladins offer to ally JI with al Qaeda in waging war against Christians and                    Jews                        Hambali met with KSM in Karachi to arrange for JI members to receive training in                Afghanistan at al Qaedas camps In addition to his close working relationship with                KSM Hambali soon began dealing with Atef as well Al Qaeda began funding JIs                increasingly ambitious terrorist plans which Atef and KSM sought to expand Under                this arrangement JI would perform the necessary casing activities and locate                bombmaking materials and other supplies Al Qaeda would underwrite operations                provide bombmaking expertise and deliver suicide operatives                        The al QaedaJI partnership yielded a number of proposals that would marry al Qaedas                financial and technical strengths with JIs access to materials and local                operatives Here Hambali played the critical role of coordinator as he distributed                al Qaeda funds earmarked for the joint operations In one especially notable                example Atef turned to Hambali when al Qaeda needed a scientist to take over its                biological weapons program Hambali obliged by introducing a US educated JI                member Yazid Sufaat to Ayman al Zawahiri in Kandahar In  Sufaat would spend                several months attempting to cultivate anthrax for al Qaeda in a laboratory he                helped set up near the Kandahar airport                        Hambali did not originally orient JIs operations toward attacking the United States                but his involvement with al Qaeda appears to have inspired him to pursue American                targets KSM in his postcapture interrogations has taken credit for this shift                claiming to have urged the JI operations chief to concentrate on attacks designed to                hurt the US economy                        Hambalis newfound interest in striking against the United States manifested itself                in a spate of terrorist plans Fortunately none came to fruition            In addition to staging actual terrorist attacks in partnership with al Qaeda Hambali                and JI assisted al Qaeda operatives passing through Kuala Lumpur One important                occasion was in December January  Hambali accommodated KSMs requests to                help several veterans whom KSM had just finished training in Karachi They included                Tawfiq bin Attash also known as Khallad who later would help bomb the USS Cole                and future  hijackers Nawaf al Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar Hambali arranged                lodging for them and helped them purchase airline tickets for their onward travel                Later that year Hambali and his crew would provide accommodations and other                assistance including information on flight schools and help in acquiring ammonium                nitrate for Zacarias Moussaoui an al Qaeda operative sent to Malaysia by Atef and                    KSM                        Hambali used Bin Ladins Afghan facilities as a training ground for JI recruits                Though he had a close relationship with Atef and KSM he maintained JIs                institutional independence from al Qaeda Hambali insists that he did not discuss                operations with Bin Ladin or swear allegiance to him having already given such a                pledge of loyalty to Bashir Sungkars successor as JI leader Thus like any                powerful bureaucrat defending his domain Hambali objected when al Qaeda leadership                tried to assign JI members to terrorist projects without notifying him                        Abd al Rahim al Nashiri KSM and Hambali both decided to join forces with al Qaeda                because their terrorist aspirations required the money and manpower that only a                robust organization like al Qaeda could supply On the other hand Abd al Rahim al                Nashirithe mastermind of the Cole bombing and the eventual head of al Qaeda                operations in the Arabian Peninsulaappears to have originally been recruited to his                career as a terrorist by Bin Ladin himself            Having already participated in the Afghan jihad Nashiri accompanied a group of some                 mujahideen in pursuit of jihad in Tajikistan in  When serious fighting                failed to materialize the group traveled to Jalalabad and encountered Bin Ladin                who had recently returned from Sudan Bin Ladin addressed them at length urging the                group to join him in a jihad against the Americans Although all were urged to                swear loyalty to Bin Ladin many including Nashiri found the notion distasteful                and refused After several days of indoctrination that included a barrage of news                clippings and television documentaries Nashiri left Afghanistan first returning to                his native Saudi Arabia and then visiting his home in Yemen There he says the                idea for his first terrorist operation took shape as he noticed many US and other                foreign ships plying the waters along the southwest coast of Yemen                        Nashiri returned to Afghanistan probably in  primarily to check on relatives                fighting there and also to learn about the Taliban He again encountered Bin Ladin                still recruiting for the coming battle with the United States Nashiri pursued a                more conventional military jihad joining the Taliban forces in their fight against                Ahmed Massouds Northern Alliance and shuttling back and forth between the front and                Kandahar where he would see Bin Ladin and meet with other mujahideen During this                period Nashiri also led a plot to smuggle four Russianmade antitank missiles into                Saudi Arabia from Yemen in early  and helped an embassy bombing operative obtain                a Yemeni passport                        At some point Nashiri joined al Qaeda His cousin Jihad Mohammad Ali al Makki also                known as Azzam was a suicide bomber for the Nairobi attack Nashiri traveled                between Yemen and Afghanistan In late  Nashiri proposed mounting an attack                against a USvessel Bin Ladin approved He directed Nashiri to start the planning                and send operatives to Yemen and he later provided money                        Nashiri reported directly to Bin Ladin the only other person who according to                Nashiri knew all the details of the operation When Nashiri had difficulty finding                US naval vessels to attack along the western coast of Yemen Bin Ladin reportedly                instructed him to case the Port of Aden on the southern coast instead                        The eventual result was an attempted attack on the USS The Sullivans in January                 and the successful attack in October  on the USS Cole            Nashiris success brought him instant status within al Qaeda He later was recognized                as the chief of al Qaeda operations in and around the Arabian Peninsula While                Nashiri continued to consult Bin Ladin on the planning of subsequent terrorist                projects he retained discretion in selecting operatives and devising attacks In                the two years between the Cole bombing and Nashiris capture he would supervise                several more proposed operations for al Qaeda The October   bombing of the                French tanker Limburg in the Gulf of Aden also was Nashiris handiwork Although Bin                Ladin urged Nashiri to continue plotting strikes against US interests in the                Persian Gulf Nashiri maintains that he actually delayed one of these projects                because of security concernsThose concerns it seems were well placed as                Nashiris November  capture in the United Arab Emirates finally ended his career                as a terrorist            THE PLANES OPERATION            According to KSM he started to think about attacking the United States after Yousef                returned to Pakistan following the  World Trade Center bombing Like Yousef KSM                reasoned he could best influence US policy by targeting the countrys economy KSM                and Yousef reportedly brainstormed together about what drove the US economy New                York which KSM considered the economic capital of the United States therefore                became the primary target For similar reasons California also became a target for                    KSM                        KSM claims that the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center taught him that bombs                and explosives could be problematic and that he needed to graduate to a more novel                form of attack He maintains that he and Yousef began thinking about using aircraft                as weapons while working on the Manila airBojinka plot and speculated about                striking the World Trade Center and CIA headquarters as early as                         Certainly KSM was not alone in contemplating new kinds of terrorist operations A                study reportedly conducted by Atef while he and Bin Ladin were still in Sudan                concluded that traditional terrorist hijacking operations did not fit the needs of                al Qaeda because such hijackings were used to negotiate the release of prisoners                rather than to inflict mass casualties The study is said to have considered the                feasibility of hijacking planes and blowing them up in flight paralleling the                Bojinka concept Such a study if it actually existed yields significant insight                into the thinking of al Qaedas leaders  they rejected hijackings aimed at                gaining the release of imprisoned comrades as too complex because al Qaeda had no                friendly countries in which to land a plane and then negotiate  they considered                the bombing of commercial flights in midairas carried out against Pan Am Flight                 over Lockerbie Scotland a promising means to inflict massive casualties and                 they did not yet consider using hijacked aircraft as weapons against other                    targets                        KSM has insisted to his interrogators that he always contemplated hijacking and                crashing large commercial aircraft Indeed KSM describes a grandiose original plan                a total of ten aircraft to be hijacked nine of which would crash into targets on                both coaststhey included those eventually hit on September  plus CIA and FBI                headquarters nuclear power plants and the tallest buildings in California and the                state of Washington KSM himself was to land the tenth plane at a US airport and                after killing all adult male passengers on board and alerting the media deliver a                speech excoriating US support for Israel the Philippines and repressive                governments in the Arab world Beyond KSMs rationalizations about targeting the                US economy this vision gives a better glimpse of his true ambitions This is                theater a spectacle of destruction with KSM as the selfcast starthe                    superterrorist                        KSM concedes that this proposal received a lukewarm response from al Qaeda leaders                skeptical of its scale and complexity Although Bin Ladin listened to KSMs                proposal he was not convinced that it was practical As mentioned earlier Bin                Ladin was receiving numerous ideas for potential operations KSMs proposal to                attack US targets with commercial airplanes was only one of many                        KSM presents himself as an entrepreneur seeking venture capital and people He simply                wanted al Qaeda to supply the money and operatives needed for the attack while                retaining his independence It is easy to question such a statement Money is one                thing supplying a cadre of trained operatives willing to die is much more Thus                although KSM contends he would have been just as likely to consider working with any                comparable terrorist organization he gives no indication of what other groups he                thought could supply such exceptional commodities                        KSM acknowledges formally joining al Qaeda in late  or  and states that                soon afterward Bin Ladin also made the decision to support his proposal to attack                the United States using commercial airplanes as weapons Though KSM speculates about                how Bin Ladin came to share his preoccupation with attacking America Bin Ladin in                fact had long been an opponent of the United States KSM thinks that Atef may have                persuaded Bin Ladin to approve this specific proposal Atef s role in the entire                operation is unquestionably very significant but tends to fade into the background                in part because Atef himself is not available to describe it He was killed in                November  by an American air strike in Afghanistan                        Bin Ladin summoned KSM to Kandahar in March or April  to tell him that al Qaeda                would support his proposal The plot was now referred to within al Qaeda as the                planes operation                        The Plan Evolves            Bin Ladin reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of                meetings in the spring of  at the al Matar complex near Kandahar KSMs original                concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped                but Bin Ladin considered the basic idea feasible Bin Ladin Atef and KSM developed                an initial list of targets These included the White House the US Capitol the                Pentagon and the World Trade Center According to KSM Bin Ladin wanted to destroy                the White House and the Pentagon KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center and                all of them wanted to hit the Capitol No one else was involved in the initial                selection of targets                        Bin Ladin also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives Khalid                al Mihdhar Nawaf al Hazmi Khallad and Abu Bara al Yemeni During the al Matar                meetings Bin Ladin told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in                an operation against the United States that they had already obtained US visas                KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend                Azzam Nashiris cousin in carrying out the Nairobi bombing KSM had not met them                His only guidance from Bin Ladin was that the two should eventually go to the United                States for pilot training                        Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals born in Mecca Like the others in this                initial group of selectees they were already experienced mujahideen They had                traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in                 By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early                 they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions                        Khallad was another veteran mujahid like much of his family His father had been                expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views Khallad had grown up in Saudi                Arabia where his father knew Bin Ladin Abdullah Azzam and Omar Abdel Rahman the                Blind Sheikh Khallad departed for Afghanistan in  at the age of  Three                years later he lost his lower right leg in a battle with the Northern Alliance a                battle in which one of his brothers died After this experience he pledged                allegiance to Bin Ladinwhom he had first met as a child in Jeddahand volunteered                to become a suicide operative                        When Khallad applied for a US visa however his application was denied Earlier in                 Bin Ladin had sent Khallad to Yemen to help Nashiri obtain explosives for the                planned shipbombing and to obtain a visa to visit the United States so that he                could participate in an operation there Khallad applied under another name using                the cover story that he would be visiting a medical clinic to obtain a new                prosthesis for his leg Another al Qaeda operative gave Khallad the name of a person                living in the United States whom Khallad could use as a point of contact on a visa                application Khallad contacted this individual to help him get an appointment at a                US clinic While Khallad was waiting for the letter from the clinic confirming the                appointment however he was arrested by Yemeni authorities The arrest resulted                from mistaken identity Khallad was driving the car of another conspirator in the                shipbombing plot who was wanted by the Yemeni authorities                        Khallad was released sometime during the summer of  after his father and Bin                Ladin intervened on his behalf Khallad learned later that the al Qaeda leader                apparently concerned that Khallad might reveal Nashiris operation while under                interrogation had contacted a Yemeni official to demand Khallads release                suggesting that Bin Ladin would not confront the Yemenis if they did not confront                him This account has been corroborated by others Giving up on acquiring a US                visa and concerned that the United States might learn of his ties to al Qaeda                Khallad returned to Afghanistan                        Travel issues thus played a part in al Qaedas operational planning from the very                start During the spring and summer of  KSM realized that Khallad and Abu Bara                both of whom were Yemenis would not be able to obtain US visas as easily as Saudi                operatives like Mihdhar and Hazmi Although Khallad had been unable to acquire a                US visa KSM still wanted him and Abu Bara as well as another Yemeni operative                from Bin Ladins security detail to participate in the planes operation Yet                because individuals with Saudi passports could travel much more easily than Yemeni                particularly to the United States there were fewer martyrdom opportunities for                Yemenis To overcome this problem KSM decided to split the planes operation into                two components                        The first part of the planes operationcrashing hijacked aircraft into US                targetswould remain as planned with Mihdhar and Hazmi playing key roles The                second part however would now embrace the idea of using suicide operatives to blow                up planes a refinement of KSMs old Manila air plot The operatives would hijack                USflagged commercial planes flying Pacific routes across East Asia and destroy                them in midair possibly with shoe bombs instead of flying them into targets An                alternate scenario apparently involved flying planes into US targets in Japan                Singapore or Korea This part of the operation has been confirmed by Khallad who                said that they contemplated hijacking several planes probably originating in                Thailand South Korea Hong Kong or Malaysia and using Yemenis who would not need                pilot training because they would simply down the planes All the planes hijacked in                the United States and East Asia were to be crashed or exploded at about the same                time to maximize the attacks psychological impact                        Training and Deployment to Kuala Lumpur In the fall of  the four operatives                selected by Bin Ladin for the planes operation were chosen to attend an elite                training course at al Qaedas Mes Aynak camp in Afghanistan Bin Ladin personally                selected the veteran fighters who received this training and several of them were                destined for important operations One example is Ibrahim al Thawar or Nibras who                would participate in the October   suicide attack on the USS Cole According                to KSM this training was not given specifically in preparation for the planes                operation or any other particular al Qaeda venture Although KSM claims not to have                been involved with the training or to have met with the future  hijackers at Mes                Aynak he says he did visit the camp while traveling from Kandahar to Kabul with Bin                Ladin and others                        The Mes Aynak training camp was located in an abandoned Russian copper mine near                Kabul The camp opened in  after the United States had destroyed the training                camp near Khowst with cruise missiles in August  and before theTaliban granted                al Qaeda permission to open the al Faruq camp in Kandahar Thus for a brief period                in  Mes Aynak was the only al Qaeda camp operating in Afghanistan It offered a                full range of instruction including an advanced commando course taught by senior al                Qaeda member Sayf al Adl Bin Ladin paid particular attention to the  training                session When Salah al Din the trainer for the session complained about the number                of trainees and said that no more than  could be handled at once Bin Ladin                insisted that everyone he had selected receive the training                        The special training session at Mes Aynak was rigorous and spared no expense The                course focused on physical fitness firearms close quarters combat shooting from a                motorcycle and night operations Although the subjects taught differed little from                those offered at other camps the course placed extraordinary physical and mental                demands on its participants who received the best food and other amenities to                enhance their strength and morale                        Upon completing the advanced training at Mes Aynak Hazmi Khallad and Abu Bara went                to Karachi Pakistan There KSM instructed them on Western culture and travel Much                of his activity in mid had revolved around the collection of training and                informational materials for the participants in the planes operation For instance                he collected Western aviation magazines telephone directories for American cities                such as San Diego and Long Beach California brochures for schools and airline                timetables and he conducted Internet searches on US flight schools He also                purchased flight simulator software and a few movies depicting hijackings To house                his students KSM rented a safehouse in Karachi with money provided by Bin                    Ladin                        In early December  Khallad and Abu Bara arrived in Karachi Hazmi joined them                there a few days later On his way to Karachi Hazmi spent a night in Quetta at a                safehouse where according to KSM an Egyptian named Mohamed Atta simultaneously                stayed on his way to Afghanistan for jihad training                        Mihdhar did not attend the training in Karachi with the others KSM says that he                never met with Mihdhar in  but assumed that Bin Ladin and Atef had briefed                Mihdhar on the planes operation and had excused him from the Karachi training                        The course in Karachi apparently lasted about one or two weeks According to KSM he                taught the three operatives basic English words and phrases He showed them how to                read phone books interpret airline timetables use the Internet use code words in                communications make travel reservations and rent an apartment Khallad adds that                the training involved using flight simulator computer games viewing movies that                featured hijackings and reading flight schedules to determine which flights would                be in the air at the same time in different parts of the world They used the game                software to increase their familiarity with aircraft models and functions and to                highlight gaps in cabin security While in Karachi they also discussed how to case                flights in Southeast Asia KSM told them to watch the cabin doors at takeoff and                landing to observe whether the captain went to the lavatory during the flight and                to note whether the flight attendants brought food into the cockpit KSM Khallad                and Hazmi also visited travel agencies to learn the visa requirements for Asian                    countries                        The four trainees traveled to Kuala Lumpur Khallad Abu Bara and Hazmi came from                Karachi Mihdhar traveled from Yemen As discussed in chapter  US intelligence                would analyze communications associated with Mihdhar whom they identified during                this travel and Hazmi whom they could have identified but did not                        According to KSM the four operatives were aware that they had volunteered for a                suicide operation either in the United States or in Asia With different roles                they had different tasks Hazmi and Mihdhar were sent to Kuala Lumpur before                proceeding to their final destinationthe United States According to KSM they were                to use Yemeni documents to fly to Malaysia then proceed to the United States using                their Saudi passports to conceal their prior travels to and from Pakistan KSM had                doctored Hazmis Saudi passport so it would appear as if Hazmi had traveled to Kuala                Lumpur from Saudi Arabia via Dubai Khallad and Abu Bara went to Kuala Lumpur to                study airport security and conduct casing flights According to Khallad he and Abu                Bara departed for Malaysia in midDecember  Hazmi joined them about ten days                later after briefly returning to Afghanistan to attend to some passport issues                        Khallad had originally scheduled his trip in order to receive a new prosthesis at a                Kuala Lumpur clinic called Endolite and Bin Ladin suggested that he use the                opportunity to case flights as well According to Khallad Malaysia was an ideal                destination because its government did not require citizens of Saudi Arabia or other                Gulf states to have a visa Malaysian security was reputed to be lax when it came to                Islamist jihadists Also other mujahideen wounded in combat had reportedly received                treatment at the Endolite clinic and successfully concealed the origins of their                injuries Khallad said he got the money for the prosthesis from his father Bin                Ladin and another al Qaeda colleague                        According to Khallad when he and Abu Bara arrived in Kuala Lumpur they contacted                Hambali to let him know where they were staying since he was to be kept informed of                al Qaeda activities in Southeast Asia Hambali picked up Khallad and Abu Bara and                brought them to his home enlisting the help of a colleague who spoke better Arabic                Hambali then took them to the clinic                        On December  Khallad flew from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok the next day he flew to                Hong Kong aboard a US airliner He flew in first class which he realized was a                mistake because this seating assignment on that flight did not afford him a view of                the cockpit He claims to have done what he could to case the flight testing                security by carrying a box cutter in his toiletries kit onto the flight to Hong                Kong Khallad returned to Bangkok the following day At the airport the security                officials searched his carryon bag and even opened the toiletries kit but just                glanced at the contents and let him pass On this flight Khallad waited until most                of the firstclass passengers were dozing then got up and removed the kit from his                carryon None of the flight attendants took notice                        After completing his casing mission Khallad returned to Kuala Lumpur Hazmi arrived                in Kuala Lumpur soon thereafter and may even have stayed briefly with Khallad and                Abu Bara at Endolite Mihdhar arrived on January  probably one day after Hazmi                All four operatives stayed at the apartment of Yazid Sufaat the Malaysian JI member                who made his home available at Hambalis request According to Khallad he and Hazmi                spoke about the possibility of hijacking planes and crashing them or holding                passengers as hostages but only speculatively Khallad admits being aware at the                time that Hazmi and Mihdhar were involved in an operation involving planes in the                United States but denies knowing details of the plan                        While in Kuala Lumpur Khallad wanted to go to Singapore to meet Nibras and Fahd al                Quso two of the operatives in Nashiris shipbombing operation An attempt to                execute that plan by attacking the USS The Sullivans had failed just a few days                earlier Nibras and Quso were bringing Khallad money from Yemen but were stopped in                Bangkok because they lacked visas to continue on to Singapore Also unable to enter                Singapore Khallad moved the meeting to Bangkok Hazmi and Mihdhar decided to go                there as well reportedly because they thought it would enhance their cover as                tourists to have passport stamps from a popular tourist destination such as                Thailand With Hambalis help the three obtained tickets for a flight to Bangkok                and left Kuala Lumpur together Abu Bara did not have a visa permitting him to                return to Pakistan so he traveled to Yemen instead                        In Bangkok Khallad took Hazmi and Mihdhar to one hotel then went to another hotel                for his meeting on the maritime attack plan Hazmi and Mihdhar soon moved to that                same hotel but Khallad insists that the two sets of operatives never met with each                other or anyone else After conferring with the shipbombing operatives Khallad                returned to Karachi and then to Kandahar where he reported on his casing mission to                Bin Ladin                        Bin Ladin canceled the East Asia part of the planes operation in the spring of                 He evidently decided it would be too difficult to coordinate this attack with the                operation in the United States As for Hazmi and Mihdhar they had left Bangkok a                few days before Khallad and arrived in Los Angeles on January                          Meanwhile the next group of al Qaeda operatives destined for the planes operation                had just surfaced in Afghanistan As Hazmi and Mihdhar were deploying from Asia to                the United States al Qaedas leadership was recruiting and training four                Westerneducated men who had recently arrived in Kandahar Though they hailed from                four different countriesEgypt the United Arab Emirates Lebanon and Yementhey                had formed a closeknit group as students in Hamburg Germany The new recruits had                come to Afghanistan aspiring to wage jihad in Chechnya But al Qaeda quickly                recognized their potential and enlisted them in its antiUS jihad            THE HAMBURG CONTINGENT            Although Bin Ladin Atef and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda                members to execute the planes operation the late  arrival in Kandahar of four                aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative                The Hamburg group shared the antiUS fervor of the other candidates for the                operation but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity                with life in the West based on years that each member of the group had spent living                in Germany Not surprisingly Mohamed Atta Ramzi Binalshibh Marwan al Shehhi and                Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the  conspiracy            Mohamed Atta            Mohamed Atta was born on September   in Kafr el Sheikh Egypt to a                middleclass family headed by his father an attorney After graduating from Cairo                University with a degree in architectural engineering in  Atta worked as an                urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years In the fall of  he asked a German                family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany They                suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there at least                initially After completing a course in German Atta traveled to Germany for the                first time in July  He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then in the fall of                 moved to Hamburg to live with his host family After enrolling at the                University of Hamburg he promptly transferred into the city engineering and                planning course at the Technical University of HamburgHarburg where he would                remain registered as a student until the fall of  He appears to have applied                himself fairly seriously to his studies at least in comparison to his jihadist                friends and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan                In school Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant with an                excellent command of the German language                        When Atta arrived in Germany he appeared religious but not fanatically so This                would change especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly                pronounced According to Binalshibh as early as  Atta sought to organize a                Muslim student association in Hamburg In the fall of  he joined a working                group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg a group designed to bridge the gap between                Muslims and Christians Atta proved a poor bridge however because of his abrasive                and increasingly dogmatic personality But among those who shared his beliefs Atta                stood out as a decisionmaker Attas friends during this period remember him as                charismatic intelligent and persuasive albeit intolerant of dissent                        In his interactions with other students Atta voiced virulently antiSemitic and                antiAmerican opinions ranging from condemnations of what he described as a global                Jewish movement centered in New York City that supposedly controlled the financial                world and the media to polemics against governments of the Arab world To him                Saddam Hussein was an American stooge set up to give Washington an excuse to                intervene in the Middle East Within his circle Atta advocated violent jihad He                reportedly asked one individual close to the group if he was ready to fight for                his belief and dismissed him as too weak for jihad when the person declined On a                visit home to Egypt in  Atta met one of his college friends According to this                friend Atta had changed a great deal had grown a beard and had obviously adopted                fundamentalism by that time                        Ramzi Binalshibh            Ramzi Binalshibh was born on May  in Ghayl Bawazir Yemen There does not seem                to be anything remarkable about his family or early background A friend who knew                Binalshibh in Yemen remembers him as religious but not too religious From                 to  Binalshibh worked as a clerk for the International Bank of Yemen He first                attempted to leave Yemen in  when he applied for a US visa After his                application was rejected he went to Germany and applied for asylum under the name                Ramzi Omar claiming to be a Sudanese citizen seeking asylum While his asylum                petition was pending Binalshibh lived in Hamburg and associated with individuals                from several mosques there In  after his asylum application was denied                Binalshibh went home to Yemen but returned to Germany shortly thereafter under his                true name this time registering as a student in Hamburg Binalshibh continually had                academic problems failing tests and cutting classes he was expelled from one                school in September                         According to Binalshibh he and Atta first met at a mosque in Hamburg in  The                two men became close friends and became identified with their shared extremist                outlook Like Atta by the late s Binalshibh was decrying what he perceived to                be a Jewish world conspiracy He proclaimed that the highest duty of every Muslim                was to pursue jihad and that the highest honor was to die during the jihad Despite                his rhetoric however Binalshibh presented a more amiable figure than the austere                Atta and was known within the community as being sociable extroverted polite and                    adventuresome                        In  Binalshibh and Atta began sharing an apartment in the Harburg section of                Hamburg together with a young student from the United Arab Emirates named Marwan al                    Shehhi                        Marwan al Shehhi            Marwan al Shehhi was born on May   in Ras al Khaimah the United Arab                Emirates His father who died in  was a prayer leader at the local mosque                After graduating from high school in  Shehhi joined the Emirati military and                received half a year of basic training before gaining admission to a military                scholarship program that would fund his continued study in Germany                        Shehhi first entered Germany in April  After sharing an apartment in Bonn for                two months with three other scholarship students Shehhi moved in with a German                family with whom he resided for several months before moving into his own                apartment During this period he came across as very religious praying five times                a day Friends also remember him as convivial and a regular guywearing Western                clothes and occasionally renting cars for trips to Berlin France and the                    Netherlands                        As a student Shehhi was less than a success Upon completing a course in German he                enrolled at the University of Bonn in a program for technical mathematical and                scientific studies In June  he requested a leave from his studies citing the                need to attend to unspecified problems in his home country Although the                university denied his request Shehhi left anyway and consequently was compelled to                repeat the first semester of his studies In addition to having academic                difficulties at this time Shehhi appeared to become more extreme in the practice of                his faith for example he specifically avoided restaurants that cooked with or                served alcohol In late  he applied for permission to complete his course work                in Hamburg a request apparently motivated by his desire to join Atta and                Binalshibh Just how and when the three of them first met remains unclear although                they seemed to know each other already when Shehhi relocated to Hamburg in early                 Atta and Binalshibh moved into his apartment in April                        The transfer to Hamburg did not help Shehhis academic progress he was directed by                the scholarship program administrators at the Emirati embassy to repeat his second                semester starting in August  but back in Bonn Shehhi initially flouted this                directive however and did not reenroll at the University of Bonn until the                following January barely passing his course there By the end of July  he had                returned to Hamburg applying to study shipbuilding at the Technical University and                more significantly residing once again with Atta and Binalshibh in an apartment at                 Marienstrasse                        After Shehhi moved in with Atta and Binalshibh his evolution toward Islamic                fundamentalism became more pronounced A fellow Emirati student who came to Hamburg                to visit Shehhi noticed he no longer lived as comfortably as before Shehhi now                occupied an old apartment with a roommate had no television and wore inexpensive                clothes When asked why he was living so frugally Shehhi responded that he was                living the way the Prophet had lived                        Similarly when someone asked why he and Atta never laughed Shehhi retorted How                can you laugh when people are dying in Palestine                        Ziad Jarrah            Born on May   in Mazraa Lebanon Ziad Jarrah came from an affluent family                and attended private Christian schools Like Atta Binalshibh and Shehhi Jarrah                aspired to pursue higher education in Germany In April  he and a cousin                enrolled at a junior college in Greifswald in northeastern Germany There Jarrah                met and became intimate with Aysel Senguen the daughter of Turkish immigrants who                was preparing to study dentistry                        Even with the benefit of hindsight Jarrah hardly seems a likely candidate for                becoming an Islamic extremist Far from displaying radical beliefs when he first                moved to Germany he arrived with a reputation for knowing where to find the best                discos and beaches in Beirut and in Greifswald was known to enjoy student parties                and drinking beer Although he continued to share an apartment in Greifswald with                his cousin Jarrah was mostly at Senguens apartment Witnesses interviewed by                German authorities after  however recall that Jarrah started showing signs of                radicalization as early as the end of  After returning from a trip home to                Lebanon Jarrah started living more strictly according to the Koran He read                brochures in Arabic about jihad held forth to friends on the subject of holy war                and professed disaffection with his previous life and a desire not to leave the                world in a natural way                        In September  Jarrah abruptly switched his intended course of study from                dentistry to aircraft engineeringat the Technical University of HamburgHarburg                His motivation for this decision remains unclear The rationale he expressed to                Senguenthat he had been interested in aviation since playing with toy airplanes as                a childrings somewhat hollow In any event Jarrah appears already to have had                Hamburg contacts by this time some of whom may have played a role in steering him                toward Islamic extremism                        Following his move to Hamburg that fall he began visiting Senguen in Greifswald on                weekends until she moved to the German city of Bochum one year later to enroll in                dental school Around the same time he began speaking increasingly about religion                and his visits to Senguen became less and less frequent He began criticizing her                for not being religious enough and for dressing too provocatively He grew a full                beard and started praying regularly He refused to introduce her to his Hamburg                friends because he told her they were religious Muslims and her refusal to become                more observant embarrassed him At some point in  Jarrah told Senguen that he                was planning to wage a jihad because there was no greater honor than to die for                Allah Although Jarrahs transformation generated numerous quarrels their breakups                invariably were followed by reconciliation                        Forming a Cell            In Hamburg Jarrah had a succession of living accommodations but he apparently never                resided with his future coconspirators It is not clear how and when he became part                of Attas circle He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him                at the Quds mosque in Hamburg which Jarrah began attending regularly in late                 The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken flamboyant Islamist named                Mohammed Haydar Zammar A wellknown figure in the Muslim community and to German                and US intelligence agencies by the late s Zammar had fought in Afghanistan                and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad Indeed a                witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage                jihad Moreover after  Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just                Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group In  Zammar encouraged them to                participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan                        Owing to Zammars persuasion or some other source of inspiration Atta Binalshibh                Shehhi and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist                beliefs into action By late  they were ready to abandon their student lives in                Germany in favor of violent jihad This final stage in their evolution toward                embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around                them The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims often hosting                sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely antiAmerican                discussions Meeting three to four times a week the group became something of a                sect whose members according to one participant in the meetings tended to deal                only with each other                        Attas rent checks for the apartment provide evidence of the importance that the                apartment assumed as a center for the group as he would write on them the notation                Dar el Ansar or house of the followers                        In addition to Atta Binalshibh Shehhi and Jarrah the group included other                extremists some of whom also would attend al Qaeda training camps and in some                instances would help the  hijackers as they executed the plot                            Said Bahaji son of a Moroccan immigrant was the only German citizen in the                    group Educated in Morocco Bahaji returned to Germany to study electrical                    engineering at the Technical University of HamburgHarburg He spent five months                    in the German army before obtaining a medical discharge and lived with Atta and                    Binalshibh at  Marienstrasse for eight months between November  and July                     Described as an insecure follower with no personality and with limited                    knowledge of Islam Bahaji nonetheless professed his readiness to engage in                    violence Atta and Binalshibh used Bahajis computer for Internet research as                    evidenced by documents and diskettes seized by German authorities after                                                        Zakariya Essabar a Moroccan citizen moved to Germany in February  and to                    Hamburg in  where he studied medical technology Soon after moving to                    Hamburg Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque Essabar                    turned extremist fairly suddenly probably in  and reportedly pressured one                    acquaintance with physical force to become more religious grow a beard and                    compel his wife to convert to Islam Essabars parents were said to have made                    repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle Shortly                    before the  attacks he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date                    for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership                                Mounir el Motassadeq another Moroccan came to Germany in  moving to                    Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical                    University A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his                    entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it One of Motassadeqs                    roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a good man and organizing film                    sessions that included speeches by Bin Ladin Motassadeq would help conceal the                    Hamburg groups trip to Afghanistan in late                                 Abdelghani Mzoudi also a Moroccan arrived in Germany in the summer of                     after completing university courses in physics and chemistry Mzoudi studied in                    Dortmund Bochum and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in  Mzoudi                    described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco but much more                    devout when he was back in Hamburg In April  Mzoudi and Motassadeq                    witnessed the execution of Attas will                                        During the course of  Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive                speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations  When the                four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late                that year it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation no                evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time Witnesses have attested                however that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some                action against the United States                        In short they fit the bill for Bin Ladin Atef and KSM            Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in  Atta Binalshibh                Shehhi and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians According to                Binalshibh a chance meeting on a train in Germany caused the group to travel to                Afghanistan instead An individual named Khalid al Masri approached Binalshibh and                Shehhi because they were Arabs with beards Binalshibh thinks and struck up a                conversation about jihad in Chechnya When they later called Masri and expressed                interest in going to Chechnya he told them to contact Abu Musab in Duisburg                Germany Abu Musab turned out to be Mohamedou Ould Slahi a significant al Qaeda                operative who even then was well known to US and German intelligence though                neither government apparently knew he was operating in Germany in late  When                telephoned by Binalshibh and Shehhi Slahi reportedly invited these promising                recruits to come see him in Duisburg                        Binalshibh Shehhi and Jarrah made the trip When they arrived Slahi explained that                it was difficult to get to Chechnya at that time because many travelers were being                detained in Georgia He recommended they go to Afghanistan instead where they could                train for jihad before traveling onward to Chechnya Slahi instructed them to obtain                Pakistani visas and then return to him for further directions on how to reach                Afghanistan Although Atta did not attend the meeting he joined in the plan with                the other three After obtaining the necessary visas they received Slahis final                instructions on how to travel to Karachi and then Quetta where they were to contact                someone named Umar al Masri at the Taliban office                        Following Slahis advice Atta and Jarrah left Hamburg during the last week of                November  bound for Karachi Shehhi left for Afghanistan around the same time                Binalshibh about two weeks later Binalshibh remembers that when he arrived at the                Taliban office in Quetta there was no one named Umar al Masri The name                apparently was simply a code a group of Afghans from the office promptly escorted                him to Kandahar There Binalshibh rejoined Atta and Jarrah who said they already                had pledged loyalty to Bin Ladin and urged him to do the same They also informed                him that Shehhi had pledged as well and had already left for the United Arab                Emirates to prepare for the mission Binalshibh soon met privately with Bin Ladin                accepted the al Qaeda leaders invitation to work under him and added his own                pledge to those of his Hamburg colleagues By this time Binalshibh claims he                assumed he was volunteering for a martyrdom operation                        Atta Jarrah and Binalshibh then met with Atef who told them they were about to                undertake a highly secret mission As Binalshibh tells it Atef instructed the three                to return to Germany and enroll in flight training Atta whom Bin Ladin chose to                lead the groupmet with Bin Ladin several times to receive additional instructions                including a preliminary list of approved targets the World Trade Center the                Pentagon and the US Capitol                        The new recruits also learned that an individual named Rabia al Makki Nawaf al                Hazmi would be part of the operation                        In retrospect the speed with which Atta Shehhi Jarrah and Binalshibh became core                members of the  plotwith Atta designated its operational leaderis remarkable                They had not yet met with KSM when all this occurred It is clear then that Bin                Ladin and Atef were very much in charge of the operation That these candidates were                selected so quicklybefore comprehensive testing in the training camps or in                operationsdemonstrates that Bin Ladin and Atef probably already understood the                deficiencies of their initial team Hazmi and Mihdhar The new recruits from Germany                possessed an ideal combination of technical skill and knowledge that the original                 operatives veteran fighters though they were lacked Bin Ladin and Atef                wasted no time in assigning the Hamburg group to the most ambitious operation yet                planned by al Qaeda            Bin Ladin and Atef also plainly judged that Atta was best suited to be the tactical                commander of the operation Such a quick and critical judgment invites speculation                about whether they had already taken Attas measure at some earlier meeting To be                sure some gaps do appear in the record of Attas known whereabouts during the                preceding years One such gap is FebruaryMarch  a period for which there is no                evidence of his presence in Germany and when he conceivably could have been in                    Afghanistan                        Yet to date neither KSM Binalshibh nor any other al Qaeda figure interrogated                about the  plot has claimed that Atta or any other member of the Hamburg group                traveled to Afghanistan before the trip in late             While the four core Hamburg cell members were in Afghanistan their associates back                in Hamburg handled their affairs so that their trip could be kept secret Motassadeq                appears to have done the most He terminated Shehhis apartment lease telling the                landlord that Shehhi had returned to the UAE for family reasons and used a power of                attorney to pay bills from Shehhis bank account                        Motassadeq also assisted Jarrah offering to look after Aysel Senguen in Jarrahs                absence Said Bahaji attended to similar routine matters for Atta and Binalshibh                thereby helping them remain abroad without drawing attention to their absence                        Preparing for the Operation            In early  Atta Jarrah and Binalshibh returned to Hamburg Jarrah arrived                first on January   According to Binalshibh he and Atta left Kandahar                together and proceeded first to Karachi where they met KSM and were instructed by                him on security and on living in the United States Shehhi apparently had already                met with KSM before returning to the UAE Atta returned to Hamburg in late February                and Binalshibh arrived shortly thereafter Shehhis travels took him to the UAE                where he acquired a new passport and a US visa Saudi Arabia Bahrain and one                or more other destinations Shehhi also returned to Germany possibly sometime in                    March                        After leaving Afghanistan the hijackers made clear efforts to avoid appearing                radical Once back in Hamburg they distanced themselves from conspicuous extremists                like Zammar whom they knew attracted unwanted attention from the authorities                        They also changed their appearance and behavior Atta wore Western clothing shaved                his beard and no longer attended extremist mosques Jarrah also no longer wore a                full beard and according to Senguen acted much more the way he had when she first                met him And when Shehhi while still in the UAE in January  held a belated                wedding celebration he actually had been married in  a friend of his was                surprised to see that he had shaved off his beard and was acting like his old self                    again                        But Jarrahs apparent efforts to appear less radical did not completely conceal his                transformation from his Lebanese family which grew increasingly concerned about his                fanaticism Soon after Jarrah returned to Germany his father asked Jarrahs                cousina close companion from boyhoodto intercede The cousins ensuing effort to                persuade Jarrah to depart from the path he was taking proved unavailingYet                Jarrah clearly differed from the other hijackers in that he maintained much closer                contact with his family and continued his intimate relationship with Senguen These                ties may well have caused him to harbor some doubts about going through with the                plot even as late as the summer of  as discussed in chapter             After leaving Afghanistan the four began researching flight schools and aviation                training In early January  Ali Abdul Aziz Alia nephew of KSM living in the                UAE who would become an important facilitator in the plot used Shehhis credit card                to order a Boeing  flight simulator program and a Boeing  flight deck                video together with attendant literature Ali had all these items shipped to his                employers address Jarrah soon decided that the schools in Germany were not                acceptable and that he would have to learn to fly in the United States Binalshibh                also researched flight schools in Europe and in the Netherlands he met a flight                school director who recommended flight schools in the United States because they                were less expensive and required shorter training periods                        In March  Atta emailed  different US flight schools on behalf of a small                group of men from various Arab countries studying in Germany who while lacking                prior training were interested in learning to fly in the United States Atta                requested information about the cost of the training potential financing and                    accommodations                        Before seeking visas to enter the United States Atta Shehhi and Jarrah obtained                new passports each claiming that his old passport had been lost Presumably they                were concerned that the Pakistani visas in their old passports would raise                suspicions about possible travel to Afghanistan Shehhi obtained his visa on January                  Atta on May  and Jarrah on May                         Binalshibhs visa request was rejected however as were his three subsequent                applications  Binalshibh proved unable to obtain a visa a victim of the                generalized suspicion that visa applicants from Yemenespecially young men applying                in another country Binalshibh first applied in Berlinmight join the ranks of                undocumented aliens seeking work in the United States Before  security                concerns were not a major factor in visa issuance unless the applicant already was                on a terrorist watchlist and none of these four men was Concerns that Binalshibh                intended to immigrate to the United States doomed his chances to participate                firsthand in the  attacks Although Binalshibh had to remain behind he would                provide critical assistance from abroad to his coconspirators            Once again the need for travel documents dictated al Qaedas plans            Travel            It should by now be apparent how significant travel was in the planning undertaken by                a terrorist organization as farflung as al Qaeda The story of the plot includes                references to dozens of international trips Operations required travel as did                basic communications and the movement of money Where electronic communications were                regarded as insecure al Qaeda relied even more heavily on couriers            KSM and Abu Zubaydah each played key roles in facilitating travel for al Qaeda                operatives In addition al Qaeda had an office of passports and host country issues                under its security committee The office was located at the Kandahar airport and was                managed by Atef The committee altered papers including passports visas and                identification cards                        Moreover certain al Qaeda members were charged with organizing passport collection                schemes to keep the pipeline of fraudulent documents flowing To this end al Qaeda                required jihadists to turn in their passports before going to the front lines in                Afghanistan If they were killed their passports were recycled for use                        The operational mission training course taught operatives how to forge documents                Certain passport alteration methods which included substituting photos and erasing                and adding travel cachets were also taught Manuals demonstrating the technique for                cleaning visas were reportedly circulated among operatives Mohamed Atta and                Zakariya Essabar were reported to have been trained in passport alteration                        The purpose of all this training was twofold to develop an institutional capacity                for document forgery and to enable operatives to make necessary adjustments in the                field It was wellknown for example that if a Saudi traveled to Afghanistan via                Pakistan then on his return to Saudi Arabia his passport bearing a Pakistani                stamp would be confiscated So operatives either erased the Pakistani visas from                their passports or traveled through Iran which did not stamp visas directly into                    passports                        A MONEY TRAIL            Bin Ladin and his aides did not need a very large sum to finance their planned attack                on America The  plotters eventually spent somewhere between  and                 to plan and conduct their attack Consistent with the importance of the                project al Qaeda funded the plotters KSM provided his operatives with nearly all                the money they needed to travel to the United States train and live The plotters                tradecraft was not especially sophisticated but it was good enough They moved                stored and spent their money in ordinary ways easily defeating the detection                mechanisms in place at the time                        The origin of the funds remains unknown although we have a general idea of how al                Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to             General Financing            As we explained in chapter  Bin Ladin did not fund al Qaeda through a personal                fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan Instead al Qaeda relied primarily on                a fundraising network developed over time The CIA now estimates that it cost al                Qaeda about  million per year to sustain its activities before  and that this                money was raised almost entirely through donations                        For many years the United States thought Bin Ladin financed al Qaedas expenses                through a vast personal inheritance Bin Ladin purportedly inherited approximately                 million when his father died and was rumored to have had access to these funds                to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position                in al Qaeda In early  the US government discovered a different reality                roughly from  through  Bin Ladin received about  million per yeara                significant sum to be sure but not a  million fortune that could be used to                fund jihad                        Then as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the s the Bin Ladin                family was forced to find a buyer for Usamas share of the family company in                 The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale This action had                the effect of divesting Bin Ladin of what otherwise might indeed have been a large                    fortune                        Nor were Bin Ladins assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda When Bin Ladin                lived in Sudan from  to  he owned a number of businesses and other assets                These could not have provided significant income as most were small or not                economically viable When Bin Ladin left in  it appears that the Sudanese                government expropriated all his assets he left Sudan with practically nothing When                Bin Ladin arrived in Afghanistan he relied on the Taliban until he was able to                reinvigorate his fundraising efforts by drawing on ties to wealthy Saudi                individuals that he had established during the Afghan war in the s                        Al Qaeda appears to have relied on a core group of financial facilitators who raised                money from a variety of donors and other fundraisers primarily in the Gulf                countries and particularly in Saudi Arabia                        Some individual donors surely knew and others did not the ultimate destination of                their donations Al Qaeda and its friends took advantage of Islams strong calls for                charitable giving zakat These financial facilitators also appeared to rely heavily                on certain imams at mosques who were willing to divert zakat donations to al Qaedas                    cause                        Al Qaeda also collected money from employees of corrupt charities                        It took two approaches to using charities for fundraising One was to rely on al                Qaeda sympathizers in specific foreign branch offices of large international                charitiesparticularly those with lax external oversight and ineffective internal                controls such as the Saudibased al Haramain Islamic Foundation                        Smaller charities in various parts of the globe were funded by these large Gulf                charities and had employees who would siphon the money to al Qaeda                        In addition entire charities such as the al Wafa organization may have wittingly                participated in funneling money to al Qaeda In those cases al Qaeda operatives                controlled the entire organization including access to bank accounts                        Charities were a source of money and also provided significant cover which enabled                operatives to travel undetected under the guise of working for a humanitarian                organization            It does not appear that any government other than the Taliban financially supported                al Qaeda before  although some governments may have contained al Qaeda                sympathizers who turned a blind eye to al Qaedas fundraising activities                        Saudi Arabia has long been considered the primary source of al Qaeda funding but we                have found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi                officials individually funded the organization This conclusion does not exclude                the likelihood that charities with significant Saudi government sponsorship diverted                funds to al Qaeda Still al Qaeda found fertile fundraising ground in Saudi                Arabia where extreme religious views are common and charitable giving was both                essential to the culture and subject to very limited oversight                        Al Qaeda also sought money from wealthy donors in other Gulf states            Al Qaeda frequently moved the money it raised by hawala an informal and ancient                trustbased system for transferring funds                        In some ways al Qaeda had no choice after its move to Afghanistan in  first                the banking system there was antiquated and undependable and second formal banking                was risky due to the scrutiny that al Qaeda received after the August  East                Africa embassy bombings including UN resolutions against it and the Taliban                        Bin Ladin relied on the established hawala networks operating in Pakistan in Dubai                and throughout the Middle East to transfer funds efficiently Hawaladars associated                with al Qaeda may have used banks to move and store money as did various al Qaeda                fundraisers and operatives outside of Afghanistan but there is little evidence                that Bin Ladin or core al Qaeda members used banks while in Afghanistan                        Before  al Qaeda spent funds as quickly as it received them Actual terrorist                operations represented a relatively small part of al Qaedas estimated  million                annual operating budget Al Qaeda funded salaries for jihadists training camps                airfields vehicles arms and the development of training manuals Bin Ladin                provided approximately  million per year to the Taliban in return for safe                haven Bin Ladin also may have used money to create alliances with other terrorist                organizations although it is unlikely that al Qaeda was funding an overall jihad                program Rather Bin Ladin selectively provided startup funds to new groups or money                for specific terrorist operations                        Al Qaeda has been alleged to have used a variety of illegitimate means particularly                drug trafficking and conflict diamonds to finance itself While the drug trade was                a source of income for the Taliban it did not serve the same purpose for al Qaeda                and there is no reliable evidence that Bin Ladin was involved in or made his money                through drug trafficking                        Similarly we have seen no persuasive evidence that al Qaeda funded itself by trading                in African conflict diamonds  There also have been claims that al Qaeda financed                itself through manipulation of the stock market based on its advance knowledge of                the  attacks Exhaustive investigations by the Securities and Exchange                Commission FBI and other agencies have uncovered no evidence that anyone with                advance knowledge of the attacks profited through securities transactions                        To date the US government has not been able to determine the origin of the money                used for the  attacks Ultimately the question is of little practical                significance Al Qaeda had many avenues of funding If a particular funding source                had dried up al Qaeda could have easily tapped a different source or diverted funds                from another project to fund an operation that cost  over nearly                two years            The Funding of the  Plot            As noted above the  plotters spent somewhere between  and  to                plan and conduct their attack The available evidence indicates that the                 operatives were funded by al Qaeda either through wire transfers or cash provided                by KSM which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts                and accessed from this country Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence                that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial                assistance Similarly we have seen no evidence that any foreign governmentor                foreign government officialsupplied any funding                        We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members Atta Shehhi Jarrah and                Binalshibh received funds from al Qaeda before late  It appears they supported                themselves KSM Binalshibh and another plot facilitator Mustafa al Hawsawi each                received money in some cases perhaps as much as  to perform their roles in                the plot                        After the Hamburg recruits joined the  conspiracy al Qaeda began giving them                money Our knowledge of the funding during this period before the operatives                entered the United States remains murky According to KSM the Hamburg cell members                each received  to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they                had been selected to join the plot and they received additional funds for travel                from Germany to the United States Financial transactions of the plotters are                discussed in more detail in chapter             Requirements for a Successful Attack            As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States al Qaedas                leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to                organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict                catastrophic harm We believe such a list of requirements would have included                             leaders able to evaluate approve and supervise the planning and direction of                    the operation                communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives                    and those who would be helping them                a personnel system that could recruit candidates vet them indoctrinate them                    and give them necessary training                an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of                    enemy strengths and weaknesses                the ability to move people and                the ability to raise and move the necessary money                        The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows                how by the spring and summer of  al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements            By late May  two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the                United States Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive
