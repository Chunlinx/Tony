               what kind of crimes you have in Hattiesburg   uh actually about anything you can imagine uh from you you know this petty theft kind of crud going around vandalism up to  uh certain amount of organized crime where uh gangs are starting to  you know show up and actually you know qualify as gangs   oh boy thats and Hattiesburgs not that big is it fifty thousand or so yeah   uh about fifty yeah right around fifty thousand we i think we this census we just missed fifty thousand by a couple of people or something like that   well   but uh yeah its its right at fifty thousand   yeah  were real disgusted around here in Austin we live in the city and  on December the sixth uh four teenage girls were murdered and mutilated two blocks from our house at a yogurt shop   umhum murdered and mutilated     mutilated uh they cut them up and they  put ice cream inside their bodies and  then they burnt the place down or tried to burn the place down as they left   uh what these are girls who worked at this ice cream parlor or   uh two of them worked there and two of them came to pick them up when they got off their at at eleven oclock that night and   all right so this so this is a place the the place had shut down already   right or just shutting down just closing and  i dont think the police have a clue  uh theyve had the FBI here and  have some sort of analysis of who might have done it what type of person might have done it but   um yeah character profile psychiatric profile   yeah but its just theyre still begging for help and and and i just feel like some of theyre helpless at uh trying to solve this one   yeah yeah ah shoot the the big problem is theres no real punishment for crime anymore i mean the bigger the crime the less likely you are to get punished for it   yeah thats true  my wife and i read a lot of uh  true crime books and you know court cases things like that   i mean get adequately punished anyway yeah yeah   and it boy it just upsets us when people get off with little or nothing theyre theyre on theyre out on probation probation in fifteen years after murdering half a dozen people and   yeah yeah   its just not fair   well they slaughter innocent innocent lots of innocent lives and they get you know a few years and a slap on the wrist and  someone else turns around and you know embezzles a couple of thousand dollars from the local bank and they you know they practically get fried   yes   yeah  i think about a year ago here in Austin they were we were uh the gang problem was getting real bad  and they hired a hundred new policemen  and a lot of them were dedicated just to the crime unit or to the gang unit   yes umhum yeah   and just  recently they announced that theyve pretty much got it under control  there was only one  gang related murder this past year   yeah thats good if nothing else theyve got the gangs pushed down to where theyre  you know not going to be very active at least as far as you know murders or open crimes are concerned   yeah i think one of the things that  they need to do more of which i seen a little bit here in Austin though is getting  actual people in neighborhoods involved   yeah the neighborhood watch type programs  yeah thats one thats the one thing that starting  you know the only two things that are really making a difference   yeah   are when the local people get involved  and when they start doing something positive with families families have gone in the toilet in the last twenty thirty years     yeah uh   and its as though theyre really trying to push to make sure they go down the toilet lot of people lot of institutions  they seem to be fighting against family   seems to be that way i seems like everybody that  weve heard of or know that  go for any kind of psychiatric psychiatric help  uh every problem youve got is blamed on your parents   yeah   and that to me thats just defeating the family right there   yeah well to a certain extent it can be traced back there  and and and thats okay to say so as long as you understand that you got to forgive   i mean if you can yeah   its not like they doing it on purpose usually very seldom are they doing it on purpose   you know you know out of my own family i  i guess  maybe i didnt have everything i wanted when i was growing up but ive as ive gotten older ive learned to  accept the fact that i got what i needed  i was clothed and sheltered and educated and   yeah i had some modicum at least of acceptance and support   i havent blamed any of my future problems on on on the family upbringing or whatever     yeah well thats the way it was with us we had i had a pretty good family life by comparison i had an excellent family life by comparison to a lot of people out there it may not have been perfect but  they did what they knew how to do and they did it the best they knew how so   yeah its just  i like i cant ever imagine my son committing a crime       and i think he knows that you know that thats just something that not in in his world but theres so many people out there that  do commit violent crimes and and small crimes and think nothing of it its   yeah yeah i mean considering the conscious it seems to go  it it it almost invariably does start with the destruction of the family  i mean almost invariably children arent taught respect theyre not taught discipline theyre not taught the need to
