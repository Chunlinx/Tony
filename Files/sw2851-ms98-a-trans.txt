months its occupies quite a bit of my time but   yes   i play in a couple of leagues and and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend but my family usually goes with me we try to do everything we can together   well i think thats uh easy entertainment for a family too   yeah yeah well they uh a good friend of mine that plays on one of my teams we uh thats usually the team i play on with the tournaments and stuff and they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age so they play together pretty well and   under the stands under the bleachers   yeah yeah pretty much and uh Tina enjoys uh the other lady real well so they you know thats kind of nice its like getting together with them so to speak     uhhuh yes well its getting a little hot isnt it it   yeah well its been raining a lot here so far so we havent really had any kind of real heat i think its going to be warm enough this afternoon we were noticing a while ago its already eighty in in the house so it looks like an air conditioner day but   yeah it sure does or maybe this evening anyway   yeah it yeah but you know im sure youre familiar with that living here we go we go through Enid you know quite a bit we go to Tulsa from time to time and my my parents live in southern Illinois so we drive up there and   very much so yeah   well lots lot of times we take seventy five and uh it seems like seems like that goes through Enid i know ive either seen the signs or   no no it doesnt Enid is uh its in the northwest its uh directly across the straight uh state from Tulsa   um i know ive seen the sign somewhere yeah   uh sure you have yes well Enid is not uh an unknown little city it uh   right   an awful lot of people know where it is or have been there and it was uh a very uh selfsufficient uh wealthy uh town for a long time anyway   uhhuh uh uhhuh   you know until uh everything happened the bottom fell out   oh uhhuh   but its beginning to do well but theres a lot of uh old time wealth there that has helped to stabilize things   oh uhhuh uhhuh so uh how long you said youve just lived in North Carolina just like six months then is   since yes something like that oh   and you really like it there huh ive heard so many people talk about that area ive never been there but they sure say its pretty   well its its pretty the weather is wonderful uh this winter we it was just we had so
