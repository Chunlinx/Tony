                    Background        Substance P SP is a peptide neurotransmitter that has        been shown to play a role in nociception smooth muscle        control allergic responses inflammation and glandular        secretion   The amino acid sequence of SP was        determined in    after being isolated from mammalian        gastrointestinal tract in    SP acts as an agonist        at the SP receptor SPR known as the neurokinin        receptor NK in mammalian systems SP activation of the        SPR a Gproteincoupled receptor has a variety of effects        in the nervous system including inhibition of the Mtype K        current I         M    The mechanistic properties of        the SPR have been extensively studied in        receptorexpression systems When transfected into Chinese        hamster ovary CHO cells activation of the SPR results in        an increase in intracellular Ca   accumulation of        inositol phosphates and cAMP formation          The recent development of intense photostable and        pHinsensitive fluorophores along with improvements in        optical detection systems has led to fluorophore labeling        of many pharmacological agents Fluorescent probes can be        used to directly label ligandbinding sites without the use        of radioactivity or antibodies Receptorlabeling with a        fluorophoreconjugated agonist provides advantages over        these conventional methods The production of antibodies to        the receptor protein is not required as the labeled        agonist will bind directly to the receptor Fluorescence        rather than radioactivity can detect the labeled ligand        which provides more information on the localization of the        receptor upon SP activation In addition labeled agonists        can be used in live cells Therefore the use of        fluorescently labeled agents may allow a more extensive        investigation into various receptor functions        Molecular Probes Inc Eugene OR has recently        synthesized five fluorophoreconjugated analogs of SP as        potential tools for direct labeling of the SPR Alexa         BODIPY Fl fluorescein Oregon Green  and        tetramethylrhodamine have been conjugated to the third        amino acid of SP Lys  The amine group of Lys provides a        convenient reactive group for labeling SP without altering        its original amino acid sequence Alexa  BODIPY Fl        fluorescein and Oregon Green  are green fluorophores        while tetramethylrhodamine is a red fluorophore        We have compared the receptor activation and labeling of        five newly synthesized fluorescent analogs of SP Each of        the probes has been tested for  ability to bind to the        receptor  receptor activation in both a heterologous        expression system and in native neurons and  fluorescence        labeling of the receptor This study provides an extensive        characterization of the new SP derivatives that will        provide a basis for future studies involving the        fluorescent conjugates Oregon Green  was found to be        the most useful fluorophore for labeling SP without        altering its biological activity whereas Alexa         drastically altered the binding and activation of SP                    Results                  Spectra properties of fluorescent analogs          The fluorescent properties of a fluorophore can change          when the fluorophore is attached to another molecule in          this case a peptide Furthermore the conditions under          which fluorescence is measured such as pH ionic          strength and buffer composition can affect fluorescence          The absorption and emission spectra of the fluorescent SP          analogs were assessed to determine their fluorescence          under experimental conditions used here As shown in Fig           the peak excitations of Alexa SP BODIPY FlSP          fluoresceinSP Oregon Green SP and          tetramethylrhodamineSP were  nm  nm  nm           nm and  nm respectively The peaks of the emission          curves were  nm  nm  nm  nm and  nm          respectively                          Epifluorescence microscopy          Directlabeling of the SPR with fluorescent ligands          like those analyzed in this study would offer advantages          over current methods of receptor labeling Some of these          advantages include the ability to label live cells and          the ability to conduct receptor labeling without          antibodies or radioactive ligands Therefore an          important characteristic of the fluorescent SP analogs is          their ability to bind to the SPR and to fluoresce under          physiological conditions In order to observe the          directlabeling of the SP conjugates to the SPR CHO          cells expressing the rat SPR rSPR were incubated with          the SP analogs  nM for  hrs at C to prevent          internalization of the receptor rinsed and fixed Under          these conditions all of the labeled forms of SP except          for Alexa SP produced bright membrane staining Fig           Observation of transfected cells incubated with          phosphate buffered saline PBS in the absence of labeled          SP conjugate showed that the transfected cells had some          intracellular autofluorescence Fig  F The          fluorophoretreated cells also show some dull          intracellular fluorescence similar to the          autofluorescence seen in the unstained control cells          The intensity of the staining produced by the green          fluorophores was compared by quantitative analysis The          intensities of the fluorescence after staining with          BODIPY FlSP fluoresceinSP and Oregon Green SP were          significantly greater p   than the intensity          of the fluorescence of cells treated with Alexa SP          TetramethylrhodamineSP also produced intense membrane          staining The intensity of the staining with          tetramethylrhodamineSP could not be directly compared to          the others due to its different excitation and emission          wavelengths          The specificity of the fluorescence staining was          revealed by the finding that unlabeled SP effectively          prevented the fluorescent staining of rSPRtransfected          CHO cells The fluorescence of these cells was similar to          that of transfected cells incubated in PBS alone Fig           F in that they possessed some intracellular          autofluorescence but lacked membrane staining          Application of the labeled analogs to untransfected          CHO cells did not produce membrane staining data not          shown Only intracellular autofluorescence comparable          to that observed with transfected cells incubated with          PBS in the absence of labeled SP Fig  F was seen in          cells lacking the rSPR                          SP receptor binding          An important determinant of the usefulness of the SP          conjugates is their ability to bind to and activate the          SPR Therefore the ability of each of the fluorescent SP          analogs to compete with  I SP binding to the SPR was          assessed using a heterologous expression system          rSPRexpressing CHO cells The results are shown in Fig           The concentration of fluorescent analog required to          inhibit the binding of radiolabeled SP by   IC             was calculated from the binding          studies The rank order of potency for the competing          peptides was unlabeled SP  nM           tetramethylrhodamineSP  nM  Oregon Green SP           nM  BODIPYSP  nM  fluoresceinSP           nM  Alexa SP Alexa SP Fig           A did not compete with  I SP for binding at the          rSPR therefore an IC            value could not be determined          Twoway analysis of variance followed by          StudentNewmanKeuls test showed that there was a          dosedependent effect p   on the binding of          unlabeled SP and the SP analogs to the rSPR Statistical          analysis also demonstrated that the competition binding          curves generated by the SP conjugates were significantly          different than the unlabeled SP binding curve p            Further analysis showed that with the exception          of the binding curves produced by tetramethylrhodamineSP          and Oregon Green SP a significant difference was          seen between the binding curves of the different SP          conjugates p                            Calcium measurements          Activation of the SPR expressed in CHO cells results          in an elevation in intracellular Ca   The          biological activity of the SP conjugates was tested by          examining their ability to elicit Ca elevations          Doseresponse curves for the labeled SP analogs and for          unlabeled SP to produce an increase in intracellular Ca          in CHO cells transfected with the rSPR are shown in          Fig           None of the labeled SP analogs produced Ca          elevations n   when added to untransfected CHO          cells at a concentration of  nM data not shown When          the fluorescent derivatives were added at a concentration          of  nM they produced an increase in the fluorescence          signal due to the inherent fluorescence of the probes          This could also be seen in the absence of cells Due to          this interference the activity of the fluorescent probes          to produce Ca elevations could not be tested at          concentrations higher than  nM          Alexa SP produced the most prominent increase in          nonspecific fluorescence in the absence of cells When           nM or  nM Alexa SP was added the fluorophore          produced signals similar in intensity to those observed          when this analog was added to transfected or          untransfected CHO cells data not shown To determine if          Alexa SP could specifically produce a          receptormediated Ca response the average of the          fluorescence signal produced by Alexa SP in the          absence of cells was subtracted from the fluorescent          signal obtained when Alexa SP was added to          SPRexpressing CHO cells The results showed that Alexa          SP did not activate the SPR to produce a Ca          response However the other four SP analogs were able          to elicit Ca responses in rSPRexpressing CHO          cells          Statistical analysis twoway analysis of variance          followed by StudentNewmanKeuls test demonstrated that          unlabeled SP and the SP analogs except Alexa SP          elicited dosedependent Ca elevations p            Analysis also showed that there was not a significant          difference p   in Ca elevations generated by          unlabeled SP or the various SP conjugates with the          exception of Alexa SP which did not elicit a calcium          response                          Effects of SP analogs on single neurons          The data thus far show that the labeled forms of SP          with the exception of Alexa SP can bind to and          activate the receptor in a heterologous expression          system It is also of importance to determine the          activity of the labeled ligands in a cell that          endogenously expresses the SPR The principal neurons of          bullfrog sympathetic ganglia express a SPR that has been          well characterized with regard to its structure and          function The bullfrog sympathetic ganglia SPR bfSPR          has  homology to the rSPR at the amino acid level          Perhaps most importantly nine of the ten residues that          have been demonstrated to be important for SP binding to          mammalian receptors are conserved in the bullfrog          receptor The effects of SP and other tachykinins at the          bfSPR have been previously well characterized              The primary biological response following activation of          the ganglionic SPR is inhibition of the Mtype K          current I           M           SP produces a dosedependent inhibition of I           M   The responses of a given          neuron to a given form of labeled SP have been compared          to the responses of those same neurons to unlabeled SP at          a concentration of  nM Fig  At this concentration          SP typically elicits a   depression of I           M  BODIPY FlSP and Oregon Green          SP produced an inhibition of I           M similar to that of unlabeled SP          FluoresceinSP was variable in its ability to inhibit the          current being effective on only two of the four cells          tested At a concentration of  nM neither Alexa          SP nor tetramethylrhodamineSP inhibited I           M  thus they were further tested at a          concentration of  M At this concentration          tetramethylrhodamineSP inhibited I           M by     n   however Alexa          SP did not inhibit I           M  Doseresponse curves for the          analogs that inhibited I           M and for unlabeled SP are shown in          the plots in Fig  A dosedependency was observed for          the effects of BODIPY FlSP fluoresceinSP and Oregon          Green SP                            Discussion        A number of previous studies have demonstrated that        fluorescently labeled ligands are useful probes for        studying ligandreceptor interactions            Improved fluorophores better optics and the increased        sensitivity of detection systems have led to an increased        usage of fluorescently labeled ligands It is of vital        importance that additions of fluorescent groups do not        alter the normal functioning of the ligand for example by        changing the binding affinity or by altering the receptor        activation properties of the ligand If the fluorescent        group does alter the properties of the ligand it is        important that these alterations be understood so that the        results obtained with the labeled ligand can be correctly        interpreted In this study we have examined the        fundamental consequences of labeling the neuropeptide SP        with five different fluorescent probes by comparing the        effects of the labeled compounds with those of the parent        compound SP        All five of the fluorescent probes were modified at the        Lys position with aromatic groups Alexa  and        tetramethylrhodamine add negative and positive charges        respectively to SP The remaining fluorophores BODIPY Fl        fluorescein and Oregon Green  do not alter the charge        With regard to size BODIPY Fl is the smallest of the        fluorophores added whereas Alexa  and        tetramethylrhodamine are the largest of the        fluorophores        The most significant alteration of the activity of SP        was produced when Alexa  was added to SP The        experiments repeatedly showed that Alexa SP does not        posses the same characteristics as unlabeled SP Alexa        SP did not compete with  I SP in the competition        binding assay Consistent with the binding data this SP        analog did not stain rSPRtransfected CHO cells        Furthermore Alexa SP did not exhibit functional        activity in two different assays It failed to elicit a Ca        response in rSPRexpressing CHO cells and failed to        produce I         M inhibition at the bfSPR both of which        are characteristic effects mediated by SP        Like Alexa  tetramethylrhodamine also adds a charge        to SP but tetramethylrhodamineSP generated an IC          that was the most similar to that of        unlabeled SP This SP analog also produced intense staining        and typical Ca responses at the rSPR However        tetramethylrhodamineSP was ineffective at inhibiting I         M at a  nM concentration but did so        upon increasing the concentration to  M Therefore        tetramethylrhodamineSP is capable of binding to the SPR        and activating Ca responses but has a decreased potency        for inhibiting I         M         Lys of SP has been shown to interact with the NH          terminal extracellular tail residues         of the mouse SPR   Though residues  of the        mouse SPR are primarily conserved in the rSPR only  of        the  residues are conserved in the bullfrog SPR Given        the importance of Lys in the mouse SPR it is therefore        conceivable that an alteration in the charge of the parent        compound SP as is the case with Alexa SP and        tetramethylrhodamineSP may cause a change in the typical        actions of SP The addition of Alexa  causes a greater        change in the charge of SP which might inhibit proper        ligandreceptor interaction and thus hinder binding of the        SP analog to the SPR Tetramethylrhodamine also alters the        charge of SP but unlike Alexa  the fluorophore is        positively charged Perhaps the addition a single positive        charge to SP by tetramethylrhodamine does not disrupt        proper ligandreceptor interactions as drastically as the        multiple negative charges that Alexa  adds to SP        Therefore the less drastic charge alteration made by        tetramethylrhodamine may allow the mechanistic        characteristics of SP to be preserved albeit with a        decreased potency to inhibit I         M         Although the structure of fluorescein is very similar to        that of Oregon Green   difluorofluorescein        fluoresceinSP did not behave in the same manner as Oregon        Green SP or unlabeled SP Of the conjugates that        competed with  I SP fluoresceinSP had the lowest        binding affinity as compared to unlabeled SP The analog        was also variable in its ability to inhibit I         M at the bfSPR However it consistently        produced Ca elevations and membrane staining at the rSPR        expressed in CHO cells        BODIPY FlSP and Oregon Green SP produced inhibition        of I         M and Ca elevations similar to that        produced by unlabeled SP Thus labeling with either of        these two fluorophores did not alter the functional        activity of SP at the SPR in either a heterologous        expression system or native cells These SP analogs also        brightly stained the membranes of rSPR transfected CHO        cells The IC          values of BODIPY FlSP and Oregon        Green SP in competition binding studies were greater        than that of unlabeled SP When compared to unlabeled SP        Oregon Green SP and BODIPY FLSP had a twofold and        tenfold increase in binding affinity respectively        Interestingly neither BODIPY Fl nor Oregon Green  is        charged        It is interesting to note that although there was a        significant difference between the binding curves of the        fluorescent derivatives of SP and unlabeled SP there was        not a statistically significant in the peptides ability to        produce dosedependent Ca elevations These might be        explained by the differences in the mechanisms that        underlie the measurements made in the different        experiments The binding experiments measure the actions of        the peptides at the receptor Ca fluxes indicate        additional mechanisms downstream of the receptor including        second messenger activation The data may reflect the fact        that receptor binding and signal activation are not        strictly correlated in Gprotein coupled systems        The evidence presented here suggests that four of the        analogs BODIPY FlSP fluoresceinSP Oregon Green SP        and tetramethylrhodamineSP are acting specifically at the        SPR Binding analysis showed that the above conjugates        compete with  I SP at the rSPR These four analogs        only produced Ca responses in cells transfected with the        SPR they had no effect in nontransfected cells        Similarly membrane staining was observed in transfected        CHO cells but not in untransfected cells        Molecular Probes introduced and investigated seven Alexa        dyes including Alexa  and reported that the dyes were        more fluorescent and more photostable than their        counterparts   In their study Alexa  was compared        to fluorescein The investigators conjugated the Alexa        fluorophores and other similar compounds such as        fluorescein to different proteins to compare brightness        and stability They showed that Alexa  was brighter and        more stable than fluorescein when conjugated to biotin        binding proteins goat antimouse IgG and its Fab        fragments However they did not test for alterations in        binding affinities or biological activity after the        addition of the fluorophores        Another study has examined the effects of fluorescent        conjugation on opioid peptide activity   Alexa  and        BODIPY TR were used to label dermorphin deltrophin TIPP        TryTicPhePhe and endomorphin by adding a cysteine to        each peptide at the Cterminus followed by conjugation of        the fluorophores to the cysteine residue The investigators        found that the dermorphin and deltorphin analogs had an        increased binding affinity for the  and opioid        receptors respectively and that the biological activities        of parent compounds were preserved However when Alexa         was conjugated to TIPP and endomorphin the binding        affinities of the parent compounds were decreased        Buku et al   synthesized two fluorescent probes for        the vasotocin receptor using fluorescein and        tetramethylrhodamine These investigators had previously        conjugated the fluorophores to the seventh position of        vasotocin a nonapeptide and found that it had biological        activity but that the biological activity was reduced when        compared to the native compound   Therefore the        investigators conjugated the fluorophores to the ninth        position and found that the analog was fold more potent        than the analog with the fluorophores at the seventh        position Thus they concluded that by moving the bulky        fluorophore to the end of vasotocin and not altering an        amino acid involved in binding and activation of the        vasotocin receptor minimized the reduction in biological        activity of the probes        In summary our results along with those from other labs        show that in some cases conjugation of a specific        fluorescent label can be added to a peptide without        altering the activity of the parent compound In other        cases however the activity of the original compound may        be drastically altered Therefore the biological activity        of each novel fluorophore conjugate must be analyzed        Analysis of labeled compounds should include assessment of        binding and biological activity as well as brightness and        stability                    Conclusions        The results of our study show that there are dramatic        differences in the function of SP labeled at the Lys        position with different fluorophores Alexa  which was        the largest and added the most charged groups to SP was        unable to label the SPR and altered the biological activity        of SP in live and cultured cells Oregon Green  and        BODIPY Fl which are smaller and uncharged appear to be        the most useful fluorophores for labeling SP without        altering the normal functions of SP at the SPR regardless        of the expression system These results suggest that Oregon        Green SP and BODIPY FlSP would be the most useful        fluorescent ligands for future studies of the SPR                    Materials and Methods                  Labeled peptides          SP labeled with Alexa  S BODIPY Fl          S fluorescein S Oregon Green

TRITC          tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate filter set          excitation  nm dichroic LP emission           nm Pictures were taken with a SPOT camera Diagnostic          Instruments Inc Sterling Heights MI All digital          images of the green fluorophores were taken at a constant          gain  and exposure time  s to allow for direct          comparison between cells and experiments Pictures of          tetramethylrhodamineSP the red fluorophore were taken          at a gain of  and a  s exposure time          The specificity of the fluorescent staining to the          rSPR was analyzed in two ways First incubating          untransfected CHO cells with  nM of each analog          assessed nonspecific staining Secondly staining of          rSPRtransfected CHO cells was performed in the presence          of an excess of unlabeled SP Transfected cells were          pretreated with  M unlabeled SP for  hr at C Then          the cells were rinsed and incubated with  M unlabeled          SP and  nM labeled SP for  hr at C The cells were          rinsed fixed and viewed as described above                          Image Analysis          Epifluorescence images from the wells containing only          conjugated SP  nM were analyzed using Scion Image          Scion Corporation Frederick MD For each fluorophore          except tetramethylrhodamine a line was drawn around the          outside of the cell membrane of  cells           cellsexperiment to create a boundary the area and          pixel intensity were then measured within each boundary          Background as determined by measuring the intensity and          area of  control cells incubated with PBS in the          absence of a fluorophore was subtracted Cell area was          used to normalize between cells thus the ratio of          intensity to area was calculated for the treated and          untreated cells                          Receptor binding          Radioligand competition binding assays utilizing CHO          cells stably expressing the rSPR were performed with          BoltonHunter  I SP NEN Boston MA at a          concentration of  pM FluoresceinSP Alexa SP          BODIPY FlSP fluoresceinSP Oregon Green SP or          tetramethylrhodamineSP was added at increasing          concentrations from  pM to  M to compete with the           I SP In order to reach equilibrium          rSPRexpressing CHO cells  cellswell were          incubated in a prewetted Millipore Multiscreen  well          BV filtration plate France with both radiolabeled and          fluorescently labeled SP at C for  hrs Peptides and          cells were prepared in Tris Buffered Saline Binding          Buffer  mM Tris  mM NaCl  mgml bacitracin           gml leupeptin  gml chymostatin   bovine serum          albumin pH  Following incubation cells were          filtered and washed using a Millipore vacuum manifold          France Filters were punched and analyzed using a          Packard Cobra II series autogamma counter Meriden CT          to determine counts per minute cpm          Nonspecific binding was specified as the counts          obtained with  M unlabeled SP in the presence of          radiolabeled SP Statistical analysis showed that there          was not a significant difference between the fluorescent          conjugates and unlabeled SP when  M of SP or its          derivatives was present with  pM  I SP In each          experiment specific binding was determined by          subtracting nonspecific binding from the original cpm          measurements The data were normalized by calculating BB                    o for each fluorophore where B is the          cpm of  I SP specifically bound in the presence of          nonradioactive SP and B           o is the cpm of  I SP          specifically bound in the presence of  pM          fluorescently labeled SP The data were plotted as a          function of competitor concentration vs BB           o  Sigmoidal Hill  parameter          regression was then performed on the data to determine          the IC             the concentration of fluorescent          analog required to inhibit the binding of radiolabeled SP          by   for each SP analog                          Calcium measurements          Doseresponse curves for the ability of the SP analogs          to produce Ca elevations upon binding to the SPR were          obtained as previously described   Briefly          transfected CHO cells expressing the rSPR were cultured          onto coverslips until   confluent The coverslips          were incubated in a Ca free solution containing          furaPE AM and pluronic acid Texas Fluorescence Labs          Austin TX for  min washed then incubated in a Ca          containing solution for  min A CAF          Intracellular Ion Analyzer Jasco Corp Tokyo Japan          was used to measure the fura PE fluorescence emission          Cytosolic Ca concentrations were measured by taking the          ratio of fluorescence emission at  nm by excitation at           and  nm Doseresponse curves were obtained by          measuring the Ca responses produced by adding various          concentrations  pM  nM  nM and  nM of the          labeled probes Ionomycin Sigma St Louis MO was          added at a concentration of  M at the end of each          experiment to obtain the maximal Ca elevation for that          coverslip Ca responses were measured by subtracting          the peak of each response from the baseline Responses          are expressed as a fraction of the ionomycin maximum          response          Two experiments were carried out to serve as negative          controls In the first control experiment untransfected          CHO cells were utilized to determine if any of the SP          conjugates were eliciting Ca responses through a          pathway independent of rSPR activation Each of the SP          isoforms was added to untransfected CHO cells at a          concentration of  nM and the signals if any were          recorded If a SP conjugate caused an increase in Ca at           nM then  and  nM concentrations for that          fluorophore were also tested          The second control experiment measured fluorescence          produced by the SP analogs themselves in the absence of          cells Each of the SP fluorophores was added to the Ca          solution in the absence of cells at a concentration of           nM and increases in fluorescence if any were          recorded If a response was observed at a  nM          concentration then  and  nM concentrations were also          tested for that SP analog If a SP analog produced a Ca          elevation in either control assay then the average n          of  for the differences between the baseline and peak          Ca signals for that concentration was calculated The          average was then subtracted from the Ca responses          observed when that SP analog was added to transfected and          untransfected CHO cells at that concentration                          Electrophysiology          Single neurons were dissociated from bullfrog          sympathetic ganglia as described previously            Briefly ganglia were dissected treated with enzymes and          then stored in growth medium at C for  to  days The          ganglia were triturated to release single neurons for          daily use          Whole cell recordings of isolated neurons were          conducted at room temperature  C Drugs were applied          by single cell superfusion   and the bath constantly          perfused separately with extracellular solution Whole          cell recordings were made with electrodes with          resistances of  M when filled with intracellular          solution          The compositions of solutions for electrophysiology          are shown in mM unless otherwise noted Intracellular or

every  s The          recordings were filtered at  kHz and stored on magnetic          tape The I           M relaxations were sampled on line at           kHz I           M was measured as the amplitude of the          current tail following a voltage step from  mV to           mV   To quantify the inhibition of I           M  the current before drug and at the          maximum inhibition during each response were measured and          the percentage of inhibition of I           M was calculated                          Statistical Analysis          The percent of ionomycin data from the Ca elevation          experiments and the BB            data from the binding experiments          were both subjected to twoway ANOVA analysis with the          independent variables being fluorescent conjugate and          dose Oneway ANOVA analysis was used to describe the          intensity to area measurements from the fluorescent          images except tetramethylrhodamine These data like the          data obtained from the binding assay and Ca analysis          were analyzed for variance followed by the          StudentNewmanKeuls test
