                                 Weld vs Helms            Bill Weld the formerRepublican governor of Massachusetts wants the Senate to consider hisnomination to be US ambassador to Mexico Jesse Helms the Republicanchairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee wants to stop him Lastweek Weld quit his job to go to Washington to lobby for his cause Throughsurrogates interviews and press conferences the two men are waging a war ofwords This war isnt bound by strict rules of logic but its moreintellectual than an armtwisting match Its a contest of conceptualizationand persuasion Whichever player successfully frames the questions at stakewill capture public opinion and political support and thereby win So far thewar has been waged on four fronts                                          Drugs vs social policy Helms has stuck doggedly to a single issuedrugs He points out that Weld favors legalizing marijuana for medicalpurposes which conservatives place on the slippery slope toward completelegalization favors providing addicts with clean needles to prevent thespread of AIDS and that he prosecuted few drug cases as a US attorney Inshort says Helms Weld is soft on drugsthe last thing we need in anambassador to Mexico            Weld could reply that he had opposed Californiasmedicalmarijuana initiative because it was too lax or that Helms is a pusherfor tobacco or that it might be a good idea to stop treating Mexicos drugproblem as a war But Weld hasnt touched the drug question How come Onerule of the frame game is to avoid issues on which youre guaranteed to loseThis isnt an Ivy League debating society where you can win by ingeniouslydefending a difficult position In politics youre in deep trouble as soon asyou question the war on drugs This is particularly true if youre fighting fora job in the Clinton administration where insecurity over the drug war runshigh Just ask Joycelyn Elders            Ratherthan answer Helms charge Weld shifted and broadened the conflict On July he called a press conference to declare Sen Helms opposition has nothingwhatsoever to do with drug policy It has everything to do with the future ofthe Republican Party In plain language I am not Sen Helms kind ofRepublican I do not pass his litmus test on social policy Nor do I want toOvernight the WeldHelms standoff became a media sensation This wasnt justabout drugs reporters concluded It was about Helms distaste for Weldsmoderate views on social issues such as abortion With that the advantageswung to Weld While Helms has the more popular position on drugs Weld has themore popular position on abortion            Helms spokesman Marc Thiessen resisted thismaneuver He insisted Helms concern was drugs not ideology The evidencebacks Thiessen up Helms supported prochoice Republican Bill Cohen of Mainefor secretary of defense and has offered to confirm Weld as ambassador to acountry without a major marijuana problem such as India But in the framegame such petty facts are easily overwhelmed by larger themes Welds spinprevails for several reasons            To begin with Weldsargument fits nicely into the context of recent Republican infighting Havingcome apart over foreign policy trade with China and fiscal policy the Houseleadership coup the Republicans seem ripe for a civil war over social policyFurthermore the Washington press corps never tires of writing about Republicantroubles on abortion and gay rightsthough Helms hasnt mentioned either issuein connection with Weld since the confirmation fight began            Aboveall the press loves to personalize debates Drug policy is boring but a fightbetween a saucy blue blood and a surly redneck is fun Helms wasnt even thefirst member of Congress to oppose Welds nomination Others who oppose Weldhave pleaded that Helms isnt the point Its a futile argument Helms and hisfamous wedge issues are just too colorful             Ideology vs competence Congressional Republicanswho support Welds nomination dont want their party torn asunder in theprocess Their solution is to separate the question of Welds ideology from hiscompetence They point out that he speaks Spanish knows Mexico and is smartand accomplished This is not about the heart and soul of the RepublicanParty argued Rep Chris Shays RConn in a TV debate July  Its aboutwhether this nominee is competent to serve in Mexico            Helmssupporters accept this distinction because it subverts Welds campaign tobroaden the ideological confrontation They argue that Welds indifferencetoward the war on drugs has affected his competence as a law enforcer and willdo so again if he becomes ambassador to Mexico            Weld however maintains the fight isabout the partys soul even as Republican moderates protest it isnt TheHelmsShays argument for a distinction between ideology and competence isanalytically more sophisticated but viscerally less compelling Which means itwill probably prevail in a confirmation hearing but lose in the court of publicopinion vanquished by Welds campaign for libertarian martyrdom In the framegame nuance is almost always a loser Remember the last guy to argue for adistinction between ideology and competence was Michael Dukakis            Perversely Weld lost the ideologycompetence battle by winning thedrugsmorality battle Not only did he attack Helms July  but hedeliberately embarrassed the White Housewhich had refrained from quarrelingwith Helmsby calling on Clinton to speak up for his confirmation Weldscaustic apostasy handed his enemies a persuasive argument against his fitnessfor the jobthat hes undiplomatic             Who started the fight Every kid knows that when aparent catches you fighting with another kid the first thing to do is accusethe other kid of starting it Weld should have been able to play the victimsince Helms arguably started the fight by announcing in June that he would denyWeld a hearing But Weld blew this moral advantage by attacking Helms July It wasnt the first punch thrown but it was the first one most people sawThis allowed Helms spokesman to cast his boss as the victim Senate MajorityLeader Trent Lott RMiss latched on to this as an excuse to side with HelmsWeld hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with politicalrhetoric that was just uncalled for Lott complained            Belatedly Weld is trying toregain the moral high ground On July  he pleaded Before I had ever metHelms before the man really knew anything about me he said I was unfit tobe ambassador had loose lips and was soft on drugs And I said Where doesJesse Helms get off saying all these mean things about me And people inWashington threw up their hands in alarm and said My goodness he attackedthe chairman  Weld also has claimed to be a victim of Helms ideologicalextortion            Theideological extortion argument is particularly ingenious Typicallyextortion means that youre threatening someone with harm or embarrassment toextract a concession Helms has no illusions that he can make Weld concedeanything His vow to kill Welds nomination is a promise not a threat ItsWeld whos trying to scare Republicans into supporting him by threatening toturn his fight with Helms into an ideological civil war His charge ofideological extortion is part of his ideological extortion And itssucceeding On Aug  Sen Dick Lugar RInd rescued Weld by demanding thathe get a hearing lest his jihad against Helms ignite civil war in theRepublican Party             Substance vs process Having lost theadvantage on fronts  and  Weld has opened a fourth more promising frontrecently He has stopped debating the substance of his quarrel with Helms andhas focused instead on his right to a hearing At a July  press conferenceWeld repeated his favorite question six times Im going to be asking that oneinsistent question Why should there not be a hearing Why should one man in ademocracy block the conduct of the peoples business            This new message helps Weldin the Senate because it allows Republicans to defend him without exacerbatingthe partys internal conflicts It certainly emboldened Lugar A Senatechairman cannot be dictatorial ultimately when a majority of the committee amajority of the Senate a majority of the American people want action Lugarsaid of Helms Aug             Likewisethe procedural argument allows the White House to challenge Helms obstinacywithout appearing to foment the GOPs identity crisis Clinton spokesman MikeMcCurry who had refused July  to comment on matters in the other partywas so moved by Welds new plea for a fair hearing that he repeated thatphrase six times at his July  press briefing            But the true beauty of the give him a hearing argument isthat it capitalizes on antiWashington populism In his July  pressconference Weld decried the Washington rules that allow a single senator tothwart the peoples will by refusing to schedule a hearing Framed this wayWelds apostasy becomes a virtue instead of a vice suggesting candor insteadof a lack of diplomacy            Which player will win thegame Helms allies say the nomination is doomed They think Weld overlookedthe games cardinal rule that Congress has its own rules including theabsolute power of committee chairmen over supplicants such as Weld Why hesnot even a governor anymore they scoff Hes just a lowly citizen But maybetheyre the ones who have misjudged the game Maybe the era of Ross Perotsatellite feeds and blastfaxes has ended the invisibility and the certaintyof the congressional backroom kill Maybe every political fight is a framegame now Even if Citizen Weld cant reach Mexico he can still reach AmericaAnd maybe thats been his game all along
