          yeah i have what uh about yourself   well uh a few i guess uh i was trying to think  as i was asking you just exactly what movies i had seen recently i i took my wife to see one uh oh my goodness i cant you tell me first because i cant think right now   yeah i i should because ive been waiting for a few minutes to talk uh interesting interestingly enough i had the same topic yesterday when i called so ive got my spiel down   you mean you had the same topic twice um   uhhuh twice in a row second time its happened to me but uh   hum   lets see last week my wife and i went to see uh Kindergarten Cop   oh now that was great we saw that too   yeah that was it was it was pretty cool   its the first time ive seen him do a uh a comedy almost type show   yeah   which is kind of a a change for Arnold Schwarzenegger   right   yeah now that was a good show my my wife and i enjoyed that a lot i think the kids did too we didnt go together though   oh they went another time though   yeah they well i got one runs around i got two boys and one boy runs around with one his group of friends and the other boy runs around with his group of friends i think both of them separately saw it at two different times even with their group of friends   wow   and then mom and dad went to see it when it went to the dollar and a half movie house   yeah well fortunately we have a dollar movie here so i   they used to be a dollar here but it finally went up   oh i hope doesnt i think theyre hedging to but uh i dont want them anyway it was worth uh two bucks for my wife and i to go   yeah oh yeah it was good show really was uh we went to see uh The King i think its The King Mary Jo and i did   so okay   thats the one that uh oh i forget the guys name that stars with Roseanne on TV oh whats that yeah Goodman and uh that was funny now that was really a good show   Goodman okay   i mean it wasnt a great show its just a B movie but it was fun i think uh i think uh you and your wife would enjoy that its pretty light hearted humor and and and it was uh it was kind of neat kind of cute   yeah couple of dollars worth of laughs   oh it was definitely worth that it it was worth couple of bucks just to get out and watch that and it was upbeat movie and everything else and uh you know uh eat the popcorn and all that   yeah   thats where they make the money is on the popcorn anyway they charge ridiculous prices they charge more for the popcorn than they do for the movie   right   yeah       The King huh okay   yeah i think its called The King or something like that its its uh John Goodman i think its you know and hes the main star in the whole movie   okay   and its got a  a couple pretty good uh supporting actors   all right   and uh its funny it it really is uh you know we uh rather enjoyed trying to think of a couple of others that we went to see that we went to see one movie i cant remember the name of it now though but it was uh oh what was it i cant remember its just terrible anyway i i long time back uh uh for the benefit at least of the subject were discussing i went to see Die Hard Two i guess it was Die Die Harder   yeah yeah   and that was a scream and you know i thought that was pretty good and um   yeah   uh i dont know i cant think of another one other than that at the moment how about you   well uh my wife has a problem with uh she cant suspend her disbelief of a movie like shell sit there and say that wont happen that cant happen theres no way you know so its kind of hard for me to pick like a uh       like if we would go see a Von Dame movie and he runs around the screen for an hour and half just kicking teeth you know   uhhuh umhum umhum   he shed be like no he he couldnt do that you cant beat up ten guys at once with guns and     so she cant really enjoy it   yeah so she cant even enjoy it but i think were working on her a little bit where she just sits back and takes the movie at what it is     uhhuh   so weve been working uh a couple of friends of myself   uhhuh   uh weve been you know well go to like uh Segal or we havent went to Segal yet were going to and Van Damme and like uh Stallone   uhhuh yeah   like like the First Blood   Stallone just did a comedy incidentally that uh i thinks out now   yeah thats what the guy told me last night hes like a gangster or something   yeah yeah   so id like to see that   yeah im kind of looking forward that my wife says theres one she wants me to take her to see this weekend and uh im trying its about a it it its one that was done a long time ago i think Tony Curtis uh uh uh was uh the star in where the guy dies falls overboard or something and comes back as a woman   huh   and uh theres uh uh a movie coming out uh gosh whats the name of that its already out matter of fact its been advertised on TV um about a guy that falls over he he gets killed somehow or another and he comes back as a woman and you talk about funny at least the little snapshot previews that theyve shown on TV advertising it are hilarious i mean it is really funny and uh so were going to go see that   yeah   now we saw a movie called Sisters whats uh that may have been almost a year ago now i think about it that was quite good i dont know if youve   did that have that girl from Cheers in it   uh lets see i dont remember whether Cheers no i dont think so you mean Christie   okay yeah   no i dont think she was in this one i kind was trying to remember exactly who the characters were but uh it was a real touching show about three sisters   oh okay this was a comedy so it probably wouldnt be the same one   no no this this was a real uh uh sort of serious piece it had some light moments but basically it was a serious piece i thought it was just called Sisters or something like that or the The Sisters or The Three Sisters or something um uh i cant really quite remember and then we saw one uh some time back its a shame i cant remember the titles of these for the benefit of this conversation although it may not be that the uh necessarily the uh intent but nevertheless that that we saw one here a while back that Dolly Parton and several ladies starred in three or four or five uh three or four women together   with old Shirley MacLaine oh yeah i i dont know the name of it either   yeah yeah and yeah that was pretty good it was okay uh you know most of t his stuff is B movies anyway   have you seen Awakenings with Robin Williams   no i havent   i would suggest that its   have you seen that   yes i have   was it really good i i have heard all kinds of mixed things about it   well im uh leaning toward medical professions myself so it had some uh   are you   you know  he was a doctor and it was in a clinical uh   psychologist something right umhum   yeah psychiatric uh clinical setting so it was interesting to to say the least from that standpoint because it is a true story   uhhuh   and   oh yeah thats right i think it was a take off from true story youre right   yeah so uh   yeah who was the guy he rehabilitated he starred in Taxi or not Taxi uh yeah oh yeah it was Robert DeNiro right   was it DeNiro yeah that he just did an incredible job of acting   did he well did you ever see speaking of uh of uh medical oriented movie or at least a movie about somebody got rehabilitated did you ever see the one uh that Dustin Hoffman starred in   Rain Man   yeah now wasnt that a good show   yeah now that see if you liked that you would   i really enjoyed it oh man i enjoyed that show   okay if you liked that um youd probably   my wife and i both enjoyed that   yeah you would enjoy Awakenings Awakenings is as touching   uhhuh huh   but it doesnt have the the language and other things that might detract from the movie   uhhuh uhhuh   its its really its a movie that wouldnt mind taking my kids to   oh i see thats good   and i mean its really clean and but its it doesnt lose any quality i mean   uhhuh   i think sometimes movies try to spice it up a little bit with things unnecessary uh language or nudity or whatever   yeah yeah yeah   but this one here is Awakenings is very clean that was the only thing i didnt like about uh   uhhuh rain man   it sure it makes it true to life and everything but uh you know about Rain Man it was language is harsh every now and then   yeah yeah   but yeah it was cool id probably seen it three or four times   right yeah that that was uh one that we really enjoyed i was trying to think of uh oh what was that one though it slips me now unfortunately i should have done  thinking about this   well its  you called on the spur of the moment you dont really know   yeah yeah um oh uh how about any older shows like John Wayne movies and things like you got any favorites along those lines   oh yeah uh i like most of the old John Wayne westerns uh like El Dorado is that one and uh   yeah me too oh yeah yeah i like almost everything he yeah i really love rue Grit   yeah True Grit Rooster Cogburn   and uh yeah oh man they i thought they were really really fun they were interesting and the one he did with his boys uh Jake Big Jake     yeah   ive seen that on TV several times and that was a lot of fun movie you know i have kind of favorite because i like the uh the musical scores to it matter of fact i had to hunt for years to finally find a copy of the record uh because they made so few of them it wasnt really wasnt all that popular and that was uh uh not was it Hogans Heroes or   yeah that TV show or   Kellys Heroes Kelly Heroes name of the show the one that Clint Eastwood stars in and uh and Carroll OConnor   Kellys Heroes yeah yeah uhhuh   now thats one of my favorite shows i really enjoy ive been trying to tape that one for years and havent succeeded in doing so yet   really   but i finally did find an album i had to look around several different dealers here in the uh uh Maryland area and put the word out to find the album that had the uh movie score on it that you know they open the show with uh uh a movie score with a score to that and then they wind up at the end playing a tune that is just one of my favorites ive loved it for years and im sitting here as i tell you this trying to think of the name of it but uh  its sung by the Herb Alpert congregation uh the uh the uh  the opening and the closing score of Kelly Heroes the   do you remember much about that movie   the Kellys Heroes the movie   yeah   yeah i i remember that uh uh their on there way into Germany they make up their own little army you might say they start out small but they get bigger and bigger all the time they bribe this guy well little bribe hes willing to go in on it theyve got three tanks that have these huge pipes he puts on the turrets to make   uhhuh
