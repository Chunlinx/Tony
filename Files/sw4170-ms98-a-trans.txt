        all right uh i think we pay a little bit too much in taxes and we dont always get what we pay for     i agree im particularly worried about Social Security since im at the end of the baby boomer generation and theres not gonna be any money left when i get through so i kind of feel like im supporting a lot of people and that its just gonna go into a hole  i dont think that im gonna get anything out of it when the time comes from   yeah no   it other than that yeah   yeah i i kind of feel the same way you know you pay all this money into Social Security and then youre not gonna get anything back out of it you know   yeah   because youre paying for everybody that uses it now and its not gonna be there when you need it   right everybody theres not gonna be enough people to support us when we get our age  up that way but   yep   well be supporting were theyre were a lot of people right now supporting a few people and then when the time comes and its a few people supporting a lot of people its not gonna even out very fairly   yeah umhum   that way i dont have to i dont worry about the other i dont have state taxes really because im from Texas so im happy with that  im worried about it though because every year they sit there and try to put more taxes in you know     yeah   and theyre trying to get property tax in our county  but   yeah well well  well well i think some of the taxes that pay you know youre paying more for the people to to disburse the money out than you are for uh the money to be spent you know like on education and stuff   yeah theres so much administration and nothing  when it when it comes right down to it the overhead is it get everything gets eaten up in overhead and doesnt actually  do do much   yeah so i i feel like some of like i said some most of the taxes that we pay are not being used for what theyre supposed to be used for   yeah i was thinking the other day you know it was like no taxation without representation and so long ago and now were just eaten alive by       all this government that cant pay for itself and goes into debt more and more and more and more and we dont have much say about it     yeah   and the government doesnt seem to do a  be doing a whole lot of things i like either   uh  yeah and and they like they use taxes to to make grants to people that   theyre going   you know they wanna find out how come butterflies do fly and all other kinds and i think thats kind of stupid   yeah and then this National Endowment for the Arts thing where they they put pornography up in the in the name of art you know   umhum   and make me pay for it   yeah   my you know i i dont exactly appreciate that either i really get frustrated when government starts to do things that are immoral and then expect me to support them on it   yeah and   first you get to the point where its like you feel like protesting by not paying just to make  them understand that they cant do this just because you know its our money theyre using   yep   for it they cant just think well its ours now we got it we can do what we want with it   uh   it says that im standing it it says i approve if i sit there and pay it and i get kind of upset about that   yeah i can understand that because and uh its it you know like you said it makes you upset and it makes me upset too when i hear stuff like that and i just heard on the news tonight where they all them people in Congress overdrafted themselves and they you know finally gonna come out with everybodys name now saying who done it   well thats good     so   yeah you start to feel real powerless   yep   but on the other hand at least were  were powerless in a lot of ways but then theres so many other countries that im glad im not in     oh yeah   you know it seems to me like the minute you starting putting in any radical changes in anything you end up with something like um Liberia or  uh Czechoslovakia you know i mean it seems like id rather try to work from inside the system to change something than to throw away what weve got now   oh yeah   it would be pretty frightening the other way around its kind of scary now seeing the way   uh   theyre going over there   oh yeah uh that and you know like a lot of our tax money goes to helping other countries and stuff and i think we ought to use a lot of that money here in the states before we send it to someplace else
