toxicity tests for use inthe National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System NPDES PermitsProgram to identify effluents and receiving waters containing toxicmaterials in chronically toxic concentrations The methods includedin this manual are referenced in Table IA  CFR Part regulations and therefore constitute approved methods for chronictoxicity tests They are also suitable for determining the toxicityof specific compounds contained in discharges The tests may beconducted in a central laboratory or onsite by the regulatoryagency or the permitteeThe data are used for NPDES permits development and todetermine compliance with permit toxicity limits Data can also beused to predict potential acute and chronic toxicity in thereceiving water based on the LC NOEC IC or IC see Section Chronic Toxicity Endpoints and Data Analysis and appropriatedilution application and persistence factors The tests areperformed as a part of selfmonitoring permit requirementscompliance biomonitoring inspections toxics sampling inspectionsand special investigations Data from chronic toxicity testsperformed as part of permit requirements are evaluated duringcompliance evaluation inspections and performance auditinspectionsModifications of these tests are also used in toxicityreduction evaluations and toxicity identification evaluations toidentify the toxic components of an effluent to aid in thedevelopment and implementation of toxicity reduction plans and tocompare and control the effectiveness of various treatmenttechnologies for a given type of industry irrespective

described in this methods manualThis manual was prepared in the establishedEMSLCincinnati format USEPA SECTION SHORTTERM METHODS FOR ESTIMATING CHRONIC TOXICITY INTRODUCTIONThe objective of aquatic toxicity tests with effluents orpure compounds is to estimate the safe or no effectconcentration of these substances which is defined as theconcentration which will permit normal propagation of fish andother aquatic life in the receiving waters The endpoints that havebeen considered in tests to determine the adverse effects oftoxicants include death and survival decreased reproduction andgrowth locomotor activity gill ventilation rate heart rateblood chemistry histopathology enzyme activity olfactoryfunction and terata Since it is not feasible to detect andormeasure all of these and other possible effects of toxicsubstances on a routine basis observations in toxicity testsgenerally have been limited to only a few effects such asmortality growth and reproductionAcute lethality is an obvious and easily observed effectwhich accounts for its wide use in the early period of evaluationof the toxicity of pure compounds and complex effluents Theresults of these tests were usually expressed as the concentrationlethal to  of the test organisms LC over relatively shortexposure periods onetofour daysAs exposure periods of acute tests were lengthened theLC and lethal threshold concentration were observed to declinefor many compounds By lengthening the tests to include one or morecomplete life cycles and observing the more subtle effects of thetoxicants such as a reduction in growth and reproduction moreaccurate direct estimates of the threshold or safe concentrationof the toxicant could be obtained However laboratory lifecycletests may not accurately estimate the safe concentration oftoxicants because they are conducted with a limited number ofspecies under highly controlled steadystate conditions and theresults do not include the effects of the stresses to which theorganisms would ordinarily be exposed in the naturalenvironmentAn early published account of a full lifecycle fishtoxicity test was that of Mount and Stephan  In this studyfathead minnows Pimephales promelas were exposed to a gradedseries of pesticide concentrations throughout their life cycle andthe effects of the toxicant on survival growth and reproductionwere measured and evaluated This work was soon followed by fulllifecycle tests using other toxicants and fish speciesMcKim  evaluated the data from  full lifecycletests  of which used the fathead minnow Pimephales promelasand concluded that the embryolarval and early juvenile lifestageswere the most sensitive stages He proposed the use of partiallifecycle toxicity tests with the early lifestages ELS of fishto establish water quality criteriaMacek and Sleight  found that exposure of criticallifestages of fish to toxicants provides estimates of chronicallysafe concentrations remarkably similar to those derived from fulllifecycle toxicity tests They reported that for a great majorityof toxicants the concentration which will not be acutely toxic tothe most sensitive life stages is the chronically safeconcentration for fish and that the most sensitive life stages arethe embryos and fry Critical lifestage exposure was consideredto be exposure of the embryos during most preferably all of theembryogenic incubation period and exposure of the fry for days posthatch for warm water fish with embryogenic periodsranging from onetofourteen days and for  days posthatch forfish with longer embryogenic periods They concluded that in themajority of cases the maximum acceptable toxicant concentrationMATC could be estimated from the results of exposure of theembryos during incubation and the larvae for  daysposthatchBecause of the high cost of full lifecycle fish toxicitytests and the emerging consensus that the ELS test data usuallywould be adequate for estimating chronically safe concentrationsthere was a rapid shift by aquatic toxicologists to   day ELStoxicity tests for estimating chronically safe concentrations inthe late s In USEPA adopted the policy that ELS test data could be usedin establishing water quality criteria if data from full lifecycletests were not available USEPA aPublished reports of the results of ELS tests indicatethat the relative sensitivity of growth and survival as endpointsmay be species dependent toxicant dependent or both Ward andParrish  examined the literature on ELS tests that usedembryos and juveniles of the sheepshead minnow Cyprinodonvariegatus and found that growth was not a statistically sensitiveindicator of toxicity in  of  tests They suggested that theELS tests be shortened to  days posthatch and that growth beeliminated as an indicator of toxic effectsIn a review of the literature on  fish full lifecycleand ELS tests performed to determine the chronically safeconcentrations of a wide variety of toxicants such as metalspesticides organics inorganics detergents and complexeffluents Woltering  found that at the lowest effectconcentration significant reductions were observed in fry survivalin  fry growth in  and egg hatchability in  of thetests He also found that fry survival and growth were very oftenequally sensitive and concluded that the growth response could bedeleted from routine application of the ELS tests The net resultwould be a significant reduction in the duration and cost ofscreening tests with no appreciable impact on estimating MATCs forchemical hazard assessments Benoit et al  however foundlarval growth to be the most significant measure of effect andsurvival to be equally or less sensitive than growth in earlylifestage tests with four organic chemicalsEfforts to further reduce the length of partiallifecycle toxicity tests for fish without compromising theirpredictive value have resulted in the development of an eightdayembryolarval survival and teratogenicity test for fish and otheraquatic vertebrates USEPA  Birge et al  and asevenday larval survival and growth test Norberg and MountThe similarity of estimates of chronically safeconcentrations of toxicants derived from shortterm embryolarvalsurvival and teratogenicity tests to those derived from fulllifecycle tests has been demonstrated by Birge et al Birge and Cassidy  and Birge et al Use of a sevenday fathead minnow Pimephales promelaslarval survival and growth test was first proposed by Norberg andMount at the  annual meeting of the Society for EnvironmentalToxicology and Chemistry Norberg and Mount  This test wassubsequently used by Mount and associates in field demonstrationsat Lima OH USEPA  and at many other locations Growth wasfrequently found to be more sensitive than survival in determiningthe effects of complex effluentsNorberg and Mount  performed three single toxicantfathead minnow larval growth tests with zinc copper and DURSBANusing dilution water from Lake Superior The results werecomparable to and had confidence intervals that overlapped withchronic values reported in the literature for both ELS and fulllifecycle testsMount and Norberg  developed a sevenday cladoceranpartial lifecycle test and experimented with a number of diets foruse in culturing and testing the daphnid Ceriodaphnia reticulataNorberg and Mount  As different laboratories began to usethis cladoceran test it was discovered that apparently more thanone species was involved in the tests conducted by the samelaboratory Berner  studied the problem and determined thatperhaps as many as three variant forms were involved and it wasdecided to recommend the use of the more common Ceriodaphnia dubiarather than the originally reported Ceriodaphnia reticulata Themethod was adopted for use in the first edition of the freshwatershortterm chronic methods USEPA eThe green alga Selenastrum capricornutum bottle testwas developed after extensive design evaluation and applicationfor the National Eutrophication Research Program USEPA  Thetest was later modified for use in the assessment of receivingwaters and the effects of wastes originating from industrialmunicipal and agricultural point and nonpoint sources USEPAaThe use of shortterm toxicity tests including subchronicand chronic tests in the NPDES Program is especially attractivebecause they provide a more direct estimate of the safeconcentrations of effluents in receiving waters than was providedby acute toxicity tests at an only slightly increased level ofeffort compared to the fish full lifecycle chronic and day ELStests and the day daphnid Daphnia magna lifecycletestTYPES OF TESTSThe selection of the test type will depend on the NPDESpermit requirements the objectives of the test the availableresources the requirements of the test organisms and effluentcharacteristics such as fluctuations in effluenttoxicityEffluent chronic toxicity is generally measured using amulticoncentration or definitive test consisting of a controland a minimum of five effluent concentrations The tests aredesigned to provide doseresponse information expressed as thepercent effluent concentration that affects the hatchability grossmorphological abnormalities survival growth andor reproductionwithin the prescribed period of time four to seven days Theresults of the tests are expressed in terms of the highestconcentration that has no statistically significant observed effecton those responses when compared to the controls or the estimatedconcentration that causes a specified percent reduction inresponses versus the controlsUse of passfail tests consisting of a single effluentconcentration eg the receiving water concentration or RWC anda control is not recommended If the NPDES permit has a wholeeffluent toxicity limit for acute toxicity at the RWC it isprudent to use that permit limit as the midpoint of a series offive effluent concentrations This will ensure that there issufficient information on the doseresponse relationship Forexample the effluent concentrations utilized in a test may be  effluent  RWC    RWC  RWC and RWC More specifically if the RWC   appropriate effluentconcentrations may be     and Receiving ambient water toxicity tests commonly employtwo treatments a control and the undiluted receiving water butmay also consist of a series of receiving waterdilutionsA negative result from a chronic toxicity test does notpreclude the presence of toxicity Also because of the potentialtemporal variability in the toxicity of effluents a negative testresult with a particular sample does not preclude the possibilitythat samples collected at some other time might exhibit chronictoxicityThe frequency with which chronic toxicity tests areconducted under a given NPDES permit is determined by theregulatory agency on the basis of factors such as the variabilityand degree of toxicity of the waste production schedules andprocess changesTests recommended for use in this methods manual may bestatic nonrenewal or static renewal Individual methods specifywhich static type of test is to be conductedSTATIC TESTSStatic nonrenewal tests  The test organisms are exposedto the same test solution for the duration of the testStaticrenewal tests  The test organisms are exposed toa fresh solution of the same concentration of sample every  h orother prescribed interval either by transferring the testorganisms from one test chamber to another or by replacing all ora portion of solution in the test chambersADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF TOXICITY TESTTYPES STATIC NONRENEWAL SHORTTERM TOXICITY TESTSAdvantagesSimple and inexpensiveVery cost effective in determining compliance with permitconditionsLimited resources space manpower equipment requiredwould permit staff to perform many more tests in the same amount oftimeSmaller volume of effluent required than for staticrenewal or flowthrough tests DisadvantagesDissolved oxygen DO depletion may result from highchemical oxygen demand COD biological oxygen demand BOD ormetabolic wastesPossible loss of toxicants through volatilization andoradsorption to the exposure vesselsGenerally less sensitive than static renewal because thetoxic substances may degrade or be adsorbed thereby reducing theapparent toxicity Also there is less chance of detecting slugs oftoxic wastes or other temporal variations in wasteproperties STATIC RENEWAL SHORTTERM TOXICITY TESTS AdvantagesReduced possibility of DO depletion from high COD andorBOD or ill effects from metabolic wastes from organisms in thetest solutionsReduced possibility of loss of toxicants throughvolatilization andor adsorption to the exposurevesselsTest organisms that rapidly deplete energy reserves arefed when the test solutions are renewed and are maintained in ahealthier stateDisadvantagesRequire greater volume of effluent than nonrenewaltestsGenerally less chance of temporal variations in wastepropertiesSECTION  HEALTH AND SAFETY GENERAL PRECAUTIONSEach laboratory should develop and maintain an effectivehealth and safety program requiring an ongoing commitment by thelaboratory

TestOrganismsLABORATORY WATER USED FOR CULTURING AND TEST DILUTIONWATER The quality of water used for test organism culturing andfor dilution water used in toxicity tests is extremely importantWater for these two uses should come from the same source Thedilution water used in effluent toxicity tests will depend in parton the objectives of the study and logistical constraints asdiscussed in detail in Section  Dilution Water For testsperformed to meet NPDES objectives synthetic moderately hardwater should be usedThe dilution water used for internal quality assurance testswith organisms food and

SAMPLINGAND HANDLINGSample holding times and temperatures of effluent samplescollected for onsite and offsite testing must conform toconditions described in Section  Effluent and Receiving WaterSampling Sample Handling and Sample Preparation for ToxicityTestsTEST CONDITIONSWater temperature should be maintained within the limitsspecified for each test The temperature of test solutions must bemeasured by placing the thermometer or probe directly into the testsolutions or by placing the thermometer in equivalent volumes ofwater in surrogate vessels positioned at appropriate locationsamong the test vessels Temperature should be recorded continuouslyin at least one test vessel for the duration of each test Testsolution temperatures should be maintained within the limitsspecified for each test DO concentration and pH should be checkedat the beginning of each test and daily throughout the testperiodQUALITY OF TEST ORGANISMSThe health of test organisms is primarily assessed by theperformance survival growth andor reproduction of organisms incontrol treatments of individual tests The health and sensitivityof test organisms is also assessed by reference toxicant testingIn addition to documenting the sensitivity and health of testorganisms reference toxicant testing is used to initiallydemonstrate acceptable laboratory performance Subsection  andto document ongoing laboratory performance SubsectionRegardless of the source of test organisms inhousecultures or purchased from external suppliers the testinglaboratory must perform at least one acceptable reference toxicanttest per month for each toxicity test method conducted in thatmonth Subsection  If a test method is conducted onlymonthly or less frequently a reference toxicant test must beperformed concurrently with each effluent toxicity testWhen acute or shortterm chronic toxicity tests areperformed with effluents or receiving waters using test organismsobtained from outside the test laboratory concurrent toxicitytests of the same type must be performed with a reference toxicantunless the test organism supplier provides control chart data fromat least the last five monthly shortterm chronic toxicity testsusing the same reference toxicant and control conditions seeSection  Test OrganismsThe supplier should certify the species identification ofthe test organisms and provide the taxonomic reference citationand page or names of the taxonomic expertsconsultedIf routine reference toxicant tests fail to meet testacceptability criteria then the reference toxicant test must beimmediately repeatedFOOD QUALITYThe nutritional quality of the food used in culturing andtesting fish and invertebrates is an important factor in thequality of the toxicity test data This is especially true for theunsaturated fatty acid content of brine shrimp nauplii ArtemiaProblems with the nutritional suitability of the food will bereflected in the survival growth and reproduction of the testorganisms in cultures and toxicity tests Artemia cysts and otherfoods must be obtained as described in Section  FacilitiesEquipment and SuppliesProblems with the nutritional suitability of food will bereflected in the survival growth and reproduction of the testorganisms in cultures and toxicity tests If a batch of food issuspected to be defective the performance of organisms fed withthe new food can be compared with the performance of organisms fedwith a food of known quality in sidebyside tests If the food isused for culturing its suitability should be determined using ashortterm chronic test which will determine the affect of foodquality on growth or reproduction of each of the relevant testspecies in culture using four replicates with each food sourceWhere applicable foods used only in chronic toxicity tests can becompared with a food of known quality in sidebysidemulticoncentration chronic tests using the reference toxicantregularly employed in the laboratory QA programNew batches of food used inculturing and testing should be analyzed for toxic organics andmetals or whenever difficulty is encountered in meeting minimumacceptability criteria for control survival and reproduction orgrowth If the concentration of total organochlorine pesticidesexceeds  mgg wet weight or the concentration of totalorganochlorine pesticides plus PCBs exceeds  gg wet weightor toxic metals Al As Cr Cd Cu Pb Ni Zn expressed as totalmetal exceed  gg wet weight the food should not be used foranalytical methods see AOAC  and USDA  For foods egsuch as YCT which are used to culture and test organisms thequality of the food should meet the requirements for the laboratorywater used for culturing and test dilution water as described inSection  aboveACCEPTABILITY OF SHORTTERM CHRONIC TOXICITYTESTSFor the tests to be acceptable control survival infathead minnow Pimephales promelas and the daphnid Ceriodaphniadubia tests must be  or greater At the end of the test theaverage dry weight of surviving sevendayold fathead minnows incontrol chambers must equal or exceed  mg In Ceriodaphniadubia controls  or more of the surviving females must haveproduced their third brood in    days and the number of youngper surviving female must be  or greater In algal toxicitytests the mean cell density in the controls after  h must equalor exceed  x  cellsmL and not vary more than  amongreplicates If these criteria are not met the test must berepeatedAn individual test may be conditionally acceptable iftemperature DO and other specified conditions fall outsidespecifications depending on the degree of the departure and theobjectives of the tests see test condition summaries Theacceptability of the test would depend on the experience andprofessional judgment of the laboratory investigator and thereviewing staff of the regulatory authority Any deviation fromtest specifications must be noted when reporting data from thetest ANALYTICAL METHODSRoutine chemical and physical analyses for culture anddilution water food and test solutions must include establishedquality assurance practices outlined in USEPA methods manualsUSEPA a and USEPA bReagent containers should be dated and catalogued whenreceived from the supplier and the shelf life should not beexceeded Also working solutions should be dated when preparedand the recommended shelf life should be observedCALIBRATION AND STANDARDIZATIONInstruments used for routine measurements of chemical andphysical parameters such as pH DO temperature and conductivitymust be calibrated and standardized according to instrumentmanufacturers procedures as indicated in the general section onquality assurance see USEPA Methods    and in USEPA b Calibration data are recorded in a permanent logbookWet chemical methods used to measure hardness alkalinityand total residual chlorine must be standardized prior to use eachday according to the procedures for those specific USEPA methodssee USEPA Methods  and  in USEPA bREPLICATION AND TEST SENSITIVITYThe sensitivity of the tests will depend in part on thenumber of replicates per concentration the significance levelselected and the type of statistical analysis If the variabilityremains constant the sensitivity of the test will increase as thenumber of replicates is increased The minimum recommended numberof replicates varies with the objectives of the test and thestatistical method used for analysis of the dataVARIABILITY IN TOXICITY TEST RESULTSFactors which can affect test success and precisioninclude  the experience and skill of the laboratory analyst test organism age condition and sensitivity  dilution waterquality  temperature control and  the quality and quantityof food provided The results will depend upon the species used andthe strain or source of the test organisms and test conditionssuch as temperature DO food and water quality The repeatabilityor precision of toxicity tests is also a function of the number oftest organisms used at each toxicant concentration Jensen discussed the relationship between sample size number of fish andthe standard error of the test and considered  fish perconcentration as optimum for Probit AnalysisTEST PRECISIONThe ability of the laboratory personnel to obtainconsistent precise results must be demonstrated with referencetoxicants before they attempt to measure effluent toxicity Thesinglelaboratory precision of each type of test to be used in alaboratory should be determined by performing at least five testswith a reference toxicantTest precision can be estimated by using the same strainof organisms under the same test conditions and employing a knowntoxicant such as a reference toxicantInterlaboratory precision data from a  study ofchronic toxicity tests with two species using the referencetoxicants potassium chloride and copper sulfate are shown in Table Table  shows interlaboratory precision data from a study ofthree chronic toxicity test methods using effluent receivingwater and reference toxicant sample types USEPA a USEPAb The effluent sample was a municipal wastewater spiked withKCl the receiving waster sample was a

DEMONSTRATING ACCEPTABLE LABORATORYPERFORMANCEIt is a laboratorys responsibility to demonstrate itsability to obtain consistent precise results with referencetoxicants before it performs toxicity tests with effluents forpermit compliance purposes To meet this requirement theintralaboratory precision expressed as percent coefficient ofvariation CV of each type of test to be used in the laboratoryshould be determined by performing five or more tests withdifferent batches of test organisms using the same referencetoxicant at the same concentrations with the same test conditionsie the same test duration type of dilution water age of testorganisms feeding etc and the same data analysis methods Areference toxicant concentration series  or higher should beselected that will consistently provide partial mortalities at twoor more concentrationsDOCUMENTING ONGOING LABORATORY PERFORMANCESatisfactory laboratory performance is demonstrated byperforming at least one acceptable test per month with a referencetoxicant for each toxicity test method conducted in the laboratoryduring that month For a given test method successive tests mustbe performed with the same reference toxicant at the sameconcentrations in the same dilution water using the same dataanalysis methods Precision may vary with the test speciesreference toxicant and type of test Each laboratorys referencetoxicity data will reflect conditions unique to that facilityincluding dilution water culturing and other variables howevereach laboratorys reference toxicity results should reflect goodrepeatabilityA control chart should be prepared for each combinationof reference toxicant test species test conditions andendpoints Toxicity endpoints from five or six tests are adequatefor establishing the control charts Successive toxicity endpointsNOECs ICs LCs etc should be plotted and examined todetermine if the results X are within prescribed limits Figure The chart should plot logarithm of concentration on thevertical axis against the date of the test or test number on thehorizontal axis The types of control charts illustrated seeUSEPA a are used to evaluate the cumulative trend of resultsfrom a series of samples thus reference toxicant test resultsshould not be used as a de facto criterion for rejection ofindividual effluent or receiving water tests For endpoints thatarepoint estimates LCs and ICs the cumulative mean X andupper and lower control limits  S are recalculated with eachsuccessive test result Endpoints from hypothesis tests NOECNOAEC from each test are plotted directly on the control chartThe control limits would consist of one concentration intervalabove and below the concentration representing the centraltendency After two years of data collection or a minimum of data points the control chart should be maintained using only the most recent data pointsLaboratories should compare the calculated CV iestandard deviation  mean of the IC for the  most recent datapoints to the distribution of laboratory CVs reported nationallyfor reference toxicant testing Table  in USEPA b If thecalculated CV exceeds the th percentile of CVs reportednationally the laboratory should use the th and th percentilesto calculate warning and control limits respectively and thelaboratory should investigate options for reducing variabilityNote Because NOECs can only be a fixed number of discrete valuesthe mean standard deviation and CV cannot be interpreted andapplied in the same way that these descriptive statistics areinterpreted and applied for continuous variables such as the ICor LCThe outliers which are values falling outside the upperand lower control limits and trends of increasing or decreasingsensitivity are readily identified In the case of endpoints thatare point estimates LCs and ICs at the P probabilitylevel one in  tests would be expected to fall outside of thecontrol limits by chance alone If more than one out of reference toxicant tests fall outside the control limits thelaboratory should investigate sources of variability takecorrective actions to reduce identified sources of variability andperform an additional reference toxicant test during the samemonth Control limits for the NOECs will also be exceededoccasionally regardless of how well a laboratory performs Inthose instances when the laboratory can document the cause for theoutlier eg operator error culture health or test systemfailure the outlier should be excluded from the futurecalculations of the control limits If two or more consecutivetests do not fall within the control limits the resultsmust be explained and the reference toxicant test must beimmediately repeated Actions taken to correct the problem must bereportedIf the toxicity value from a given test with a referencetoxicant falls well outside the expected range for the other testorganisms when using the standard dilution water and other testconditions the laboratory should investigate sources ofvariability take corrective actions to reduce identified sourcesof variability and perform an additional reference toxicant testduring the same month Performance should improve with experienceand the control limits for endpoints that are point estimatesshould gradually narrow However control limits of  S will beexceeded  of the time by chance alone regardless of how well alaboratory performs Highly proficient laboratories which developvery narrow control limits may be unfairly penalized if a testresult which falls just outside the control limits is rejected defacto For this reason the width of the control limits should beconsidered in determining whether or not a reference toxicant testresult falls well outside the expected range The width of thecontrol limits may be evaluated by comparing the calculated CVie standard deviation  mean of the IC for the  mostrecent data points to the distribution of laboratory CVs reportednationally for reference toxicant testing Table  in USEPAb In determining whether or not a reference toxicant testresult falls well outside the expected range the result also maybe compared with upper and lower bounds for S as any resultoutside these control limits would be expected to occur by chanceonly  out of  tests Environment Canada  When a resultfrom a reference toxicant test is outside the  confidenceintervals the laboratory must conduct an immediate investigationto assess the possible causes for the outlierReference toxicant test results should not be used as ade facto criterion for rejection of individual effluent orreceiving water tests Reference toxicant testing is used forevaluating the health and sensitivity of organisms over time andfor documenting initial and ongoing laboratory performance Whilereference toxicant test results should not be used as a de factocriterion for test rejection effluent and receiving water testresults should be reviewed and interpreted in the light ofreference toxicant test results The reviewer should consider thedegree to which the reference toxicant test result fell outside ofcontrol chart limits the width of the limits the direction of thedeviation toward increased test organism sensitivity or towarddecreased test organism sensitivity the test conditions of boththe effluent test and the reference toxicant test and theobjective of the testREFERENCE TOXICANTSReference toxicants such as sodium chloride NaClpotassium chloride KCl cadmium chloride CdCl copper sulfateCuSO sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS and potassium dichromateKCrO are suitable for use in the NPDES Program and otherAgency programs requiring aquatic toxicity tests EMSLCincinnatihopes to release USEPAcertified solutions of cadmium and copperfor use as reference toxicants through cooperative research anddevelopment agreements with commercial suppliers and will continueto develop additional reference toxicants for future releaseStandard reference materials can be obtained from commercial supplyhouses or can be prepared inhouse using reagent grade chemicalsThe regulatory agency should be consulted before referencetoxicants are selected and usedRECORD KEEPINGProper record keeping is important A complete fileshould be maintained for each individual toxicity test or group oftests on closely related samples This file should contain a recordof the sample chainofcustody a copy of the sample log sheet theoriginal bench sheets for the test organism responses during thetoxicity tests chemical analysis data on the samples detailedrecords of the test organisms used in the tests such as speciessource age date of receipt and other pertinent informationrelating to their history and health information on thecalibration of equipment and instruments test conditions employedand results of reference toxicant tests Laboratory data should berecorded on a realtime basis to prevent the loss of information orinadvertent introduction of errors into the record Original datasheets should be signed and dated by the laboratory personnelperforming the testsThe regulatory authority should retain records pertainingto discharge permits Permittees are required to retain recordspertaining to permit applications and compliance for a minimum of years  CFR jSECTION FACILITIES EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES GENERAL REQUIREMENTSEffluent toxicity tests may be

depend on therequirements of the regulatory authority and the objectives of thetest It is essential that good quality test organisms be readilyavailable throughout the year from inhouse or commercial sources tomeet NPDES monitoring requirements The organisms used in thetoxicity tests must be identified to species If there is any doubtas to the identity of the test organism representative specimensshould be sent to a taxonomic expert to confirm theidentificationToxicity test conditions and culture methods for thespecies listed in Subsection  are provided in this manualalso see USEPA aThe organisms used in the shortterm chronic toxicitytests described in this manual are the fathead minnow Pimephalespromelas the daphnid Ceriodaphnia dubia Berner  and thegreen alga Selenastrum capricornutumSome states have developed culturing and testing methodsfor indigenous species that may be as sensitive or more sensitivethan the species recommended in Subsection  However USEPAallows the use of indigenous species only where state regulationsrequire their use or prohibit importation of the recommendedspecies in Subsection  Where state regulations prohibitimportation of nonnative fishes or the use of recommended testspecies permission must be requested from the appropriate stateagency prior to their useWhere states have developed culturing and testing methodsfor indigenous species other than those recommended in this manualdata comparing the sensitivity of the substitute species and theone or more recommended species must be obtained in sidebysidetoxicity tests with reference toxicants andor effluents to ensurethat the species selected are at least as sensitive as therecommended species These data must be submitted to the permittingauthority State or Region if required USEPA acknowledges thatreference toxicants prepared from pure chemicals may not always berepresentative of effluents However because of the observedandor potential variability in the quality and toxicity ofeffluents it is not possible to specify a representativeeffluentGuidance for the selection of testorganisms where the salinity of the effluent andor receiving waterrequires special consideration is provided in the Technical SupportDocument for Water Qualitybased Toxics Control USEPAaWhere the salinity of the receiving water is  freshwater organisms are used regardless of the salinity of theeffluentWhere the salinity of the receiving water is   thechoice of organisms depends on state water quality standards andorpermit requirementsSOURCES OF TEST ORGANISMSThe test organisms recommended in this manual can becultured in the laboratory using culturing and handling methods foreach organism described in the respective test method sections Thefathead minnow Pimephales promelas culture method is given inSection  and not repeated in Section  Also see USEPAaInhouse cultures should be established wherever it iscost effective If inhouse cultures cannot be maintained or it isnot cost effective test organisms or starter cultures should bepurchased from experienced commercial suppliers see USEPAaStarter cultures of the green algae Selenastrumcapricornutum S minutum and Chlamydomonas reinhardti areavailable from commercial suppliersBecause the daphnid Ceriodaphnia dubia must be culturedindividually in the laboratory for at least seven days before thetest begins it will be necessary to obtain a starter culture froma commercial source at least three weeks before the test is tobegin if they are not being cultured inhouseIf because of their source there is any uncertaintyconcerning the identity of the organisms it is advisable to havethem examined by a taxonomic specialist to confirm theiridentification For detailed guidance on identification see theindividual test methodsFERAL NATURAL OCCURRING WILD CAUGHTORGANISMS The use of test organisms taken from the receiving waterhas strong appeal and would seem to be a logical approachHowever it is generally impractical and not recommended for thefollowing reasonsSensitive organisms may not be present in the receivingwater because of previous exposure to the effluent or otherpollutantsIt is often difficult to collect organisms of therequired age and quality from the receiving waterMost states require collecting permits which may bedifficult to obtain Therefore it is usually more cost effectiveto culture the organisms in the laboratory or obtain them fromprivate state or Federal sources The fathead minnow Pimephalespromelas the daphnid Ceriodaphnia dubia and the green algaSelenastrum capricornutum are easily cultured in the laboratory orreadily available commerciallyThe required QAQC records such as the single laboratoryprecision data would not be availableSince it is mandatory that the identity of the testorganism be known to species level it would be necessary toexamine each organism caught in the wild to confirm its identityThis would usually be impractical or at the least very stressfulto the organismsTest organisms obtained from the wild must be observed inthe laboratory for a minimum of one week prior to use to assurethat they are free of signs of parasitic or bacterial infectionsand other adverse effects Fish captured by electroshocking mustnot be used in toxicity testingGuidelines for collecting natural occurring organisms areprovided in USEPA  USEPA  and USEPAbRegardless of their source test organisms should becarefully observed to ensure that they are free of signs of stressand disease and in good physical condition Some species of testorganisms can be obtained from commercial stock certified asdiseasefreeLIFE STAGE Young organisms are often more sensitive to toxicants thanare adults For this reason the use of early life stages such aslarval fish is required for all tests In a given test allorganisms should be approximately the same age and should be takenfrom the same source Since age may affect the results of thetests it would enhance the value and comparability of the data ifthe same species in the same life stages were used throughout amonitoring program at a given facility LABORATORY CULTURINGInstructions for culturing andorholding the recommended test organisms are included in therespective test methods also see USEPA aHOLDING AND HANDLING TEST ORGANISMSTest organisms should not be subjected to changes of morethan C in water temperature in any  h period or  units of pHin any h periodOrganisms should be handled as little as possible Whenhandling is necessary it should be done as gently carefully andquickly as possible to minimize stress Organisms that are droppedor touch a dry surface or are injured during handling must bediscarded Dipnets are best for handling larger organisms Thesenets are commercially available or can be made from smallmeshnylon netting silk batting cloth plankton netting or similarmaterial Widebore smooth glass tubes  to  mm ID with rubberbulbs or pipettors such as PROPIPETTE should be used fortransferring smaller organisms such as larval fishHolding tanks for fish are supplied with good qualitywater see Section  Facilities Equipment and Supplies withflowthrough rate of at least two tank volumes per day Otherwiseuse a recirculation system where water flows through an activatedcarbon or undergravel filter to remove dissolved metabolitesCulture water can also be piped through high intensity ultravioletlight sources for disinfection and to photodegrade dissolvedorganicsCrowding must be avoided because it will stress theorganisms and lower the DO concentrations to unacceptable levelsThe solution of oxygen depends on temperature and altitude The DOmust be maintained at a minimum of  mgL Aerate gently ifnecessaryThe organisms should be observed carefully each day forsigns of disease stress physical damage or mortality Dead andabnormal organisms should be removed as soon as observed It is notuncommon for some fish mortality  to occur during the first h in a holding tank because of individuals that refuse to feedon artificial food and die of starvation Organisms in the holdingtanks should generally be fed as in the cultures see culturingmethods in the respective methodsFish should be fed as much as they will eat at least oncea day with live brine shrimp nauplii Artemia or frozen adultbrine shrimp or dry food frozen food should be completely thawedbefore use Adult brine shrimp can be supplemented withcommercially prepared food such as TETRAMIN or BIORIL flake foodor equivalent Excess food and fecal material should be removedfrom the bottom of the tanks at least twice a week bysiphoningA daily record of feeding behavioral observations andmortality should be maintainedTRANSPORTATION TO THE TEST SITE Organisms are transported from the base or supplylaboratory to a remote test site in culture water or standarddilution water in plastic bags or largemouth screwcap  mLplastic bottles in styrofoam coolers Adequate DO is maintained byreplacing the air above the water in the bags with oxygen from acompressed gas cylinder and sealing the bags or by use of anairstone supplied by a portable pump The DO concentration must notfall below mgL Upon arrival at the test site the organisms aretransferred to receiving water if receiving water is to be used asthe test dilution water All but a small volume of the holdingwater approximately  is removed by siphoning and replacedslowly over a  to  minute period with dilution water Ifreceiving water is to be used as the dilution water caution mustbe exercised in exposing the test organisms to it because of thepossibility that it might be toxic For this reason it isrecommended that only approximately  of the test organisms beexposed initially to the dilution water If this group does notshow excessive mortality or obvious signs of stress in a few hoursthe remainder of the test organisms may be transferred to thedilution waterA group of organisms must not beused for a test if they appear to be unhealthy discolored orotherwise stressed or if mortality appears to exceed  precedingthe test If the organisms fail to meet these criteria the entiregroup must be discarded and a new group obtained The mortality maybe due to the presence of toxicity if the receiving water is usedas dilution water rather than a diseased condition of the testorganisms If the acclimation process is repeated with a new groupof test organisms and excessive mortality occurs it is recommendedthat an alternative source of dilution water be usedTEST ORGANISM DISPOSAL When the toxicity tests is concluded all test organismsincluding controls should be humanely destroyed and disposed ofin an appropriate manner
