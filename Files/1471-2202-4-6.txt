                    Background        Objects in nuclei recognized by antibodies specific for        phosphoprotein epitopes cytoplasmic IFs or both have        been reported in glial and neuronal cells         in situ and         in vitro  The nuclear structures        appear spherical or rodlike and may have a positional        relationship with nuclear pores               Morphologically these structures appear similar to the        nuclear speckles that are thought to be storage sites for        RNA splicing factors       However while        intermediate filament IF phosphoproteins could be        components of nuclear speckles they are immunologically        distinct Investigations of intermediate filaments IF in        the nucleus have focused on lamins see Goldman for a        current review     but many reports of         in situ nuclear localization of        cytoplasmic IFs also exist eg vimentin in association        with nuclear DNA in cultured fibroblasts      and an        estrogensensitive cytokeratin association with nuclear DNA        in human breast cancer cells            In a recent study Glass         et al     using the SMI        monoclonal antibody mAB to identify phosphorylated        neurofilament proteins reported discrete SMI labeling        within nuclei of SHSYY neuroblastoma cells SHSYY cells        are a subclone of the SKNSH human neuroblastoma cell line        derived from neoplastic neural crest cells and under        certain growth conditions generate neuritic processes             Sternberger and Sternberger    describe SMI        mAB as specific for phosphorylated epitopes on the heavy        neurofilaments peptide NFH and to a lesser extent medium        neurofilament peptide NFM The RT mAB    has been        characterized as recognizing phosphorylated epitopes on the         kDa NFH peptide     and used similarly to SMI        to identify neurites         in vitro and         in situ       One would        predict therefore that labeling with RT would produce        staining patterns including nuclear similar to those of        SMI in SHSYY cells        The nuclear localization of RT and SMI mAB could        be the result of an association of phosphorylated NFs with        nuclear components Alternatively it could be that lamins        or other nuclear proteins have a phosphorylated epitope        also found on NFs For example Schilling         et al    identified nuclear        structures using SMI mAB in rat glial nuclei         in vitro and         in vivo  and Shea         et al    showed both SMI and        RT strongly labeled nuclei of NBa neuroblastoma cells        Herrera    demonstrated nuclear localization patterns        similar to those obtained by Glass         et al     using rat glioma        cells L immunolabeled with the J mAB which appears        to recognize a phosphorylated form of GFAP             These observations prompted us to further investigate        nuclear antigens in SHSYY neuroblastoma cells and to        attempt to determine the relationship between these nuclear        objects and cellular growth dynamics We asked the        following questions  are the immunolabeled structures        within the nucleus or just closely associated  is the        phosphoepitope labeled by SMI and RT mABs specific to        NFs or can it be identified on other IFs in other cell        types and  is there a relationship between the cell        cycle as determined by DNA synthesis and the amount of        nuclear labeling by SMI and RT                    Results                  The immunolabeled structures are within the          nucleus          As visualized by confocal microscopy the SMI and          RT mABs labeled discrete locations apparently within          nuclei and revealed a filamentous network in the          cytoplasm Figure AB The nuclear structures were          clearly seen to be located seen within nuclei when          visualized by confocal zprojections and this location          was confirmed by demonstrating mAB staining and DNA in          single optical planes  nm thick The nuclei were found          to be  to  m thick or about  to  optical section          thick The nuclear structures were also found to          colocalize with nuclear DNA using the colocalization          function of the BioRad LaserSharp software data not          shown Therefore within the limits of resolution of          confocal microscopy SMI mAB and RT mAB label          epitopes in SHSYY cells that are inside the          nucleus                          The phosphoepitope labeled by SMI and RT is          not specific to NFs and it can be identified on other          IFs in other cell types          SMI mAB labeled F rat glioma nuclei and cytoplasm          with equal or greater avidity than in SHSYY cells          Figure D The cytoplasmic staining produced by SMI          was not distinguishable from that produced by antiGFAP          in the F glioma cells Figure F F glioma cells are          not known to express neurofilament protein and SMI a          mAB characterized as specific for nonphosphorylated NFs              stained the expected cytoplasmic network in          SHSYY cells Figure C but did not label any          structures in F glioma cells data not shown Thus it          appears that SMI recognizes a phosphoepitope that          occurs on proteins in addition to NFH and NFM as          previously reported see the Discussion for other reports          of SMI staining glial cells           in situ  RT also labeled          nuclear and cytoplasmic structures in F cells Figure          E          Electrophoretic and western analysis of SHSYY and          F cell extracts corroborated the finding that SMI          recognized an epitope on proteins other than NFs In          SHSYY cell extracts the SMI and SMI lanes show          strong labeling of bands corresponding to the MW of NFH          and NFM Additional bands not seen in the SMI lane          are present in the SMI and RT lanes between and          above the NFH and NFM and probably represent forms of          NFM and NFH with varying degrees of phosphorylation          SMI and RT also revealed a band or closely spaced          bands at  kDa which corresponds approximately to the MW          of lamins Western analysis using antilamin B revealed a          similar  kDa band in extracts of SHSYY cells but no          bands were labeled by antilamin AC Labeled bands below           kDa may represent degradation products produced during          cell extraction Normal serum controls were negative          data not shown          Western analysis with antiGFAP pAB SMI mAB RT          mAB and antilamins mAB was performed on F cell          extracts subjected to SDSPAGE The antiGFAP lane shows          a strong band at the expected MW and multiple bands          above it as well as minor bands below The higher MW          bands most likely represent GFAP multimers while the          lower MW bands are possibly degradation products          Multiple bands also appear in both the SMI and RT          lanes although for the most part the antibodies do not          appear to label the same bands In lanes labeled with          SMI RT or antilamin B a weak but well defined          band appears at approximately  kDa Figure  Controls          normal mouse serum were negative data not shown          Numerous putative phosphorylation motifs were          identified in the amino acid sequences of NFH GFAP and          nuclear lamins A B and C when analyzed by the NetPhos          server including a single tyrosine kinase motif LNDRFAG                    Y IDKVR found in the Nterminal          region of all five proteins see Figure  In addition           putative serine    threonine   and           other tyrosine   phosphorylation sites were          identified however only the tyrosine phosphorylation          site shown was shared among the five proteins analyzed          Therefore it is possible that this sequence constitutes          or contains the epitope recognized by the SMI and          RT mABs and may account for the crossreactivity of          these antibodies with respect to NFH GFAP and          lamins                          DNA synthesis and the volume and intensity of          nuclear labeling are related          Analyses of nuclear labeling intensity and comparison          to proliferation index as a function of days in culture          revealed a strong correlation Comparison of nuclear          labeling of SHSYY cells immunostained with SMI and          RT mABs to the culture proliferation index shows that          nuclear labeling reached its greatest extent when DNA          synthesis was also maximal Both values fell as cells          exited the cell cycle as indicated by lack of BrdU          uptake and by day  when the cultures appear confluent          essentially all cell replication had stopped see Figure          GHIand Figure                             Discussion        SHSYY cells immunolabeled with SMI mAB or RT mAB        demonstrated discrete nuclear localizations in nuclei with        pronounced staining in neuronal processes and diffuse        staining within cell bodies Confocal microscopy        demonstrated clearly that the antibodies label structures        within the nucleus Comparison among antibodies that are        specific for phosphorylated IFs SMI RT and those        not SMI antiGFAP suggests that the nuclear        structures are a phosphorylated IF Cross reactivity of        both SMI and RT on glial cytoplasm and nuclei        indicates the epitope is not cell type specific        Examination of western blots indicate SMI and RT        recognize among others a protein in the    kDa range        in extracts of both neuroblastoma and glioma cells Western        analysis with antilamin B labeled a similar band in the        same extracts The calculated molecular weights of lamins        A B and C are approximately   and  kDa        respectively therefore it seems most likely that lamins        NFH and GFAP all share a common motif that when        phosphorylated is recognized by SMI and RT mABs In        support of this a search for phosphorylation motifs among        NFH GFAP and lamins A B and C revealed a single high        probability tyrosine site that occurs once on each of these        proteins Figure  further suggesting the possibility        that this site constitutes or is contained within the        epitope recognized by these two antibodies        Based on the finding of a shared tyrosine        phosphorylation site it seems likely that the nuclear        structures reported in this and previous studies            that employed SMI are phosphorylated lamins        Furthermore nuclear labeling and DNA synthesis appeared        tightly associated in SHSYY cultures consistent with the        suspected role of lamins in DNA replication     Others        have reported SMI labeling in glial as well as neuronal        nuclei For example Schilling         et al    identified        developmentally regulated nuclear antigens recognized by        SMI mAB in C rat glioma cells         in vitro as well as glial and        neuronal nuclei         in vivo  suggesting the presence        nonneurofilament epitopes In addition Shea         et al      in a study of        neurite outgrowth from NBa cells showed that both the        SMI and RT mABs strongly labeled nuclei of        undifferentiated cells and the nuclear labeling declined        as differentiation progressed These results are similar to        the results reported here In a recent paper by Glass         et al     SMI was described        as labeling nuclear epitopes in cells in culture and in        neurons of mature rat brain as visualized by        cryosectioning and confocal microscopy However in light        of the findings reported here the nuclear objects reported        by Glass         et al in rat brain sections may have        been in mitotically active glial cells as well as in        neurons        Although these nuclear epitopes appear similar to        nuclear speckles the latter have not been reported as        IFassociated structures but rather storage sites of RNA        processing proteins see Sanford  for a current brief        review     However as it is know that lamins are        involved in nucleoskeletal organization    and        organization of DNA replication sites     it would not        be unexpected to find lamins associated with nuclear        speckles perhaps as structural organizers                    Conclusions        Both RT and SMI may recognize the phosphorylated        tyrosine motif LNDRFAG         Y IDKVR which occurs in NFH and        thus provides the basis for the claim of these antibodies        being specific for phosphorylated NFs     However        this same motif occurs in GFAP and lamins A B and C and        possibly other proteins and is not restricted to neurons        as shown by the glial staining reported here and in other        studies     It would be interesting to look at nuclei        from a variety of tissue types using these antibodies as        probes        In this study and in previous studies performed in other        laboratories      a close relationship between the        nuclear phosphoepitopes and growth phase has been reported        Because of the association of phosphorylated lamins with        DNA replication and the cell cycle     and the sharing        of phosphoepitopes among lamins NFs and GFAP it seems        most probable that the nuclear epitopes revealed in        neuroblastoma and glioma cells by SMI and RT are        contained on lamin B                    Methods                  Preparation and Maintenance of Cell Cultures          All culture reagents were obtained from Sigma St          Louis MO unless otherwise noted SHSYY cells were          maintained in culture as previously described              Initial cell density was determined using a hemacytometer          Fisher Scientific Pittsburgh PA and diluted          appropriately to maintain a seeding density of             cellscm of surface area Cells were grown for          approximately  hours and fixed in cold methanol unless          otherwise indicated F rat glioma cells ATCC          httpwwwatccorg Manassas VA were also used for          comparative purposes in this study and were cultured as          described for SHSYY cells                          Fixation and Immunofluorescence Staining for          Confocal Microscopy          Cells grown on coverslips were washed briefly in a          phosphatebuffered saline PBS solution pH   mM          NaCl  mM KCl  mM Na            HPO              mM KH            PO             and then either fixed in           methanol at C for  minute or at room temperature in          a  formaldehyde PFA solution freshly made from          paraformaldehyde Electron Microscopy Sciences Ft          Washington PA and buffered with PBS or PBS with           Tween PBST for  minutes followed by  washes in          PBSPBST for  minutes each As a previous study             had suggested nuclear staining by antibodies targeted to          cytoplasmic proteins might be fixation dependent    or          an artifact of fixation we did a preliminary comparison          of SMI labeling of methanol vs paraformaldehyde fixed          cells We found minor differences in the staining pattern          between methanol and paraformaldehyde fixed cells but          immunolabeled nuclear structures were visible regardless          of fixation No differences in the localization of mAB          staining in the cells was noted when comparing between          the two methods of fixation          After fixation the cellbearing coverslips were          incubated in  nonfat powdered milk in PBS to block          nonspecific proteinprotein interactions for  hours at          room temperature The coverslips were then washed           times  minutes each and incubated with the desired          primary antibody Table  for  hours at C The          cells were again washed three times in PBS  minutes          each and incubated with the appropriate secondary          antibody Table  for  hours at room temperature          During the final  minutes of secondary antibody          incubation  l of TOPRO T Molecular Probes          Eugene OR a DNA specific probe was added for          identification of nuclei Table  Negative controls for          all immunopreparations were prepared by use of the          appropriate normal serum in place of the primary          antibody The coverslips were then mounted on glass          slides in a medium consisting of  glycerol in water          containing  mgml pphenylenediamine and stored at          C in the dark                          Microscopy and Quantitative Analysis of          Immunolabeling          An Olympus IX fitted with a BioRad MRC           confocal scanhead via the Keller port was used for all          image acquisition Initial image processing was done          using BioRad LaserSharp software running on a Compaq PC          final processing and printing of images was done using          Adobe Photoshop  software          Culture dynamics were determined for SHSYY          neuroblastoma cells at an initial density of             cellscm  Cells were introduced into five  cm          flasks then harvested from one flask each day using           ml Pucks saline solution pH   mM NaCl  mM          KCl  mM Na            HPO              mM HEPES  mM dextrose and           mM EDTA Detached cells were pelleted at  rpm          for  minutes in a clinical centrifuge and resuspended in           ml of PBS Cell density was determined each day by          counting the number of cells present in representative          samples using a twochambered hemacytometer A          proliferation index was calculated as the percentage of          nuclei present engaged in DNA synthesis using BrdU          uptake as an indicator see part D below for BrdU          labeling method also see Figure           Quantitation of fluorescent labeling was performed on          confocal images collected using calibrated microscope          channel settings for cells grown  days All images          were collected from cells stained at the same time with          the same batch of antibody Thus any differences in          staining intensity and area stained were expected to be a          function of time in culture andor culture density This          entire process was performed in duplicate          Confocal stacks were projected and then imported into          NIH Image  software freeware at          httprsbinfonihgovnihimage Density slice          filtering was used to remove background autofluorescence          and then record the area stained in each nucleus in the          flattened image Intensity values above background were          also determined but not used as they were found          insensitive to growth conditions and more sensitive to          nuclear thickness the number of optical sections in the          projected stack than to experimental parameters The          area per nucleus stained is not affected by the number of          sections in the projected stack and was significantly          related to culture conditions These data were used to          relate nuclear area stained to time in culture          Statistical analysis was done using linear regression and          single factor analysis of variance ANOVA                          Identification of Actively Growing Cells using          BromoDeoxyuridine          Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips at an initial          density of    cellscm and allowed to grow for           days Twentyfour hours prior to fixation the cells          were incubated with  M bromodeoxyuridine in MEM          see Table  At the appropriate time the cells were          fixed in methanol at C for  minutes allowed to          air dry then stored at C until all coverslips were          ready for processing The cells were rehydrated in PBS          for  minutes followed by immersion in N HCl for  hour          at room temperature The cells were incubated in  M          borate buffer pH   M boric acid  mM Na            B            O             and  mM NaCl twice for           minutes each  minutes total followed by three           minute washes in PBS Next cells were immunolabeled          using antiBrdU monoclonal mouse IgG primary antibody          followed by goat antimouse IgG conjugated to AlexaFluor           see Tables and  All antibody incubations were           hour at room temperature in reduced light During the          final  minutes of secondary antibody incubation          TOPRO nucleic acid stain Molecular Probes was added          at a  dilution The coverslips were then washed and          mounted for microscopic analysis The intensity and          areanucleus of BrdU labeling was quantitated as          described above for immunolabeling                          Preparation of Total Cell Lysates Electrophoresis          and Western Blot Analysis          Cells were seeded at an initial density of             cellscm and grown in  cm flasks for  days MEM          was removed and cells were detached from the substrate          using  ml Pucks saline solution and incubated at C          for  minutes The detached cells were transferred to a          centrifuge tube and spun at  rpm for  minutes The          pellet was resuspended in  volumes of   sample buffer           mM TrisHCl  glycerol  SDS  mM          mercaptoethanol  bromphenol blue and  mM EGTA          then diluted  in PBS Samples were incubated in          boiling water for  minutes then passed through a          gauge and gauge needle repeatedly to shear          chromosomal DNA The lysates were centrifuged at             g for  minutes then aliquoted          and stored at C prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate          polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDSPAGE and western          analysis as previously described     Protein          concentrations of the cell lysates were determined using          the BioRad Protein Assay Hercules CA and sample          volumes adjusted so that  g of total protein were          loaded into wells of a discontinuous  separating           stacking polyacrylamide gel Gels were prepared in          duplicate and one of each pair stained in Coomassie blue          and the other used for electrophoretic transfer onto a          nitrocellulose membrane BioRad Hercules CA The          identities of the proteins bound to the nitrocellulose          membrane were revealed using the appropriate primary and          secondary antibodies Tables and  Molecular weight          values were determined by calculating Rf ratios as the          distance from the bottom of the well to the protein band          of interest divided by the distance from the bottom of          the well to the dye front Standard curves were developed          using log MW of protein standards versus Rf ratio of          those standards Apparent molecular weights of proteins          identified by western blot analysis were determined by          extrapolating MW from the standard curve using measured          Rf ratios                          Identification of Consensus Phosphorylation Motifs          in IF proteins          Amino acid sequences for human NFH

serine          threonine or tyrosine phosphorylation motifs for NFH          were then compared to the aligned proteins in regions of          high identity as determined by reliability scores          generated by the MatchBox server                                Authors contributions        SW designed and performed the experimental aspects of        this work as her masters thesis DG provided
