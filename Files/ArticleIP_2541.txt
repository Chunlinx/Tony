                                 Push Me Pull You                           Thisinaugurates a new monthly column about developments on the Internet The authorhappens to be Slate s chief computer guy but the column is intended foran audience as innocent of technology as he is about a lot of the stuff theywrite about in the Back of the Book                        Microsoft recently announcedan alliance with a company called PointCast The press heralded this deal as confirmation thatpush is the latest Big Thing for the Web Push refers to the way thatinformation gets delivered Do you have to go to it pull Or does it come toyou push The conventional way to read your favorite Internet content is todial up to the Internet find your favorite sites wait for them to downloadnavigate to items of interest wait for them to download and so forth Thatspulland the pull had better be pretty strong or youll give up Pushtechnology by contrast is supposed to do all this for you It dials upconnects to selected sites downloads certain information and arranges it inan easytoread formatall while you sleep or are otherwise living yourlife The advantage to you is that its all there waiting to be read at fastharddrive speed instead of slow modem speed The advantage to the informationprovider is that information pushed at customers is more likely to find themthan information they must go out and pull            Onemetaphor commonly applied here is a newspaper being delivered to your doorinstead of your having to pick it up at the newsstand Given the Internetsunreliability a more appropriate metaphor might be sending a highly traineddog to the newsstand to pick up the paper Most of the time youd get theNew York Times  but some of the time youd get Fire HydrantWeekly and occasionally your dog would just wander off looking for abone Still its an improvement            PointCast is the most successful push technology so farThe company provides a free piece of software downloadable from its site thatallows you to select from a handful of channels sports business arts andentertainment etc At set intervals the software instructs your computer toconnect to the Internet go to the companys site and download the latest newsin those categories It also downloads some ads Then whenever your computerhas been idle for a few minutes this news and these ads pop up on the customscreen saver the software has installed on your machine Because the materialis presented after the download is complete the display is fast And becausethe process uses the companys own software and not a standard Web browser thedisplay is customized to the task at hand making it attractive andeyecatching            In factusing PointCast you quickly realize that this is nothing like having anewspaper delivered This is a lot more like watching television That helps toexplain PointCasts popularity The company claims that  million users havedownloaded its software to date and that its site gets  million hits a dayA  though is an elusive concept But PointCasts success at push isdrawing lots of rivals both small startups and the big boys            PointCast essentially sells three services inone The first automatically connects to the Internet and downloads things soyou can read them offline The second finds and collects things that interestyou The third presents them effectively Other companies offer Webofflinereading technologies The first generation of these such as WebWhacker Milktruck nowWebExand FreeLoader allwork pretty much the same way You tell the software which sites you wantdownloaded and the software tells your computer to do it at prearrangedtimes            But whatdoes it mean to download a site A site is a collection of pages linkedtogether as well as to other pages on other sites How many pages should thesoftware download Too few and youre missing out on something Too many andyou might overflow your hard drive These companies solve this problem bymaking relationships with specific sites that agree to tailor a version to thatcompanys software Thats why some sites like Slate sport FreeLoader logoswhile others like the WallStreet Journal might recommend WebEx            Acompany called Peak Media uses similar technology to take a different approachtrying to make online browsing more satisfying PeakNetJet software uses idle modem time to download pages it thinksbased onpages you frequentyou probably want to read For instance every so often Ivisit the Dilbert archive To read two weeks of cartoons I would have toclick on each cartoons date and wait for that image to download Peak NetJetpromises to remember that I like that page and to download it all for me aheadof time while I surf elsewhere When I go back I find that it has alreadydownloaded the last two weeks cartoons making my experience fast andeasy            Unfortunately for these companies the technology to download sites ahead oftime is simple In the past small companies have innovated with features likedisk compression and virus checking only to find themselves squeezed out whenthose features were incorporated into basic operating systems like Windows andOS So if downloading sites is simple why shouldnt Microsoft build thatcapability into Internet Explorer or Netscape into Navigator Well they areMicrosofts Internet Explorer  will provide an Active Desktop which showspushed content right there behind your Windows windows Netscape has asimilar product in development called Constellation            Smaller companies therefore must distinguishthemselves by the content they gather and how they present it if they are tocompete In the Internet world where contenteven good contentisproliferating rapidly a very good filter will be needed to sort out whatinterests you from what doesnt PointCast has succeeded so far with amassmarket approachrelatively few news sources sorted into relatively fewbuckets IndividualInc in which Slate publisher Microsoft owns a minority interest providesa hightech clipping service called NewsPage You choose from thousands of distinct topics andcompanies and have relevant articles from over  sources delivered to you byemail or to a personalized Web page Other companies such as Cognisoft take this sameapproach to corporate intranets internal networks hoping that pushtechnology will be even more useful in distributing the right information tothe right employees            Anotherpush technology to watch is Marimbas Castanet which attempts to generalize the techniqueUnlike PointCast which downloads its own content and the offline readerclones which download only Web pages Castanet can download Java applicationsand applets in addition to Web pages            Although much of this software isadvertisingdrivenhence freeyou will still pay a price All these productsdownload content whether you actually read it or not Since not everyone willread everything they order up at no charge an enormous amount of pointless nettraffic is being generated As if the Web wasnt slow enough already In factsome corporations have banned PointCast because it was causing huge increasesin their net traffic PointCast responded with a piece of software forcompanies central computers designed to minimize its own impact And thisones not free Its almost a protection racket You give away your softwarefree to a companys employees A few weeks later you saunter over and sayNice little corpnet youve got heretoo bad its getting all clogged up Buyour software and well keep it running smoothly Once a company buys thatsoftware it is less likely to switch content providers So maybe its morelike dealing drugs Either way everybody wins The employees read their newsthe company has a clear net again and its a nice annuity for PointCast
