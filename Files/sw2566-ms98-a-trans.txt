              okay do you have any children   no i dont     you dont   do you   yes i have a one a five year old daughter   uhhuh did you ever have her in child care   yes i do she was um at a private well i stayed off work with her for little over for of a year when she was born and then i   uhhuh   had her at a private sitter for i guess two two and a half years after that   and how did you choose that sitter   um she was referred to me by a couple of people and she turned out to be wonderful i couldnt have asked for anything better i dont think   yeah   i didnt want to send send her straight to a day care   right   and even though she was that old i still didnt want her to go to a day care   yeah   and this lady you would think it was her own   really   yeah shes real good   its hard to find people like that   yes it is and um now i have got her in a Montessori school   uhhuh   and shes really really doing good and learning a lot and actually ive started working up there in the afternoons too so   oh yeah       well thats neat   yeah well yeah i guess im going to quit as soon as school the school seasons over but uh i really enjoyed being with her up there i hate it for her she has to stay that much longer but um   yeah do they have classes for them during the summer too   yeah they they go full uh yearround uh teach them now in the summer they have like a lot of field trips   huh yeah   theres a field trip just about every day if they want to go on one and stuff like that its a lot more lax but but they still go through all their uh curriculum as usual   what kind of questions did you ask about that private sitter before you took her over there   um gosh  i can my husband and i both went we kind of give her the third degree   uh good  im glad to hear that   yeah well we went over to her house so we told her you know prior well we didnt tell her we just told here wed be over that day we didnt tell her when so that way i didnt think you you know the house would be you you know cleaned or anything for me specifically   yeah right   and um she had a daughter and i want to say her daughter was like six or seven right around first second grade and um at the time she kept another one other child um about a four four year old i believe but it was only like a parttime basis so we went over there and we questioned her about what she fed them and um what she did with them during the day and um you know just how she treated them how how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and stuff like that   yeah   and uh we really seem to be pleased with her and um   did you did you introduce your daughter to her before you made your decision   yes oh yes and she still loves her to death i mean when they see each other you know they just love each other to death and she literally spent       almost the entire amount that i paid her on my daughter either making her clothes or buying her things   really yeah oh my   so were real real lucky but after uh so she stayed with her about roughly two years and she um she had to go back to work they had some other expenses that came up so she had to go i guess get a real job   yeah get a real job full time   yeah so uh   so what made you decide to put her in a Montessori school   well i checked a lot of places out you know the kinder cares and the stuff like that and   uhhuh   uh i live in Garland and theres this Montessori school thats nearby   yeah   and um it had been recommended by some friends of ours but uh it its an older place and so i uh checked out all the new places that were near us and then i checked that place out and uh even though it was older it was it was real comfortable and i guess kind of homey   uhhuh yeah   and they didnt just play all day long you know like i noticed a lot of these other schools that i went  may I have some JELLO  yeah and interviewed on or interviewed at um they did a lot of play work and stuff and then they almost all of them had a Montessori section and i thought well gosh that must be pretty good   huh   you know if everybodys trying to incorporate a little bit of it into into their school and they made sure they pointed it out you know   yeah yeah   but after i looked at this place and i took Randi with me uh i think just about to every place one place i think i didnt take her and i just kind of let her go see see what she felt like doing   uhhuh yeah   and that place boy if somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them and its hard to drag her away       so i felt more comfortable at that place   thats the true test   yeah and she was real comfortable and she has really really done good i i   yeah   its hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her   yeah   but she seems to me to be you know pretty quick and smart and shes already reading and writing and stuff like that and she just turned five last month   thats good huh that is good then   so yeah i think so i mean i didnt want to rush school at her the whole time but   no especially when going to spend the next eighteen years in school   exactly exactly i wanted to quit my job so i could stay home with her the next five months because i know shes going to have to face that       yeah really really   and oh my God here we go you know i just hate that but   thats right   anyway so you dont have any children do you have any little nieces or nep hews  then   yeah yeah i have a nephew hes a little brat       he goes to a really crummy day school uh my sisters not real bright so but he hes always sick i mean he has always got some kind of cold or something and i dont know i dont think this place is a very good place for him   oh really oh   its just kind of convenient and shes the kind that goes for convenience over anything else   oh really just easy to get them there and stuff   yeah exactly   well thats a shame   yeah i dont think she checks things out very well   oh really thats scary   which really surprises me it is scary yeah   yeah i was i was petrified   because i know       i would be too   i mean thats a i dont know thats just it and thats why i dont mind paying more   yeah   um i dont know i just feel more     too many horror stories out there that you know   yes and thats one reason i like working up there a little bit is because i know whats really going on   oh yeah thats right i think thats an ideal situation   because you dont know uh because like at her school um as soon as you drive up its got like a circular type drive they sit and they have car callers and and some kid goes out and gets the kid and its time to go   yeah huh   well at first that always kind of bothered me i mean not bothered me but i thought well you know id like to see what shes doing you know   yeah   but now that im there i mean its its a lot more convenient because theres so many kids that dawdle   uhhuh yeah   you know when their parents come and its hard to get them out and a lot of parents have places to go and and things like that and its late at night so     thats right   you know now it doesnt bother me at all but     is that on where the over there off of like im not sure what the street is is it off of near Country Club and um yeah   yeah sixty six that one thats set back in the woods yeah thats it   yeah okay i ive seen the signs but ive never actually seen the place itself you know its pretty set far back off the road   yeah right right it wont and thats something i like too because   yeah definitely   a lot of those places are like you know the one over here on seventy eight Skaggs that little Kinder Care whatever it is   uhhuh yeah   you know its right there on which this is on a highway too but its set back enough to   right yeah theres a difference   im scared i would be scared to death my child might accidentally get out or or if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could you know go in and get one   uhhuh yeah yep thats right or you know in a a car accident   yeah and that was one of the places i had checked out   yeah   and it was it it was brand new when i checked it out and of course it was beautiful and clean and smelled wonderful in there but   yeah     you know i that i didnt base everything on that           no because that all wears off   thats right thats exactly right you get some kids in there and its over quick     yep   but um       ive been real pleased knock on wood im scared to death her going to public school   really   i dont know i well i do know why because   i would be too yeah yep yeah   you know drugs drugs and everything else and they talk about how soon they start that and that scares me   i know it is scary   i mean youre just with them   do they teach them in school right now where shes at about drugs   yeah theyve um theyve had police officers come in   good   and talk to them about it but of course they still have no concept of   right   what in the world drugs are you know but   yeah and what to do when theyre faced with it   right but i just think of her you know next year shes going to be five six years old in kindergarten in same school with you know uh i guess ten year olds isnt that six sixth sixth grade you know and thats a big gap   yeah it is   and thats uh that i can honestly see the peer pressure there   uhhuh   and that just   oh i can see it too   terrifies me to death and stuff those kids getting snatched and   uhhuh   im im probably a little too over protective  but   nothing wrong with that   well nowadays you have to be     yes you do i dont i dont think theres anything wrong with that   if so i at first thought you know when i didnt have kids i was going God how can you be so protective you know  but   uhhuh   its easy now   uhhuh now you understand   yeah definitely   thats what im thinking what your mom and dad always used to say when you have kids of your own youll understand   thats exactly right and i do   uhhuh   but anyway well are you ever are you  are you are you married   yes   are yall planning on having kids or   yeah wed like to   well thats good   yeah   thats good theyre really neat its just
