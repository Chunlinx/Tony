                                 Generals and Their Privates            The WashingtonPost leads with a report that cocaine and marijuana seizures in thesouthwestern US and along Mexicos Pacific coast have escalated dramaticallyin the past two years The story states that the increase reflects moresmuggling into this country and also increased drug production in Mexico andColombia The New YorkTimes reports that President Clinton will sign a bill today permittingthe US to provide food to Christian rebels in Sudan whove been fightingMoslem authorities there for  years This would be the paper says areversal of current US law that prohibits food assistance to combatantsbefore they demobilize The move is stirring up fears in and out of governmentthat the US is becoming more interventionist and that it is violating afundamental principle of international humanitarian assistancethat foodshould not be a weapon The story makes it clear that there is heartfeltdisagreement about this within the administration by quoting by name governmentofficials on both sides The Los Angeles Times leads with the uncovering by state and FBIinvestigators of a giant ripoff of Californias statefederal programproviding health care to the poor The scam involved phony storefront medicalsupply businesses being reimbursed by the state for providing supplies thatnever were purchased for patients who didnt exist The paper says the falseclaims paid may total more than  billion So far  supply business ownershave pleaded guilty Most of those charged says the LAT  have Armeniansurnames USA Todayleads with a bullish report on retail sales over the Thanksgiving weekend TheInternet sales figures the paper passes along for the period includeYahooorders up  times over last year Amazon times None of the leads iseven fronted by anybody else            The WP story about drugs is consistently buttressed by appeal toUS law enforcement sources but it could sorely use some independent expertvoices because it never really comes to grip with the seeming indeterminism ofits data In other words the piece suggests that more seizures equals moreproduction But its just as easy to imagine that more seizures equals betterlaw enforcement vs the same level of production And indeed the WPfurther confuses on this point by also claiming that Mexican opium and heroinproduction are way up while seizures of Mexican opium and heroin are waydown            And does the NYT lead really have the current law about food aidright If so the paper should have explained how it squares with past USsupport for Afghanistan forces against the Soviets and for contras against theNicaraguan government or for Israel against various Arab countries etc Arewe to understand that these aid packages didnt include food And is it reallytrue that guns are OK but not butter When did this law go into effect            Both the LAT and NYT front stories about women in themilitary but look at the topic differently The LAT emphasizes thatwomen consistently leave the service at higher rates than men The NYTfocuses on the difficulties mothers have getting to the highest rankgeneraland admiral The closest the LAT comes to mentioning the latter is itsth paragraph about the special obstacles for womens military careers posedby their family issues And the NYT doesnt get to the problem ofasymmetrical attrition until its st graph            It seems that the LAT has got hold of a national problem while theNYT story while interesting is more of a curio After all accordingto the LAT  in the Army the difference in the attrition rates for menand women is  percent while by the NYT s own lights there are only women generals or admirals But the LAT story still has someproblems It waits till its seventh paragraph to notice that across theservices the gender difference in attrition is only  percent and till theth paragraph to mention that unmarried women can get pregnant and still getout of the service with an honorable discharge and even then never pauses towonder how closing this loophole might change the situation            Challenge to all papers doing stories about trends in the military Trydoing your next one without quoting Charles Moskos military sociologist ofNorthwestern University This is apparently impossible            An editorial in last Saturdays WP about the Talibans harboring ofOsama bin Laden exemplifies some of the pointlessness of this hidebound genreThe editorial wraps up thus Now that they control most of the nationalterritory and are responsible for affairs of state the Afghan authorities haveto take more seriously their responsibility to rein in terrorism The newPakistani government has to reevaluate too Pakistan has supported the Talibanas part of its militarys longtime reach for an active regional foreign policyBut Pakistan needs a quiet policy that will allow it to rebuild at home Sodoes Afghanistan Who exactly is this editorial directed at Does anyone atthe Post think Afghanistan or Pakistan or perhaps bin Laden himselfwill just put down this sterling prose and change            The WP reports that the Baltimore Sun has fired a music criticfor lifting a paragraph from a music reference book Todays Papers recallsthat the Sun also fired an obituary writer last summer for making upquotes Which makes Todays Papers wonderWhy no official reaction to its itemlast week noticing an identical paragraph in WP and NYTobituaries of the same man Why are these two papers willing to let theSun be the most ethical paper in America
