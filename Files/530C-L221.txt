              August        Name Address City ST Zip      Dear Name      This fall alumni and students at the Indiana University School of Law      Indianapolis will initiate several programs to encourage alumni support      for the school      As outlined during recent meetings of the Board of Visitors and Alumni      Association Directors these will include an Indianapolis law      studentalumni telephone campaign and increased emphasis on giving at the      Maennerchor Society level      Prior to launching these programs we are requesting each of our      alumni leaders and friends on the two boards to review their support of      the school for  and if no pledge or contribution has been made to      consider joining their colleagues in the Maennerchor Society      As an alumnus and Chairman of that activity my function is to beat      the drums for financial contributions of  or more per year from      alumni and friends of the school Accordingly a brief recital of unmet      needs is given below with a request for contributions Also I want to      express my gratitude to those of you who have already pledged or      contributed in       These comments for better or worse are not accompanied by      heartrending pictures of faculty members standing in bread lines nor with      snap shots of undernourished law students The schools staff appears      quite professional and the students reasonably fed However the school      does have specific needs some quite visible and others somewhat subtle      which are not being adequately met by legislative appropriations student      tuition and fees Any of these include            The Student Lounge This area is usually the first seen by prospective      faculty and students Over twenty years of wear have left furniture and      other decor in a shabby state inconsistent with an impressive law school      Rehabilitation costs are estimated to be  No state dollars are      available for this project      Scholarships For  our school of law received  in      state funds and  from private endowment and gifts for a total of       for scholarship assistance This is only about  of the total      cost that law students paid for their legal education at the school last      year It is far less scholarship aid than is available at most law      schools      Last year for example the IU School of LawBloomington spent       for scholarships from private and public sources although their      student body is somewhat smaller than ours      Faculty Salaries and Research Support Our law school ranks last in      median base salaries for full professors when compared with salaries paid      to full professors at the eight other Big Ten law schools The school      also lacks sufficient funds to award adequate summer stipends to support      faculty scholarship and to cover the costs of student research      assistants      Library expenditures Again our law school ranks last in this      category when compared with the eight other Big Ten law schools      Annual Expenditures Highest Michigan  Average       LawIndianapolis       Your patience will not be tested by commentary on the General      Assemblys problems in providing more support for higher education      Rather these humble efforts will be directed to increasing private      sector contributions      One of the selling points in this falls development campaign is the      level of support given by the schools alumni leaders and friends on the      Alumni Association Board and the Board of Visitors Obviously if all      members of the two Boards were to pledge  per year we would be      most grateful and we would have a great story to tell However we      recognize that contributions at the Maennerchor Society level are not      possible for all Some Board members may have had their motherinlaw      move in another mouth to feed and a loss in domestic tranquility Junior      may have wrecked the car and daughter may have attained the age for      orthodontia If circumstances do not permit your participation in the      Maennerchor Society please do contribute at one of the levels recognized      annually by the school      Maennerchor Society  or more Deans Council         Barristers Club    Law School Associates         Contributions may be made when the pledge is submitted or anytime      prior to the end of  A pledge card and return envelope are enclosed      For the reasons noted below please return your card before August             If you have pledged or contributed for  you have my thanks and      the appreciation of the administration and faculty of the law school      Also you have the satisfaction of knowing that your colleagues are being      urged to emulate your good judgment      In early September it will be my privilege to personally contact any      members of the Board of Visitors or Alumni Board who through      misadventure oversight procrastination or the pendency of personal      bankruptcy proceedings have not made some pledge or contribution however      large or small to our school      As I consider the talented loyal and resourceful leaders on these      Boards I assume few if any calls will be necessary      One last matter we will be contacting alumni for membership in the      Maennerchor Society in October and November If you are willing to make a      few six or less telephone calls to assist the law school please so      indicate on your pledge card Those participating will be provided      prospects names addresses and telephone numbers as well as background      information on the schools needs      Thanks for your courtesy in reviewing this epistle and for your      response      Sincerely      John M Holt
