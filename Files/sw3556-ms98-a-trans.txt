        okay Jerry the uh topic was favorite TV shows and       what kind are you interested in and how they and do they differ from like mine   umhum umhum well okay uh most of most of the uh commercial television these days im just a little bit sick of       uh in fact i dont watch hardly any uh television at all with uh my other activities uh between my family and my church et cetera et cetera why i dont have any time uh hardly any time to sit down and watch the news now i do watch the Discovery Channel and some on channel thirteen but aside from   right oh do you yeah   aside from that i pretty well uh turn it off   oh im sort of a well im different from that im sort of a a movie buff i go to a  a couple of movies movies a week sometimes quite honestly im im selfemployed and a lot of times i will uh go out and take   umhum   a lunch hour and go to lunch from like twelve to two and go to a movie and just come back to my office   i dont blame you   but uh i do it its like entertainment im pretty much of a a junk movie watcher by myself if i take my wife then we see something a little nicer you know   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   but uh and my kids are all sort of movie watchers you know weve weve always been to a lot of weve always gone to a lot of movies in our life so but i would just as soon uh be doing something else its just that my kids are gone now and and my wifes a school teacher and sometimes  she doesnt get home until about seven oclock so you know ill come in like five thirty or six and ill turn on the tube and   uhhuh   set there and have my coffee or Coke or whatever and a little TV and sometimes i set there all evening   yeah i i well if sometimes if if its real good like theres more than been theres been more than one evening that ive uh caught uh every animal show that evening on uh on the Discover Channel   you bet you bet   and uh because theyre uh theyre theyre you you know theyre documentaries and theyre   well thats an interesting channel   oh you bet in fact im glad that its part of our ah basic cable package   well thats great you know ive ive just never spent any time watching it and you know   but uh uhhuh   i like my sports and everything but i   oh well me too hello with the     i watched my Dallas Cowboys i watched them to halftime before i left and i left at halftime and started drinking driving   well they they whooped they whooped up on them   they sure did they just did an excellent job   uhhuh and theyre in the playoffs and uh im not sure that the Eagles are or not   yeah the Eagles you have to laugh the luck into it now i think but the Cowboys they earned it on their own merit   i did yeah thats true   well   and you know everybody or not everybody but quite a few of the folks were kind of down on Mister Johnson but uh hes uh hes brought the pokes uh from a a one and something team to a playoffs in what three years now   you you bet as much as everyone you know and use the word love Tom Landry you know im glad that Jimmy Johnsons there   uhhuh well its uh you know it was a time for the passing of the guard i mean and i think Tom knew it   it was i think so too he wanted to go out a winner though i think he wouldve stayed there four or five more years so he could have gone out a winner   so um yeah thats true and i wouldnt i wouldnt have blamed him one bit because   no no its you know he earned those stripes   yeah but see nobody remembers him as a loser   i know   because hes too hes too far hes far too much of a gentleman and a and a practicing Christian to uh to ever be thought of as anything but a loser you know but a winner   oh yes you bet hes a hes a winner in anyones book and i hope hes a winner in his own book you know because that thats the key there   yeah oh he is he is because he has to like himself before he can like other people   you bet   uh   little things that disturb me and i know hes being a little hardnosed about it but uh you know this ring of honor thing you know he needs to be there   umhum   because hes earned it he deserves it and he was the Dallas Cowboys and he wont do that yet so i hope he makes up his mind to do it because   yes oh he will   he needs to be remembered   right well nobodys gonna forget Tom Landry shoot come now i mean im not a   no no no absolutely absolutely not oh thats true but he needs to be honored put it that way   betcha im im not a native Texan by birth but uh i guess by uh length of length of time ive been the state now is what after youre here twenty years youre considered a native   you bet ive been here since seventy four um and i feel like a native   well lets see i came down March of sixty nine went to work for T and I yeah   oh did you yeah   so uh i havent looked back yet either so   yeah
