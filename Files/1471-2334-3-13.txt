                    Background                  Testing the hypothesis          We can test this hypothesis by           Identifying genes likely to have been transferred          directly or indirectly to           E coli OH from archaea           Investigating the distribution of similar genes in          pathogens and nonpathogens and performing rigorous          phylogenetic analyses on putative transfers                          Have any transfers been described between archaea          and E coliO          I have demonstrated that a gene coding for a          bifunctional catalaseperoxidase is likely a transfer          from archaea to a variety of pathogenic bacteria          including           E coli OH     Although          not yet directly implicated in OH as a virulence          factor this enzyme has been implicated as a virulence          factor in           Mycobacterium tuberculosis               and in           Legionella pneumophila              Furthermore this           E coli OH catalaseperoxidase          has been associated with enterohaemorrhagic hemolysin in          a variety of shigalike toxinproducing          verotoxinproducing           E coli      This          correlation of the presence of the catalaseperoxidase in          many virulent but not in avirulent strains suggests a          direct role in the virulence of enterohemorrhagic           E coli                           How can we identify other genes likely to have been          transferred directly or indirectly to E coliOH          from archaea          We can use the three complete           E coli genomes available               to identify a subset of genes present in one or both          of the O strains but not in K This subset of genes           although most have not been directly identified as          virulence genes  are more likely to be          virulenceassociated This subset will be the focus of          our search for genes likely to have laterally transferred          from archaea Perna           et al    identified  genes          in the EDL O strain they sequenced that are          Ospecific This number does not include the          Ospecific plasmids that were previously sequenced             from which some of the preliminary work             described below was derived          As a preliminary step to testing this hypothesis I          have searched the           E coli OH strain EDL             genome for open reading frames ORFs meeting the          following criteria           present in O strain EDL but not in           E coli K           highly similar having a BLASTP similarity bit          score   to ORFs found in at least two archaeal          genomes           having few or no highly similar proteins BLASTP          score   in other bacterial genomes          This search was facilitated by the Clusters of          Orthologous Groups COG database at NCBI               This preliminary nonsystematic search produced  ORFS          worth considering as LGTs from archaea to pathogenic          bacteria Table shows these ORFs with their location          and if any information was available a possible          function          Although the putative functions in Table are not          generally associated with virulence many genes under          the right circumstances can facilitate infection or          contribute to pathogenicity There are examples in the          literature where both ABC transporters in           Streptococcus gordonii               and helicase genes in           Legionella pneumophila               have been directly implicated in virulence          Further testing of this hypothesis will require          rigorous phylogenetic analyses of each suspected          transfer The procedure of comparing similarity scores to          identify potential lateral transfers used above          although commonly employed      it is fraught with          potential errors           and must          serve only as an initial screen Ragan    recently          wrote                      This study demonstrates the need for            a systematic comprehensive approach to the study of            LGT based on first principles ie rigorous inference            and statistically based comparison of molecular            phylogenetic trees As more genomic sequences appear a            treebased approach will become both more challenging            and more rewarding                                     Implications of the hypothesis          Although this hypothesis focuses on archaea and           E coli  the model of distant gene          transfer as a major contributor of new virulence genes          to pathogens or potential pathogens has broad          applicability to a large number of pathogenic systems          Archaea represent both the most distant source and in          many ways the most unlikely source for virulence genes          If           E coli can acquire virulence genes          from archaea then potentially any organism is a          reservoir of virulence genes for pathogens             The implications should this hypothesis be proven          are myriad Our understanding of potential sources of          virulence genes will be expanded to include virtually all          life on earth  at first glance a frightening prospect          At the same time however it would allow us to move from          a descriptive reactionary view of infectious disease          towards a predictive science of infectious disease It          would be dramatic evidence of what some microbiologists          suspect that lateral gene transfer is the predominant          engine of variation in prokaryotes and the catalyst for          the emergence of new bacterial pathogens                            Competing interests        None declared
