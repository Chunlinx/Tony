                                  Got Osteoporosis            It will be hard to frolic through the nextmillennium with bones that have turned to sawdust That is the fate that awaitsthose of us we are told who dont consume the escalating amount ofcalciumnow at a quart of milk a day or the equivalentendorsed by publichealth officials Just two years ago the National Academy of Sciences increasedits daily recommendation for calcium by  percent for older Americans Anotherupward revision and we will all have to be attached to udders with an IVStrange then that most of the worlds people who rarely if ever drink milkand who get just a small percentage of the calcium we are told is vital havenot devolved into boneless heaps of protoplasm Even stranger in many of thesedairyavoiding countries people get through life with far fewer of theagerelated hip fractures that plague Americans            This paradox has led a small number of researchersto become dairy doubters questioning the wisdom of the calcium recommendationsof the public health establishment For one thing the doubters say our dietis so fundamentally flawed that trying to protect our bones by taking in loadsof calcium is like trying to fill a tub with no stopper by turning up thefaucets The problem is this In general world dietary patterns show thatcountries where people consume large amounts of calcium are also countrieswhere people eat extravagant amounts of animal protein places such as theUnited States and northern Europe These countries also suffer among theworlds highest rate of fractures due to osteoporosis the diseasecharacterized by weak porous bones The correlation between animal proteinintake and fracture rates in different societies is as strong as that betweenlung cancer and smoking says T Colin Campbell professor of nutritionalbiochemistry at Cornell University            Our bodies contain pounds to  pounds of calcium  percent of which is in our bones and teeththe rest circulates in the blood where it is necessary for nervoussystemfunction Eating animal protein which is high in sulfurcontaining aminoacids requires the body to buffer the effects of those amino acids It does soby releasing calcium from the bones literally peeing them away But thisleaching of calcium should be offset if the balance of calcium to protein inthe diet is within a reasonable range Robert Heaney professor of medicine atthe Creighton University School of Medicine and a proponent of high dairyconsumption found in a study he coauthored that the single most importantdeterminate of the rate of bone gain in young women was not the amount ofcalcium consumed but the ratio of calcium to protein But its a difficultbalance to strike when its common for Americans to eat double the protein weneed with  percent of it coming from animal sources            Could there be some other dietary factor at work as wellRetired Harvard professor of nutrition Mark Hegsted thinks there may be Hebelieves calcium consumption may be at the root of our bone problems but hisheretical hypothesis is not that we dont get enough calcium but rather that weget too much In an article in the Journal of Nutrition he writesHip fractures are more frequent in populations where dairy products arecommonly consumed and calcium intakes are relatively high Is there anypossibility that this is a causal relationship            Hegsted explains the waysuch a mechanism would work The body adapts to low calcium intake byefficiently using what is available Conversely high calcium consumptioncauses the body to decrease the amount of the mineral that is absorbedexcreting the excess Thats why populations with low calcium consumptionmanage to form healthy skeletons and high calcium consumers dont developbones like mastodons But what happens over time Hegsted suggests is that theinefficient consumers may permanently damage their abilities to effectively usedietary calcium and to conserve calcium in the bones later in life As we agethe body naturally goes from building bone to losing it Hegsteds hypothesisexplains why high dairy consumers so often end up with rampant bone loss Hecites studies of rural Gambian women who dont drink milk get aboutonequarter of the calcium were told to consume yet rarely have osteoporoticfractures It will be embarrassing enough if the current calcium hype issimply useless it will be immeasurably worse if the recommendations areactually detrimental to health he writes            Cornells Campbell says our fate could be different if wewould take a lesson from the Chinese fortunately hes a nutritionist not apolitical scientist He has spent the last  years studying the health anddietary habits of rural Chinese and comparing them to those in the West TheseChinese consume less than half the calcium were told is necessary virtuallyall of it from plant sources in particular leafy green vegetables They haveonefifth the incidence of hip fracture of Americans Although they consumemore calories per day than we do only about  percent of their diet is fromanimal sources On average American diets are  percent animalbased            Campbell has what couldbe called the unified field theory of bones and breasts He explains the mortalconsequences of diets high in dairy protein and fat Early in life Americangirls consume lots of these which leads to relatively dense bones high levelsof estrogen and early sexual maturation The age of menarche has been droppingfor decades in this country and now often occurs as early as age  In ruralChina girls dont usually begin menstruation until age  Chinese women haveonly about twothirds of the amount of circulating estrogen that American womendo which helps account for their far lower rate of breast cancer saysCampbell            Estrogen helps maintain bone so most womens skeletons arefine until menopause Then estrogen levels drop in the case of American womenfaster and lower than their Chinese counterparts Now theyre vulnerablesays Campbell That all suggests that the factors that cause osteoporosis arerather similar to the ones that cause breast cancer            Two very different sets of studies support histheory One compares bone density of Japanese and British women The Japaneseget almost all their calcium from soy the bones of small cooked fish andvegetables They also have about  percent the rate of hip fracture of theWest The British diet is similar to ours and so is their hip fracture rateBefore menopause the British women do indeed have denser bones than theJapanese But following menopause the British women end up losing more bonethan the Japanese And a spate of recent studies in this country has found thatwomen with the highest measured bone density a muchdesired goal according tothe literature on osteoporosis have a significantly increased incidence ofbreast cancer            Campbell says views suchas his are not more widely known because Unfortunately we are absolutelydrowned in information coming out of the dairy industry  Our nationalnutrition policies are corrupted by the influence of the dairy industry            The milk proponents offer a variety of responses as to whyosteoporosis is far less common in the nonmilkdrinking world One is that thetheories of the doubters could be characterized as demented ravings probablyinduced by dairy deficiency Another boils down to Were Americans If wewere rural Chinese or Gambians sure wed be eating primarily beans andvegetables so thank goodness we arent The public health officials versionof the line Take my wife please is Tell Americans to eat kale five timesa week            The milk advocatesrightly point out that physical activity particularly the kind that requiresweightbearing is crucial to bone growth and maintenance For example whilewe have turned our bathrooms into palaces of comfort lots of the worldspeople still squat over holes which makes it difficult to finish reading thebusiness section but is a real bone builder Another theory holds that Asianwomen in particular have better designed hips than Caucasians making them likeinflatable punching toys that cant be knocked down thus less likely to sufferhip fractures The problem with this theory is that recent studies show thatthe Chinese diet is rapidly becoming more Westernized Guess what so is theChinese rate of osteoporosis            But most of all they say forget population statistics andinstead look at the laboratory Indeed there are dozens of clinicalexperiments showing that high doses of calcium either arrest bone loss or evenbuild bone in older women Fine say the dairy doubters if calcium is theanswer then it should both prevent and cure osteoporosis but it doesnt Thedoubters also argue that these laboratory studies which usually run from twoto four years may just be seeing a shortterm effect That is there is someinitial bonebuilding response by the body to large calcium doses but it maybe a temporary and unsustainable change            Which camp is right hasenormous public health consequences Eight million American women and  millionmen have osteoporosis The disease is responsible for more than  millionfractures annually with a direct cost of  billion Of those  arehip fractures onethird of the people over age  who break their hips neverwalk independently again and  percent die within a year from relatedcomplications With an aging population and in the absence of some plumbingapocalypse that will cause Americans to adopt a squatting posture to relievethemselves the incidence and cost of osteoporosis can only rise            In a way Americans are voting with their stomachs on themilk issue and unintentionally siding with the dairy opponents Milkconsumption has been falling for decades It is now about half what it was in Other beverages have displaced itin the case of young peopleespecially soft drinks Soft drinks are loaded with phosphorus which is anessential and widely available nutrient The problem is that too muchphosphorus itself causes calcium to be lost from the bones Then theres excesssalt another component of the average diet and a bonekiller as well            The battle between the vegetable advocates anddairy advocates over the nutritional choices of Americans is like symphonyorchestras dueling with opera companies over the entertainment dollars ofteenagers While theyre fighting they forgot to notice the audience is atAmerican Pie  So it turns out that no matter who is right the calciumdoubters or the calcium advocates that shattering sound you will hear as the st century progresses will be Americas bones
