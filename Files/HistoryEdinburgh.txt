                      A Brief History        The city of Edinburgh grew up around the steep ragged cliff        of the Castle Rock and its easily defended summit Archaeological        excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as         bc Very little however is known about the Rock and its        inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time        of the MacAlpin kings A few shadowy details have been left to us by        the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century        Romans and Britons        The Romans invaded Scotland in ad  where they met a        fierce group called the Picts whom they drove north They consolidated        their gains by building Antonines Wall across the waist of Scotland        between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about ad         Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock        and Arthurs Seat held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the        Votadini Little is recorded about this group but they were probably        the ancestors of the Gododdin whose feats are told in a        seventhcentury Old Welsh manuscript The capital of the Gododdin was        Din Eidyn the Fort of Eidyn almost certainly the Castle Rock        whose name lives on in the Edin of Edinburgh Din Eidyn fell to the        Angles in  and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria It        was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands        between the kingdoms of the north and the south        The MacAlpin Kings        Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as        Scotland the Picts in the north the Britons in the southwest the        invading Angles in the southeast and the Scots in the west The Scots        were Gaelicspeaking immigrants from the north of Ireland Kenneth        MacAlpin who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd acquired the Pictish        throne in  uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single        kingdom He moved his capitalalong with the Stone of Destiny on        which Scottish kings were crownedto the sacred Pict site of Scone        close to Perth His greatgreatgreatgrandson Malcolm II         defeated the Angles at the Battle of Carham in  and extended        Scottish territory as far south as the River Tweed These new lands        included the stronghold of Edinburgh        Malcolm IIs own grandson Malcolm Canmore         often visited Edinburgh with his wife Margaret a Saxon princess They        crossed the Forth from Dunfermline at the narrows known to this day as        Queensferry Margaret was a deeply pious woman who was subsequently        canonized and her youngest son David I  founded a church        in her name on the highest point of the Castle Rock St Margarets        Chapel David also founded the Abbey of Holyrood and created several        royal burghs towns with special trading privileges including        Edinburgh and Canongate the latter was under the jurisdiction of the        monks or canons of Holyrood        At this time Edinburgh was still a very modest town but        Davids successor Malcolm IV  made its castle his main        residence By the end of the th century Edinburghs castle was used        as a royal treasury The towns High Street stretched beneath the        castle along the ridge to the east today the Royal Mile past the        parish church of St Giles and out to the Netherbow where Edinburgh        ended and Canongate began        Wars of Independence        In  the MacAlpin dynasty ended leaving Scotland        without a ruler There were a number of claimants to the throne among        them John Balliol Lord of Galloway and Robert de Brus Lord of        Annandale The guardians of Scotland were unable to decide who should        succeed and asked the English king Edward I to adjudicate Edward        seeing this invitation as a chance to assert his claim as overlord of        Scotland chose John Balliol whom he judged to be the weaker of the        two        Edward treated King John as a vassal However when Edward        went to war with France in  and summoned John along with other        knights the Scottish king decided he had had enough He ignored        Edwards summons and instead negotiated a treaty with the French king        the beginning of a long association between France and Scotland that        became known as the Auld Alliance         Edward was furious and his reprisal was swift and bloody        In  he led a force of nearly  men into Scotland and captured        the castles of Roxburgh Edinburgh and Stirling The Stone of Destiny        and the Scottish crown jewels were stolen and Scotlands Great Seal        was broken up Oaths of fealty were demanded from Scottish nobles        while English officials were installed to oversee the running of the        country Scotland became little more than an English county        But the Scots did not take this insult lying down Bands of        rebels such as those led by William Wallace began to attack the        English garrisons and make raids into English territory When Wallace        was captured the Scots looked for a new leader and discovered one in        Robert the Bruce grandson of the Robert de Brus rejected by Edward in         He was crowned King of Scots at Scone in  and began his        campaign to drive the English out of Scotland        Edward I died in  and was succeeded by his ineffectual        son Edward II who in  led an army of some  men to confront        Bruces army at Bannockburn near Stirling Though outnumbered the        Scots gained a famous victory and sent the English packing Robert the        Bruce continued to harass the English until they were forced to sue for        peace A truce was declared and the Treaty of Northampton was        negotiated at Edinburgh in         Two of the recurring themes of Scottish history are minors        inheriting the throne and divided loyalties Although many Scottish        nobles were dedicated to the cause of independence others either bore        grudges against the ruling king or held lands in England that they        feared to lose These divisionslater hardened by religious        schismwould forever deny Scotland a truly united voice        When Robert the Bruce died in  his son and heir David        II was only five years old Within a few years the wars with England        resumed aggravated by civil war at home as Edward Balliol son of        John tried to take the Scottish throne with the help of the English        king Edward III        The Stewart Dynasty        During these stormy years the castle of Edinburgh was        occupied several times by English garrisons In  it was taken from        the English by William of Douglas The young David II returned from        exile in France and made it his principal royal residence building a        tower house Davids Tower on the site of what is now the Half Moon        Battery He died in  and was succeeded by his nephew Robert II        Davids sister Marjory had married Walter the Steward and their son        was the first of the long line of Stewart later spelled Stuart        monarchs who would reign over Scotlandand subsequently Great        Britainuntil the Glorious Revolution of         The strength and wealth of Scotland increased during the        reigns of the first Stewart kings New castles were built and new        weapons acquired including the famous gun called Mons Meg        Edinburgh emerged as Scotlands main political center and was declared        by James III  to be the principal burgh of our kingdom        James IV  confirmed Edinburghs status as the        capital of Scotland by constructing a royal palace at Holyrood He        cemented a peace treaty with England by marrying Margaret Tudor the        daughter of Henry VIIthe socalled Marriage of the Thistle and the        Rosebut this did not prevent him from making a raid into England in         The attack culminated in the disastrous Battle of Flodden near        the River Tweed and the king was killed Fearing invasion the        Edinburgh town council built a protective wall the Flodden Wall        around the city boundaries        Yet again a minorthe infant James Vsucceeded to the        throne and Scots nobles were divided as to whether Scotland should        draw closer to England or seek help from her old ally France The        adult James leaned toward France and in  took a French wife Mary        of Guise She bore two sons who both died in infancy but by the time        she was about to give birth to their third child her husband lay dying        at Falkland Palace On  December  a messenger arrived with news        that the queen had produced a daughter at the palace of Linlithgow A        few days later the king was dead leaving a weekold baby girl to        inherit the Scottish crown        Mary Queen of Scots        The baby was Mary Stuart who at the age of nine months was        crowned Queen of Scots at the Chapel Royal Stirling When the news        reached London Henry VIII saw his chance to subdue Scotland again and        negotiated a marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward The        Scots refused and Henry sent an army rampaging through Scotland on a        campaign known as the Rough Wooing  The English king ordered his        general to burn Edinburgh town so there may remain forever a perpetual        memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon the Scots         But more was at stake than simply Scotlands independence        there was now a religious schism within Britain In order to divorce        Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn Henry VIII had broken with        Rome and brought the English church under his own control England was        thus now a Protestant country caught between Catholic France and the        Scots with their new Catholic queen        The Scots themselves were divided many embracing        Protestantism in the spirit of the Reformation while others remained        staunchly Catholic However fear of the rampaging English army led the        Scots again to seek help from their old allies in France and the young        queen married the Dauphin Franois son of the French king        Franois II became king of France in  but died soon        after In  the yearold Mary returned to a Scotland in the grip        of the Reformation as Protestant leaders had taken control of the        Scottish parliament and abolished the authority of the pope Her        Protestant cousin Elizabeth Tudor was on the English throne but        Elizabeththe Virgin Queenhad no heir Mary was next in line for        the English crown and Elizabeth was suspicious of her intentions        The six years of Marys reign were turbulent ones She        clashed early on with Edinburghs famous Protestant reformer John        Knox who held sway in St Giles but later adopted an uneasy policy of        religious tolerance In  she married her young cousin Henry Lord        Darnley much to the chagrin of Elizabeth Darnley was a grandson of        Margaret Tudor and thus also had a claim to the English throne On         June  in the royal apartments in Edinburgh Castle Mary gave birth        to a son Prince James        Within a year however Darnley was murdered and Mary        immediately immersed herself in controversy by marrying the Earl of        Bothwell the chief suspect Mary was forcedto abdicate in  and        the infant prince was crowned as James VI        Mary sought asylum in England only to be imprisoned by        Elizabeth The English queen kept her cousin in captivity for  years        and finally had her beheaded on a trumpedup charge of treason So it        was bitterly ironic when Elizabeth died without an heir and James        Marys Catholic son inherited the English throne        In  James VI of Scotland was thus crowned James I of        England marking the Union of the Crowns Although Scotland was still a        separate kingdom the two countries would from that day be ruled by the        same monarch        The Covenanters        Edinburghs population grew fast between  and  and        a maze of tall unsanitary tenements sprouted along the spine of the        High Street The castle was extended and in  the Towns College        the precursor of the University of Edinburgh was founded James died        in  succeeded by his son Charles I who proved an incompetent        ruler In  his attempt to force the Scottish Presbyterian Church to        accept an English liturgy and the rule of bishops led to civil revolt        and rioting        The next year a large group of Scottish churchmen and        nobles signed the National Covenant a declaration condemning the new        liturgy and pledging allegiance to the Presbyterian faith The        Covenanters as they were called at first sided with Oliver Cromwells        Parliamentarians in the civil war that had erupted across the border        But when the English revolutionaries beheaded Charles I in  the        Scots rallied round his son Charles II Cromwells forces then invaded        Scotland crushed the Covenanter army and went on to take Edinburgh        Scotland suffered ten years of military rule under Cromwells        Commonwealth        Scotlands troubles continued after Charles IIs        restoration to the throne in  The Covenanters faced severe        persecution at the hands of the kings supporters who had decided to        follow his fathers policy of imposing bishops on the Scots Hundreds        of Covenanters were imprisoned and executed        In the end England underwent the Glorious Revolution of         when Catholic James II Scotlands James VII was deposed and the        Protestant William of Orange  took the British crown        Presbyterianism was established as Scotlands official state church and        the Covenanters prevailed        Act of Union        On  May  England and Scotland were formally joined        together by the Act of Unionestablishing the Union of        Parliamentsand the United Kingdom was born Despite the fact that        Scotland was allowed to retain its own legal system education system        and national Presbyterian Church the move was opposed by the great        majority of Scots The supporters of the deposed James VII and his        successors exiled in France were known as the Jacobites  Several        times during the next  years they attempted to restore the Stuart        dynasty to the British throne though by this time the crown had passed        to the German House of Hanover        James Edward Stuart known as the Old Pretender traveled        up the Firth of Forth in  but was driven back by British ships and        bad weather Another campaign was held in  under the Jacobite Earl        of Mar but it was the  rising of Prince Charles Edward Stuart the        Young Pretender which became the stuff of legend        The prince known as Bonnie Prince Charlie the grandson of        James VII raised an army of Jacobite highlanders and swept through        Scotland They occupied Edinburgh but not the castle and defeated a        government army at the Battle of Prestonpans In November of that year        he invaded England capturing Carlisle and driving south as far as        Derby only  km  miles short of London        Finding his forces outnumbered and overextended here the        young prince beat a tactical retreat but the English army hounded him        relentlessly The final showdownat Culloden in saw the        Jacobite army slaughtered Prince Charlie fled and was pursued over the        Highlands before escaping in a French ship He died in Rome in         disillusioned and drunk        The Scottish Enlightenment        The Jacobite uprisings found little support in such lowland        cities as Edinburgh Here there was a growing sense that the Union was        around to stay Within ten years of the Young Pretenders occupation of        Holyrood Edinburghs town council proposed a plan to relieve the        chronic overcrowding of the Royal Mile tenements by constructing a New        Town on land to the north of the castle In  a design by a young        and previously unknown architect James Craig was approved and work        began        This architectural renaissance in Edinburgh was followed by        an intellectual flowering in the sciences philosophy and medicine        that revolutionized Western society in the late th century and saw        the city dubbed the Athens of the North  Famous Edinburgh residents        of this periodlater known as the Scottish Enlightenmentincluded        David Hume author of A Treatise of Human Nature and one of Britains        greatest philosophers Adam Smith author of The Wealth of Nations a        pioneer in the study of political economy and Joseph Black the        scientist who discovered the concept of latent heat Robert Burnss        poems and Walter Scotts novels rekindled interest in Scotlands        history and nationhood Scott especially worked hard to raise        Scotlands profile        The Modern City        In the th century Edinburgh was swept up in the        Industrial Revolution The coalfields of Lothian and Fife fueled the        growth of baking distilling printing and machinemaking industries        giving Edinburgh the epithet Auld Reekie Old Smoky With the        arrival of the railways in the mids the city grew almost        exponentially as new lines led to the spread of Victorian suburbs such        as Marchmont and Morningside        During the th century Edinburgh became a European center        of learning and culture The University of Edinburgh has made        outstanding contributions to various fields The Edinburgh        International Festival held annually since  is acknowledged as        one of the worlds most important arts festivals In addition the        citys rich history and architecture have made it one of the most        popular tourist destinations in the United Kingdom        Nationalism never completely disappeared however and in        the latter part of the century there has been a concerted though        peaceful effort to gain selfdetermination for Scotland In  the        nationalists were in disarray when a referendum was defeated and        further efforts came to nought during Conservative rule in the British        Parliament at Westminster through the s and early s But the        Stone of Destiny was returned to Scottish soil in  years        after it had been taken south by the English        The general election of May  proved to be a turning        point The British Labour Party supported the return of domestic        policymaking power to Scotland When it was victorious at the ballot        box among the new governments first tasks was to organize a        referendum on Scottish devolution This took place in September         with the majority supporting the creation of a Scottish Parliament        although many strident nationalists thought the proposals did not go        far enough The Scotland Bill was put before the British Parliament in        January  and became law as the Scotland Act in November         Political power thus returned to Edinburgh after nearly         years Elections were held in May  and the new Parliament opened        on the first of July The city now buzzes with energy and confidence as        MPs and policy makers gather to make plans for the future of the        Scottish people
