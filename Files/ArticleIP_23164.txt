                                 A Racist STRONGEMSlateEMSTRONG            OnMarch  the House of Representatives debated a proposed resolution condemningthe Council of Conservative Citizens a racist group that Senate MajorityLeader Trent Lott has come under fire for addressing Rep JC Watts Jr ofOklahoma preempted consideration of the bill by introducing an alternativeresolution denouncing all forms of racism and bigotry without mentioning theCCC specifically After Reps Charles Canaday of Florida and John Coyners ofMichigan criticized the Watts substitute which failed to get the twothirdsvote required for passage Watts answered them from the floor                            I wouldjust say to my friend the gentleman from Florida that it is an amazing thingto me that over the last  years when I have been attacked when I have hadracist comments made about me my friend from Florida never came to the floorand spoke up The gentleman from Michigan when I have had racist attacks madeagainst me by people in the white community back in Oklahoma the StateDemocrat Party back in Oklahoma                      Slate                   magazinewhich is a national magazine no one ran to the floor to condemnthat                        Bruce Gottlieb of ourRedmond office called Rep Watts office to ask what he thought                  Slate                had done that constituted a racist attackWattss press secretary Pam Pryor pointed to a Strange Bedfellow column thatI wrote in May  titled The Football Caucus Gottlieb then forwarded thearticle by email and asked what in it Watts found racist                           From  PamPryor                           Sent Thursday March    PM                           To  Bruce Gottlieb            Bruce the part in the story that says But despitehis goalong getalong  through if he werent black is the part we findoffensive in particular Doubtful you would have said that about a BlackDemocrat            And if you did manyvoices would have risen against you             I then replied                           FromJacob Weisberg                           SentFriday March    PM                           To Pam Pryor            DearMs Pryor            I can understand how Rep Watts might be annoyed bymy article and how any number of people might disagree with it for a varietyof reasons But on what basis did he go onto the floor of the House and call                  Slate                and by implication me racist            You cite this passage But despite his goalonggetalong affability Watts is unlikely to accomplish much in the House Theproblem is that Watts would never be given a leading role in his party if hewerent black            I can only guess at what Rep Watts might havefound offensive here The phrase goalong to getalong has no racialimplication that Im aware of Its a standard description of party loyaltyapplied most often in my experience to white Democrats            Next we come to the phrase unlikely to toaccomplish much in the House This is my prediction based on my assessment ofRep Watts record thus far and my opinion of his abilities I might be wrongin this forecast But either way its got nothing to do with the fact thathes black Indeed I say nearly the same thing about Rep Largent elsewhere inthe same article            The final sentence in the passage you cite contendsthat Rep Watts has been elevated within the Republican Party in part becauseof his race In other words I think that affirmative action has played a rolein Rep Watts rapid ascent within GOP Do you actually dispute this Would youseriously maintain that Rep Watts would have been chosen to give theRepublican response to President Clinton immediately after the  electionand to speak at the San Diego Convention in to name only a few of hishonors and distinctionsif he happened to be white But again whether or notIm correct in my analysis theres nothing racist about arguing that a memberof a minority groupwhether a Democrat or a Republicanhas benefited from adesire for diversity            Supportive of the party line  not especiallycapable  beneficiary of affirmative action I most certainly would say anyof these things about a black Democrat to whom they applied In fact I did saythem in a column about Alexis Herman a few months earlier No one accused me ofbigotry And if someone had I would have been just as offended as I amnow            Unless Im missingsomething here I really think Rep Watts owes                   Slate               and me an apology            Yourssincerely            JacobWeisberg            To date we have received no answer from Rep Wattsor his office s a link to my original article Readers can make up their ownminds about whether it constitutes a racist attack
