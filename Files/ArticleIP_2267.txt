                                 The Spinmaster Aptitude Test            Contrary to popular beliefthe Clinton administration did not invent spin But the Clintonites haveproduced an extraordinary amount of it This is partly because they have a lotto spin about and partly because they just seem to like spinning            Latelythe outpouring has been especially torrential In addition to the spin comingfrom the president The Lincoln Bedroom was never sold and the vicepresident There is no controlling legal authority there has been a steadygush from administration spokespersons Mike McCurry Ann Lewis and Lanny Davisat daily White House briefings and on television Judged in terms of howeffective it is at defusing the fundraising scandal this PR work ranges fromcatastrophically bad to fairly good What is odd is that the Clintonadministration spinhappy as it is doesnt seem to have any sense of whichkinds of spin are effective and which only make matters worse            To get a taste of the different styles I put some genericscandal questions to various administration flacks Ann Lewis the deputydirector of communications was the first one I reached I asked Lewis toexplain why Gores fundraising calls from the White House did not violate thelaw prohibiting the solicitation of funds on government premises She said onlythe White House counsels office could discuss legal issues so I asked on amore general note whether Gore was in any trouble Obviously I dont thinkhes in trouble she said Why not Well I think what we have so farlearned what the Washington Post seems to have learned to their greatastonishment is that candidates for reelection would actually campaign ontheir own behalf A Democratic candidate in at a time when Congress wasshutting down the government repealing the ban on assault weapons and tryingto shut down the Department of Educationwould have taken seriously the issuesthat were at stake Shocking That was all Lewis had time for            My nextcall was to Amy Weiss Tobe the spokeswoman for the Democratic NationalCommittee I pressed her on a different issuethe White House sleepovers Iaccepted I said the administrations position that there was no price onstaying in the Lincoln Bedroom But wasnt the Lincoln Bedroom one of the toolsClinton used to help raise money for the  election as Clintonshandwritten Ready to start overnights right away note clearly indicatesThere was no link Tobe said The president can invite whomever he choosesto stay over He invited friends and supporters and others There was no ticketprice Understood I said but werent sleepovers used as a fundraising toolI dont believe so she said Again there was no price on it After athird try I gave up trying to get her to admit the obvious            Finally I reached Mike McCurry the WhiteHouse press secretary When I asked why Gore hadnt broken the law McCurrydirected me to a story in that days New York Times  which suggestedthat Gore might have broken the letter but not the spirit of the law If youlook at the history of the law it was intended to make it impossible forfederal officials to extract payments from federal workers he said On theblanket prohibition against raising money on federal property McCurrysuggested that it couldnt sensibly apply to the president and vice presidentwho actually live on federal property But he added this issue has not beentested Next I tried the Lincoln Bedroom question Wasnt it used as afundraising tool Staying over at Clintons house was certainly a tool Iwouldnt dispute that McCurry said It was a tool Clinton enjoyed usingBush and Reagan he added used a variety of fundraising tools as well            Letslook a bit more closely at these approaches Asked a direct question Lewisimmediately changes the subject to some other issue like gun control Shenever gives so much as an inch in admitting wrongdoing At a news briefing Feb Lewis offered the following kerfuffle The president and Mrs Clintonenjoy spending time with their friends They regularly asked people to stay atthe White House  especially old friends and sometimes people they  metmore recently andheres the keywanted an opportunity to talk to  in apersonal and nonofficial setting when they could  And Ill also say havinggone over the list and having read through it this weekend I can now see whythe president and the first family are proud of the people who came to theWhite House as their personal guests Lewis went on to explain that one of theguests was an old friend who was dying of cancer This unctuous displayinfuriated members of the press corpsseveral told me they avoid talking toLewis One prominent national reporter describes Lewis style as commenting onthe rain outside by claiming that the sun is shining Because she is viewed asan apparatchik anything Lewis says is discounted  percent            Tobe and Lanny Davis the official scandal spokesman at theWhite Housewho never called me back are less spinhappy than Lewis Theywill not try to tell you that the Lincoln Bedroom sleepovers were really aboutold friends dying of cancer Rather they stick to an authorized scriptandwhen that fails they retreat into a fog of obscurantism At the Feb  WhiteHouse briefing Davis was asked whether access had been sold to contributorsOf course people coming to the White House have access to the president bydefinition because hes there But we regard the notion of special accessbecause a contribution is made as something that is contrary to our policiesHuh That evening on Nightline  Davis repeatedly told an incredulousTed Koppel that Clintons note about sleepovers was meant to refer to friendsand supporters Ted Im struck by how many people are looking at dotsconnecting them where theres no evidence to connect them The president hasclearly said that there was absolutely no requirement no price tag These werefriends and supporters of his coming to his residence This mirrored thelowspin style of Ron Ziegler Nixons spokesman during Watergate  Thepresident acknowledges that a wide variety of meteorological conditionsincluding precipitation are common this time of year You might call thatrain but we dont  It provokes a mixture of sadism and sympathy fromreporters who proceed to turn the hapless flack into a human punching bag            McCurry takes a differentapproach Rather than sticking to a line that is obviously absurd he admitsproblems He then goes into impressive detail about what the law is and how itmight or might not have been broken Having proved that he is a sentient humanbeing he subtly points his questioner in a different directionwerentpractices similar to this one actually common under previous presidentsMcCurrys model is John F Kennedy who would fully engage with reportersoccasionally deflect a question with humor and seldomif everget caughtout Is it raining outside Sure its raining  McCurry tells you Infact it has rained  inches todayaverage for the year             Only thelast of these approaches works But the Clintons who dislike and distrust thepress themselves seem not to have learned the obvious lesson Instead ofcredibility they have looked for the quality of ultimate loyalty in theirflacks The previous scandal spokesman was Mark Fabiani a McCurrystylespinner who was liked and trusted by reporters and who managed almostsinglehandedly to cure the FBIfile scandal with a dose of openness But theadministration replaced Fabiani with Davis whose main qualification was thathe had volunteered to defend the Clintons on Crossfire  It hired Lewisfor the same reasonshe devised the Dont Pillory Hillary campaign on herown As their relations with the press deteriorate to levels of hostility notseen since  the Clintons are failing once again to recognize that a lackof loyalty is not their biggest problem A lack of credibility is
