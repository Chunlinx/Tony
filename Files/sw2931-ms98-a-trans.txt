              okay so my children are twenty and twenty four and uh   oh   my son just moved uh to Arkansas so hes married so course uh uh when when theyre here when they lived here and i have a daughter whose twenty and we spend a lot of time together   uhhuh uhhuh   not so much as you know  were we both have everybodys busy but when my kids were younger i was a single parent and i spent most of my life with my children i did a did a lot things with the kids   oh yeah   but uh yeah its uh a i dont i i i one thing that happened is when when my son uh graduated from high school and he went off to college then it it drastically changed uh before prior to that we had sit down dinners and we talked and we did a whole lot of things and then when he left   uhhuh   uh my daughter and i just kind of said well lets just kind of do what do our own thing and uh   uhhuh   you know i i think that might i dont know i dont know you know its been so long since i had little children at home ill ill leave it up to you as to whats really going on these days   yeah well i first of all id i admire you for i have a few friends who are single parents and i just dont know how people do it   yeah   thats is a tremendous burden to be working and have two kids to take care of   uhhuh right   and i dont know how you did it but um i have a six year old thats well shes in first grade and then i have a three and a half year old and um i have always been a big advocate of spending tons of time with my kids and um when i my first one when she was born i had to work parttime for a while because we had to have the extra money but when the second one came along i was fortunate enough that i i quit and ive been able to stay home and um   oh so youre not working now great   no no i dont work yeah and so im one of those few oldfashioned moms  and we uh i spend the whole day with Tara and we go and do things and we read books and we play and you know its just its great and i did the same thing with Taylor uh whos my first grader shes also a girl and uh i think i think i can tell a real difference um Taylor has excelled in school like i just i never imagined she would shes at the top of her class in everything even though shes almost two year younger than almost all the kids in her class   hum   and i really feel like that um time i spent with her i mean she probably already had a lot uh of it in her but you know we spent a whole lot of time together reading books and doing a lot of things i think it helped her to feel real good about herself and feel like she could she could do it you know   yeah   so its its been real rewarding for me anyway   right but you know if uh uh i know now that i can look back and and i think about how much how much time i devoted to my children and and not necessarily but sacrificed a social life because i really did devote myself to my children basically i mean   oh im sure uhhuh   i mean i was i mean i did some things but i mean i really did but i have no regrets about that and i you know um   yeah uhhuh   and i can look back and it was so much fun being a kid with them and getting to do all the fun things that   uhhuh uhhuh   you know you get to do it that kids get to do and and that you wouldnt do by do you know with other adults   right   so its great fun i really envy you   yeah yeah   this is a wonderful time of your life   well it is you know as a matter of fact i think im real bad about looking ahead and thinking oh i dont ever want them to  grow up and you know go away to college and all that kind of thing but at least im really making the most of the time while theyre little and um everything Taylor even attempts to do you know we go and watch her and and support her and that was something my parents werent able to do and i resented that because i would be in i was always in plays in high school and in all kinds of drama and they could never come and watch me and that just it was so hard for me so i made a vow that when i had kids no matter what they did i was going to be there you know   umhum   and see them do it so it and like you said its fun i really enjoy it   well i can remember my my mom started working my parents  well course both of them worked but my mom started working when i i was third the last the youngest and she started working when i went to first grade and i can remember   uhhuh uhhuh   just a couple of few times that she would stay home and i i dont know if she was sick or just wanted to take the day off or what but   uhhuh   come home from school and you know every like youd tell that shed just mopped and she had you know food was cooking and the house smelled so good   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   uh i tell you what id take i dont know if children who maybe children who have that everyday dont dont dont appreciate it as much as you know   uhhuh   but uh it really was really was a special and i wished that she could have been home more it would have been greater because she was   yeah yeah   because she worked she was always kind of high strung and you know   uhhuh   didnt have the time to spend with us individually so   right yeah   i think its great if if uh if if you enjoy staying home with your kids while theyre young and and can do it   yeah yeah   thats great i wish i could stay home now   yeah i know well i feel i feel really thankful that i can i mean we have had to really lower our standard of living you know we have friends who have beautiful homes and we have a very small old house but i just to me thats not important because i feel like well have plenty of time to get us a nice house some day  and i wont have these you know these little kids all my life so   thats right   um i just i have been willing to make the sacrifices and my husband has too and so its not been a problem for us   well and and uh so you probably have a lot of friends who have small children do you do you find the the trend is uh   right   away from what youre doing or that theyre not spending that much time with them put them off with sitters and how about   well its interesting were real involved with a church group and so most of our friends are uh church friends   right   and theyre the majority of them do stay home uh almost all of my friends i can call any time of day and theyre home but um the friends the friends that ive kept in contact with from you know when i did work and theyre still working moms you know uh that   right   i feel like i real big uh difference in opinion with some of them because some of them work just because they enjoy working you know they they dont really have to work they just want to they like to get out and they dont want to be with their kids all day  and and thats hard for me because to me theyre giving up something so precious you know and um   yeah   so any time we talk get on that topic i have to be real careful because im afraid ill say something to offend them but um most of my friends do stay home so that its kind of nice we we have a big support group around here   well thats great   yeah it is i dont know how long everybody will be able to afford to keep doing it  but if   well   i guess you just get used to you know living however you have to live to   well i meant you know i meant if you dont ever have to go to work and you and youre youre happy you know even if your   yeah   uh kids all the way through high school and then it doesnt mean you have to go back to work   right yeah   so   yeah well i intend to uh i think when theyre both in school i may i have a degree to teach and um ive never used it because i was pregnant when i graduated from college and ive always had you know been home with kids or worked parttime but um i might go into like substitute teaching or something because   okay the hours are at least to be home you know   yeah yeah and i can choose they say as a substitute you can tell them the days that youre interested and you know the days youre not you dont have to so   that way uh maybe then then you can find out if youre really happy doing that if you want to do it full time later on   right yeah because i have a feeling im not going to like it  when i did my uh student teaching i oh i hated it   so thats good   i said i dont know why i majored in uh elementary education and here im about to graduate and i dont even like this   well maybe now that youve had your own children youll like to be around little children or have a little little better tolerance   yeah yeah yeah itll probably make a whole difference and plus i didnt feel well at the time i was pregnant and i was real sick and   thatd be tough yeah   yeah i and you just dont feel like being around all these little kids when you are just sick to your stomach       but anyway its been nice talking to you     nice talking to you and maybe ill talk to you again okay byebye   and uh thanks for calling bye bye
