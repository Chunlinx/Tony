          um regarding health care its funny because i have a sister who lives in Europe and in Europe thats the way it is health care is just   umhum they have socialized socialized health care   right exactly and um the the interesting thing is that it seems that they dont even think about it       its not anything that seems to be um you know costing everybody a lot of money its not a major topic of conversation its just something thats done and accepted   how do they pay for it how is it financed   well um i think the government subsidizes most of it but i i believe that that again just people are taxed   oh   a little bit more but its just interesting how something you know that we consider just such a major issue is just in such working order there   yeah   you know what do you feel about it   well i feel like something needs to be done here and im definitely in favor of the government i just think medical you know medical costs have as ive seen over the years just go up and up and up and already just this year   yes   you know im a single parent and you know i have to pay for medical insurance and its just outrageous my son you know has got allergies and hes got this and hes got that and he broke his arm i mean and you know its a thousand dollars here a thousand dollars there   umhum um umhum   and you know even though the insurance is paying eighty percent of it youre pay an arm and a leg for the insurance first of all and then youre still paying yeah the twenty percent and so   umhum the twenty percent and and the sad part is that people to to you know combat this they just wont go to the doctor or they wont fill their prescriptions   yeah or they cant yeah they just cant   i mean that you know thats the alternative   yeah ive been in positions before where ive had to wait a few days you know to have a prescription filled because i just didnt have it   umhum umhum   and i dont think that thats fair i dont think its fair you know to the kids and and to the people that are sick and i know that you know   i know umhum   every city has you know their you know their free hospitals or whatever and i know a few people that have had experiences in those   umhum   ive been fortunate enough not to but i mean you could go down there half dead and still wait you know its hard to see a doctor from what ive heard   oh i know i know oh yeah its true and i dont think that that burden should be put on companies either i dont think that they should have to assume the responsibility of paying for the persons health care   well yeah theres a lot of people that um you know dont work   oh yeah umhum   you know and dont have it you know any other means theyve and so they either dont again dont have it or they have to take it out themselves and pay an arm and a leg for it   umhum umhum   you know im thinking of you know i just did my tax return for the last year you know if your medical bills are more than a certain percent of your income   umhum umhum   you know its worthwhile to itemize and and last year i was the first year we reached that mark   umhum oh you did   where my medical where it was worth it to itemize for medical expenses because they were just they were that much of a percentage of my income that it just   wow umhum umhum   you know i just did it its very frustrating  a hot topic for me   i know well and well you know youre not the only one though um im in a situation where when i started my job they were paying full benefits i thought great you know cant get any better and then slowly each year you know now theyre down to seventy five percent and then they went down to fifty percent and and i understand they have to do that with the prices going up and up   umhum umhum   but um you just might as well knock of a couple thousand dollars from your salary you know to pay for this medical care and then i i dont have kids so im not worrying about family coverage   oh at least at least   but once you get into family coverage its crazy   oh its out its outrageous and then a lot of companies you know offer you know you can have a certain amount deducted pre tax from your pay check for medical expenses but not covered by insurance but   it its just crazy yes   you know thats something thats something fairly new and not a lot of people take advantage of it but its you know its use it or lose it and i   umhum umhum   know people at the end of the year you know that have had that money checked out regularly and then its like well lets see i guess i could go get a new of glasses  you know   right they have a hundred dollars to spend in December i know what you mean   you know get a big crown done you know things like that but   yeah we do that too were fortunate though this year somehow how its only March and weve already used up our entire amount i dont know if thats good or bad   i know yeah um do you think that that that the insurance and all theyve got in Europe does it cover dental or is it just medical   i dont know um i think it covers a portion because like i said my sister lives over there and they they just they just never have to worry about it i think it might not cover full dental but it does cover some and again it covers you know     umhum   major things it wont cover cosmetic type things you know if you choose to do something but um its just like all in its just all in practice its all in plan i think that we could learn from that   yeah what motivates people to go into medicine are the doctors you know how how do the doctors   i dont know i really dont know i know that they do equally as well there as they do here i mean doctors still have that same status     they do so theyre getting paid   i dont know i guess theyre getting paid for it one way or another and and i would imagine although i dont know maybe there still are private practices there i dont know   yeah i yeah i dont know either   i dont know but um it would be great and and if only i mean health is probably the one thing that people should be most concerned with you know especially that makes a good society when people are healthy and theyre not you know theyre not stealing for money to pay for their doctors bills   yeah   you know theyre theyre going to work every day because theyre not sick you know i mean just something that should be more of a priority than it is now   yeah i definitely agree and i remember back in high school being on the debate team and that was one of the subjects one of the debates should we have you know national health care and i remember debating for it   yeah umhum umhum well at least let them start off gradually you know fine so they wont jump into paying full health care let them pay you know partial and each year just you know lets increase it from there   yeah yeah right   i dont know but   i i dont know its going to be hard to switch i think that were going eventually end up end up that way though i just dont see how we can yeah i think itll take   umhum itll take a while maybe our grandchildren will know it   i agree itll take a while but i think we have to be headed   yeah umhum   have to be headed in that direction   umhum well it was nice tal king to you yeah maybe one day well all have health care   nice talking to you too first person from not from Texas that ive talked to   its what   youre the first person not from Texas that ive talked to   oh i know like i said everyones been in from Texas all righty well take care okay byebye     okay you too byebye
