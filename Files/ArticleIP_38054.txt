HeyPru                                                      Ive got a verywicked idea about who you really are I think youre a fat balding guy in hismiddle s who smokes cigars while reading those heartrending missives fromperplexed readers Trs cool                                       Rick St T                        Dear Rick            And what do you plan toread now that youve finished Miss Lonelyhearts  Actually Prudie is aknockout And modest too            Prudie laughingly                                             DearPrudence                                                      What you really needto tell  is that Wicca and paganism are simply other religions Of coursetheir followers dont believe in evil or worship Satan For one thingChristians created Satanso hes their guy not ours To be evil is to goagainst everything youre taught by the Wiccan religion                                       Just Concerned                        Dear Just            Talk about toil andtrouble  Prudie was inundated by lotsa mail on this subject Interestinglythe Wiccan mail was friendly polite and informative Blessed be The fewstinky letters were from clergymen Go figure            Prudie bewitchingly                                             Prudie                                                      I recently married a woman who is a devoutMormon Needless to say she has spent a fair amount of time trying to convertme I believe that a persons views on religion divinity and so on areindividual I respect the right of anyone to believe as he or she sees fit buthonestly I find the whole Latter Day Saints faith a load of dingokidneysrestrictive racist and condemnatory I also find their attitudessanctimonious and superior and in line with many fundamentalist Christianfaiths                                       So how do I tell myyoung much younger wife that I want her to cool down the rahrah Mormon bitI love her dearly but this is driving me nuts                                       Alisdair                        Dear Al            Prudie is astounded that you and the little womandid not discuss this rather loaded subjecton which you differprofoundlybefore the strains of Here Comes the Bride filled the church Andshe wonders if resolution will even be possible  what with the Mrs tryingto convert you to her religion  which you view as a load of dingo kidneysIf you love her dearly as you say it will be necessary to reach an agreementprobably with a referee whereby you both hew to your own beliefs and do notdiscuss them You might tell the beloved that you have decided to become Jewishjust to end the discussion Prudie is kidding            It is a storm signalhowever that you use the words racist restrictive condemnatorysanctimonious and superior about your wifes faith and her fellowpractitioners Prudie can only hope that as a counterbalance her personalqualities are gorgeous loving brainy witty and rich Not to bepessimistic but Prudie envisions another letter from you down the line            Prudie worriedly                                             Prudence                                                      I am a gay divorcedfather who also happens to work in a Catholic school I am out to my exwifefamily and some close friends but am hesitant to come all the way out for fearof the implications I do not care what people think about me but I dont wantto bring any negative publicity to the school I love education and would hateto leave it I want to find a life partner to share my days with but mycurrent employment prevents me from doing so I am tired of living in thecloset and want to be me without having to live two lives Can youhelp                                       Mr Q                        Dear Mr            Closets are for clothes and two lives mean splitpersonalities Prudie would encourage you to reorganize your life so that it ishonest The first thing to try would be to talk with someone in authority atyour school about your sexual preference to ask if it poses a problem Theanswer may well be in the affirmative seeing as how one parochial schoolsacked a female teacher because she was divorced  But this will at leastbe a start Prudie is a little unclear as to why your being gay would bringpublicity to the school but only you know why you think this is so            Because you say youwould hate to leave the educational field why not move to a public or privateschool if your Catholic school boss finds homosexuality a problem Take it fromPrudie all schools have gay and lesbian teachers Its a percentagething And Prudie wishes you all the best in your private romantic life            Prudie openly                                             DearPrudence                                                      My boss is a really great guy and the best bossIve ever had Theres just one problem He whistles incessantly                                       I find whistlingirritating at best but it is positively nervewracking when Im trying toconcentrate at work My office is two doors down from his so theres noescaping the sound Ive tried to discreetly play music but it doesnt drownhim out Ive also tried shutting my door but in our office culture thatsconsidered uncomfortably secretive and standoffish Any ideas on how I can savemy sanity and my job                                       Whistlers Brother                        Dear Whis            Prudie finds whistling annoying too It is an oddsound and like chewing gum should best be done in private You may have blownthe problem out of proportion however Surely this really great guy thebest boss youve ever had could not be so unreasonableor thinskinnedas totake umbrage at your request for a whistlefree workplace            Make your remarkspositive Tell him in your own words that it pleases you that he manifestssuch happy feelings but the musical expression of his joy distracts you andkeeps you from putting out your very best work A really great guy is not goingto react with anything but understanding Unless he is so dense that lightbends around him he will accede to your request and be grateful that you spokeup            Prudie fearlessly
