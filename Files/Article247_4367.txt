They broke the rules They defied the order writes someone namedKen Shulman in an introductory essay will rub off on the retail clothingchain To check out the abbreviated Web version of Benettons deathrowadvertorial click here            According to a press release posted on Benettons home pageBenetton is launching a campaign that is                                                                  about the death penalty italics Benettons dont askChatterbox what they mean  Leaving aside any social political judicial ormoral consideration   this project aims at showing to the public thereality of capital punishment so that no one around the world sic  will consider the death penalty neither  sic as  sic  a distant problem nor  sic  as sic  news that occasionally appear  sic  on TV The campaign will appear on billboards and on the pages of the major newspublications in Europe America and Asia in January   With this newinitiative Benetton has once again chosen to look reality in the face bytackling a social issue as it did in previous campaigns that focused on warAids discrimination and racism Bitterly attacked by some and internationallyacclaimed by others Benettons campaigns have managed to tear down the wall ofindifference contributing at  sic  raising the awareness ofuniversal problems among worlds  sic  citizens At the sametime they have paved the way for innovative modes of corporatecommunication                   italics Chatterboxs                                        Dont get Chatterbox wrong like Benetton he is opposed to capitalpunishment But its attempt to harness this principled stand to the selling ofhighnecked mohair sweaters Peruvian folk ponchos and lycralined lacepanties does tend to trivialize the issue in much the same way that itsprevious campaigns trivialized war AIDS discrimination and racism Thecatalog also objectifies real people Looking at the photos of murderersawaiting execution one feels invited to askare they human beings Or arethey objets de couture             No doubt Benetton would consider this characterization terribly unfairAfter all it didnt just put together a bunch of photographs it also hiredKen Shulman a freelance journalist who works for Newsweek  accordingto the Web press release to conduct interviews with the inmates Here are someof the questions Shulman asked                                             What does this place sound like at nightWhat did you think of Bill Clinton and Monica LewinskyWhats it like when you lose a person youve been close toWhats wrong with the world todayDo you think youre unluckyWhat is your favorite part of the BibleDo you miss real food                                       Here are some questions Shulman never asked or if he did neverincluded in the final version                                             Why did you kill that personWould you be sorry you killed if youd never been caughtCan you imagine circumstances in which youd kill again                                       According to a note at the end of the catalog Individuals were notpermitted to speak about the crime guilt or innocence or prison conditionsunless specifically requested by their attorney Benetton might just as wellhave added And we had no interest in discussing these crimes with thefamilies of the murder victims The prison inmates may be objectified butthe people they killed dont seem to exist at all Chatterbox is especiallyperplexed by Benettons reluctance to investigateeven inquire abouttheguilt or innocence of these deathrow inmates The judicial systems tendencyto mark the odd innocent soul for death is after all one of the more powerfularguments against capital punishment At first Chatterbox thought perhapsBenetton didnt probe individual cases because it didnt want to demonstratethat most deathrow inmates are indeed guilty Not even the mostbleedingheart deathpenalty opponent would dispute that On reflectionthough Chatterbox thinks Benettons fear is more likely the opposite Itdoesnt want to find any innocent men or women The point after all isto be outr  Killers are outr  Wrongly accused prison inmatesare merely tragic Imagine trying to sell a pair of shantung trousers with thepitch It will make you look like a victim
