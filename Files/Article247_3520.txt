                                 Whos Afraid of Amazoncom            Youd think that gossips everywherewhich is to say everyoneeverywherewould be grateful Amazoncoms latest innovation its purchase circles lets customers in one Zip code or at onecompany see what books are selling well among customers in other Zip codes orat other companies Videos and CDs too but somehow Culturebox isnt asinterested in them So for instance Culturebox who lives in suburbanPelham NY and works at Microsoftwhere Alice McDermotts novel CharmingBilly and Bill Gates Business  the Speed of Thought are the twotop books respectivelygets not only to spy on her neighbors and coworkersbut also to find out what her fellow citizens in Anniston Ala andcounterparts at a competing hightech company IBM are reading Jerry Jenkinsand Tim LaHayes wackedout Christian scifi thriller Apollyon TheDestroyer Is Unleashed  and a boringsounding book called The ProfitZone How Strategic Business Design Will Lead You to Tomorrows Profits respectively This strangely satisfying form of literary eavesdroppingachieved by a simple resorting of customers email domain names shippingaddresses and purchases is not limited to the continental United StatesWhats hot in Israel A page scholarly tome called Israel and theBomb  In Puerto Rico Esmeralda Santiagos memoir Almost a Woman  InKenya Management guru Peter Druckers Management Challenges for thest Century                        Purchase circles are a simple but brilliant conceptual coup Whoever thoughtthem up understood a fundamental principle of salesmanship or rather herdpsychology People want to know what everyone else in their peer group isdoing so they can do it too Statistically speaking the data are meaninglesssince the company doesnt reveal the sample size behind each list There couldbe anywhere from  to three people in Pelham making Charming Billyits best seller But no ones claiming that these lists represent some largertruth about the book market such truths are elusive anyway since publishersare notoriously secretive about sales figures Theyre a hint of the regionaland cultural differences among us no more as well as the mildly gallingsimilarities John Grisham Tom Brokaw and Thomas Harris top the book lists inat least one city in almost every state in the Union Plus theyre fun Whocould fail to be titillated by the fact that the No  bestselling book inBrooklyn is Kosher Sex A Guide to Passion and Intimacy             Well the American Booksellers Association and Internet privacy groups forstarters They consider Amazons purchase circles an invasion of privacy yoursand your employers Certain exaggerations asidethat people could deduce acompanys secret strategies or level of workplace satisfaction from theiremployees reading lists for instancetheir argument amounts to the oldslippery slope If Amazon will do this what else will it do The answer ofcourse is as much as it can get away with If you dont already know thatAmazon is keeping a file on you you ought to be forbidden to shop on theInternet The companys business strategy has been widely publicized Amazonbelieves that if it ever turns a profit it will do so by exploitinginformation gained from its customers to sell them other products Since theintegrity of its customer database is of tremendous importance to Amazon wecan probably take its executives at their word when they say in a policy page that appears to have gone up yesterday thatthey wont give out any information that could identify you personally Forinstance no purchase circle is being created for groups of less than people Amazon has no reason to want to piss you off            Thats why much of the alarm about Internet privacy strikes Culturebox asChicken Littleish Consumer rage is disastrous for any business whose profitspresent or future depend on its ability to compile and deploy information onits customer There are just too many ways for shoppers to undermine thedatacollection process At Amazon for instance they can opt out of bothpurchase circles and general customer profiling by sending in blank emailsCompanies can keep themselves out of purchase circles by faxing in a requestIf consumers get mad enough they can bail out of Amazon altogether and buytheir books at Barnes  Noble Online which as yet does not have purchasecircles If enough Amazon customers opt out it might be reduced to offeringthem discounts or other goodies to opt inwhich would be fabulous forshoppers but of dubious economic value to Amazon as Cultureboxs formercolleague Bruce Gottlieb has shown            Obviously sometimes the privacy advocates are right This week theyre alsoupset about U S West the Denverbased phone company that recently won onappeal its lawsuit against the Federal Communications Commission and they havegood reason to be The FCC had tried to prevent the U S West and othercompanies who became party to the suit from exploiting a customers personalinformationcalls made services ordered etcto sell that customer moreservices and products The ruling did not give the companies the right to sellthis data to third parties The judge ruled that keeping a company from usingits customer databases to inform its sales pitches infringed on its freecommercial speech That seems true in generalwhy shouldnt companies use whatyou freely give thembut wrong in this case U S West has a virtual monopolyon local phone service in its region so the usual freemarket remedies dontapply            Culturebox would urge consumers to have faith in the power of corporateselfinterest to protect them at least in nonmonopolistic situations exceptthat shes not convinced that thats whats really causing the general publicto wax wroth She suspects its more what Amazons invention reveals aboutshopping nowadays that it takes place inside an endless hall of mirrors Afterall whats better than shopping Watching ourselves shop Watching ourselvesbeing watched as we shop Watching the watchers who watch us as we shop Adinfinitum and nauseum
