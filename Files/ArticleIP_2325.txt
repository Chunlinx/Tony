                                 Flytraps Trashy Books            Scandals customarilygenerate lots of quick trashy literature the kind of unedited misspelledgarbage designed to sell scads of copies before people realize just how junkyit is But Flytrap until now has been a publishing flop The last few weekshave finally brought the first crop of scandal books William J BennettsThe Death of Outrage Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals Ann Coulters High Crimes and Misdemeanors The Case Against BillClinton  and Jerome D Levins The Clinton Syndrome The President andthe SelfDestructive Nature of Sexual Addiction             None ofthese books is Flytraps All the Presidents Men or should that beWomen  The books are for the most part shameless attempts to exploitthe nations sorrow for money and fame They are essentially clip jobsrepackaging newspaper and TV reports with a gloss of new opinion But there issomething interesting about them the three distinct strains of Clintoncriticism they represent                            Somber Moral Instruction                        Unsurprisingly Bennettsproject in The Death of Outrage is to stiffen Americas backbone topersuade us to care about Clintons misdeeds and to punish them He writesAmerican citizens know betterand they will demonstrate that indeed they doknow better Americans will realize they are being played for fools by thepresident and his defenders                           The Death of Outragesuffers from the same surfeit of selfrighteousness that plagues all Bennettsventures It is jacketed with the sober brown paper that covered The Book ofVirtues  and it seems a calculating attempt by Bennett to secure hisfranchise as Americas scold in chief Bennetts pose of nonpartisan moralauthority annoying enough when he writes for kids seems particularly forcedin The Death of Outrage  Click for a spectacular example            After reading Bennetthowever I began to think that the consciousnessraising he preaches mightactually be possible He is a fine rhetorician and The Death of Outragemakes the best case yet for public condemnation of Clinton Bennetts argumentsare nothing you havent read before on the New York Times editorial pageor in the Weekly Standard  but theyre powerful nonetheless Basicpremises Clintons reckless repeated adultery weakens essential moral codeshis betrayal of vows and his lies undermine public trust his use of legalchicanery to duck ethical responsibility is cowardly and grotesque thepublics silence in the face of this is a capitulation moral disarmamentand America which has always believed that politicians moral behaviormatters must start judging Clintons character            But theinspiration of this book is its tone Bennett is obviously obsessed partisanand furious about Flytrap yet he has managed to write a book without vitriolHe refrains from gloating He chastises others for their glee in savagingClinton He takes Clintons immorality so seriously that he cant even jokeabout it Like television the book is a cool medium Bennetts anger isconvincing because he holds it in check                            Rage                        I realized the effectivenessof Bennetts restraint when I opened Coulters High Crimes andMisdemeanors  which represents the second strain of criticism If Bennettis superego Coulter is id Bennett says in measured tones what conservativesought to believe MSNBC pundit Coulter screams what they really feel                           High Crimes has twoprincipal aims  to explain what historically and legally constitutes animpeachable offense summary moral offenses not just criminal ones and  tobuild an impeachment case against Clinton by summarizing his malfeasance ineverything from the Paula Jones case to campaign fund raising to Webb Hubbellsjob search to the White House Travel Office to Monica Lewinsky But Coulterwhose TV manner is that of a woman going stark raving mad is the wrong personto write a sober legal tract High Crimes is supposed to show thatClintons enemies have a strong legal case against him Instead it suggestsClintons enemies are nutters            Coulter argues ad hominemClintons China satellite policy was treason He is The ManchurianCandidate and a horny hick Clinton doesnt allow alcohol in the Oval Officebecause it might interfere with his potency She says Newsweek sEleanor Clift has gone beyond the call of duty to earn her presidentialkneepads                           HighCrimes is painfully shoddy even for a book rushed to press Misspellingsare commonplace Quotes are muffed Clintons most famous comment I did nothave sexual relations with that woman Miss Lewinsky is rendered I never hadsexual relations with that woman Entire paragraphs are repeated nearly wordfor word in different chapters of the book Coulter claims to lay out thefacts against Clinton but its hard to trust her In I happen to knowsomething about she grossly misrepresents evidence to make Clinton look worseCoulters legal scholarship is so repetitious and garbled that its hard topuzzle out her definition of high crimes and misdemeanors Its as though thebook was not edited at all                            Psychobabble                        I did not think a book couldbe any worse than High Crimes  Then I encountered JeromeLevinswhoops I mean Dr Jerome Levins The Clinton Syndrome Psychotherapist Levins ostensible purpose is to use Clintons problems tobring attention to sex addiction His underlying purpose seems more cynical toget his shoddy little book stocked in both the political and selfhelpsections            To these ends Levin haswritten a psychological profile of the president as sex addict According toLevin the root of Flytrap is Clintons hang up As the child of an enablerand a rageaholic as well as an ACOA Adult Child of Alcoholics Clintonbecame a chronic musterbator a boy who overachieved in order to win theunconditional love that was missing at home He sought it in power in thelove of the crowd and especially in casual sex But all were poor substitutesfor true love and didnt vanquish his feelings of inadequacy and guilt Thedeaths of Ron Brown an olderbrother figure to Clinton Yitzak Rabin animportant father figure and his mother a mother figure made Clintonvulnerable to Lewinsky            The more I thought aboutit writes Levin the more I realized that Clinton had about as much chanceof leaving her alone as a cocaine addict has of passing up a line Clintondeserves sympathy and compassion not vitriol because he exercises no controlover his compulsive sexual behavior Straightfaced conclusion Clinton shouldhold SCA Sexual Compulsives Anonymous chapter meetings at the White Housethus inspiring millions of other Americans to overcome their addictions            Never mind that the veryexistence of sex addiction is questioned by most respectable shrinks Nevermind that Levins profile of Clinton is constructed from a papiermch of AMRosenthal columns and episodes of Charlie Rose  Never mind that TheClinton Syndrome is filled with gobbledygook such as Let us sum up BillClintons early childhood influences in terms of biopsychosocialdeterminants Lets not and say we did Never mind that its even more badlyedited than High Crimes  Never mind that this flimflam is padded to booklength with  pages of irrelevant stories about other addicts It doesntmatter This is Flytraps moment Arianna Huffington is touting Levin on theair and his book is stacked high by the register at my local Borders                           Thesidebar on Bill Bennetts selfrighteousness is  The sidebar on how AnnCoulter misrepresents a Clinton story is                         More Flytrap
