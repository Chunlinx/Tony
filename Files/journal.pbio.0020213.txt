                            In July  the finger of blame for a mysterious mass killer of Californian oak trees        came to rest on a previously undescribed plant pathogen From the initial identification of                Phytophthora ramorum  it took less than four years to produce a        draft sequence of its genome one of the fastestever discoverytosequence stories for a        complex pathogen This achievement was a United States initiative facilitated by the        injection of federal and state funding into         Phytophthora research But the US is not alone in the battle        against this genus         Phytophthora species cause thousands of millions of dollars of        damage to the worlds commercial crops every year they blight potatoes and tomatoes        devastate the lucrative soybean and rot cacao threatening the worlds supply of chocolate        Figure  But for Sophien Kamoun Associate Professor of Plant Pathology at Ohio State        University Wooster Ohio United States these destructive organisms present an exciting        opportunity There are some  species of         Phytophthora  but so little is known about the genus he says        that there are things about its species we didnt even know we didnt know What I find        really exciting he says is discovering these unknown unknowns        The most infamous of the         Phytophthora pathogens is the potato late blight         P infestans  It was this species that led to the Irish potato        famine in the mids which resulted in the death or displacement of millions Today         P infestans is estimated to cost potato and tomato farmers        US a year in lost revenue The story for the soybean pathogen         P sojae is similar causing loss of more than US        a year to soybean growers In addition to the direct economic impact of these pathogens        introduced         Phytophthora can cause severe damage to native flora The most        recent         Phytophthora on the scene is         P ramorum  which has caused sudden oak death SOD in tens        of thousands of oak trees across the coastal counties of California is now present in at        least three other US states and is threatening to take on the native flora of the entire        North American continent It is also lurking in Europe although apparently with less        devastating consequences                    Molecular Machinery        With this kind of impact its no surprise that money has poured into research on         Phytophthora  This year the US federal government will channel        US toward research into SOD A major focus of this funding is genomics        Sequencing the genomes of several         Phytophthora will help clarify the phylogeny and evolution of        these enigmatic organisms Box  and improve methods of detection and identification        Ultimately however sequencing should reveal the molecular tricks that this genus uses to        subvert the defences of its plant hosts allowing scientists to come up with new ways to        combat these troublesome organisms        The         P infestans sequencing initiative coordinated by Kamoun has        recently completed a survey sequence of the genome that gives an initial understanding of        how this organism is structured Perhaps most striking is its size Its a huge genome        says Kamoun At about  megabases Mb its about twice the size of the         Arabidopsis genome His latest research published in the         Journal of        Biological Chemistry Tian et al  describes a         P infestans protease inhibitorextracellular protease inhibitor         EPIthat could be one of a unique class of suppressor proteins that         Phytophthora deploy to infect and counteract host defences The        pathogen seems to upregulate the         epi gene during colonisation of its host EPI inhibits plant apoplastic        proteasesextracellular enzymes that are part of the hosts defensive armoury that have        evolved to prevent foreign proteins entering cells        Based on its biological activity and expression pattern EPI may function as a disease        effector molecule and may play an important role in         P infestans colonisation of host apoplast Kamoun and his        colleagues report Tian et al  If further research confirms this function for EPI        then it will become one of just a handful of pathogen molecules that have been shown to        suppress host plant defenses A search in sequence databases for matching motifs reveals        just one similar sequence in the entire bacterial and fungal kingdoms However        apicomplexans like         Toxoplasma gondii that transit through the mammalian digestive        tract also appear to secrete protease inhibitors allied to EPI This similarity suggests        an analogy between plant apoplasts and mammalian digestive tracts Both environments are        rich in proteases but nevertheless are colonised by a variety of microbial pathogens In        the case of an apoplast the pathogen is         P infestans  whilst in the mammalian gut its         T gondii and although they are phylogenetically distant these        pathogens seem to have independently recruited similar secreted proteins to inhibit the        defensive proteases produced by their hosts Interestingly whilst         T gondii inhibitors inhibit gut enzymes trypsin and        chymotrypsin EPI does not suggesting that coevolution between the inhibitors and their        target proteases may shape the specificity of these pathogenic enzymes        Armed with this new insight into the molecular cunning of         P infestans  Kamoun hopes that it will be possible to come up        with ways of slowing disease progression Importantly it looks likely that protease        inhibitors such as EPI are present in other         Phytophthora species There are significant matches between the         epi gene sequence and motifs from at least five other closely related        species So any methods of blocking the action of protease inhibitors in         P infestans might also work against other         Phytophthora  The protease inhibitors are one of Kamouns        unknown unknowns Its an example of something that we had absolutely no idea was in the        genome he says        Even more advanced than the         P infestans genome project is an ongoing collaboration between        the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute Blacksburg Virginia United States and the US        Department of Energys Joint Genome Project based in Walnut Creek California The focus        here is the soybean pathogen         P sojae and the SOD pathogen         P ramorum  for which draft sequences are now complete        wwwjgidoegov The genomes are much smaller than that of the Mb         P infestans         P sojae is about  Mb and         P ramorum is just  Mb This in part explains the        comparative speed of these sequencing efforts But another factor is undeniably the fear of        the unknown         P ramorum  which in  netted the VirginiaCalifornia        initiative US in federal funding to describe its genome Ultimately however the        sequence of one species will help to inform on the sequence of other related species        Brett Tyler Research Professor at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute is focusing on        the molecular tools used by         P sojae to infect its host He agrees with Kamoun that        understanding this machinery is the way to devise new control measures that could give        plants the upper hand in the evolutionary arms race against their         Phytophthora pests At present most strategies to limit the        damage caused by species like         P infestans and         P sojae rely on developing resistant cultivars by selective        breeding of varieties with major resistance genessingle genes that can block a pathogen        However         Phytophthora seem able to find ways to overcome these efforts         P infestans is absolutely notorious for its ability to        genetically change in response to a major resistance gene says Tyler Typically major        resistance genes in potato barely last a single season        Things look better for the soybean New cultivars containing major resistance genes show        resilience to         P sojae for five to ten years However this resistance is        starting to break down and breeders are running out of major resistance genes with which        to conjure new varieties The alternative says Tyler is quantitative or multigenic        resistance which relies on getting plants to express several resistance genes at once        each of which makes a small contribution to the plants overall resistance It should be        much harder for         P sojae to evolve a new attack against this kind of robust        defence The search is also on for new genes that could be used to encourage quantitative        resistance to host species One particularly promising approach is to pit pathogen against        host to see which genes are switched on The host should upregulate genes that defend it        against infection and the pathogen should upregulate genes that it needs to attack The        discovery that plants produce proteases and that         Phytophthora have responded by secreting protease inhibitors to        disable them is important if longlasting solutions are to be found We just need to find        a way to introduce new proteindegrading enzymes into the plant that the pathogen doesnt        know how to block says Tyler With these genomic tools we can really accelerate the pace        at which we can evaluate different possible protective measures                    Epidemiology Identifying the Culprit        An additional benefit of the abundance of genetic information is that species        identification is becoming increasingly sophisticated At a glance         Phytophthora can be mistaken for a fungus so DNA profiling of        isolates is crucial if species and strains of species are to be identified correctly so        that action appropriate to each infection can be taken Since  Matteo Garbelotto        Adjunct Professor of Mycology and Forest Pathology at the University of California at        Berkeley Berkeley California United States has spent a significant part of his working        life tracking the spread of         P ramorum  the         Phytophthora that has killed off vast tracts of oak trees in        native Californian forest Box         DNA analysis has been crucial to confirm suspected cases of         P ramorum  and has now revealed that infections have reached        at least three other US states This spread is probably due to the movement of infected        ornamentals like rhododendron         Rhododendron spp and viburnum         Viburnum spp which seem to act as carriers for the pathogen        What were seeing is a parallel to what has been happening throughout Europe where the        infection has basically moved using the commercial routes of the ornamental plant        industry Garbelotto says                    P ramorum in Europe                P ramorum does not appear to have the same devastating        consequences in Europe as it does in the USat least not yet Its not entirely clear why        but it could have something to do with the structure of the bark of different host species        suggests Garbelotto We normally see more infection where we have more corrugation and        thats because water accumulates in the fissures  where the zoospores have a chance to        infect the bark However he notes European beech         Fagus sylvatica  appears to be extremely susceptible to         P ramorum  If it reaches areas where there are a lot of        beeches it could potentially mirror whats happening in California he warns        In Europe symptoms characteristic of         P ramorum infection were first described on rhododendrons in        The Netherlands in  Once this was confirmed to be the same species as the pathogen        responsible for Californian SOD there was speculation that         P ramorum had either been introduced to the US from Europe or        vice versa However in December  it emerged that these two populations are of        different mating typesA in Europe and A in the US The latest research from Garbelotto        and his colleagues due to be published in         Mycological Research Ivors et al  supports this        interpretation demonstrating that although they belong to the same species A and A are        distinct lineages and have not exchanged genes for a long time But last year a batch of        isolates from infected camellias         Camellia spp and rhododendrons in a nursery in Washington        state showed that the A and A strains were living side by side That was a big surprise        for us recalls Garbelotto We had no knowledge at that point that both the European and        the North American type could be present in the same nursery                    The Threat of Recombination        Hybridisation between different species of         Phytophthora can produce a new species with different properties        from those of either parent One of the best cases comes from Europe where a new         Phytophthora emerged in  that began to attack alder trees         Alnus spp Research carried out by scientists in the United        Kingdom demonstrated that the alder         Phytophthora was a product of a hybridisation event between         P cambivora and an unknown species similar to         P fragariae  neither of which attacks alder        Given this propensity for         Phytophthora species to hybridise and new phenotypes to emerge        there is legitimate concern that sexual recombination between the A and A mating types        could produce something more devastating than either form Within the controlled confines        of his laboratory Garbelotto has been exploring whether the two types of         P ramorum can get it together Initial findings are that        oosporesthe product of sexual recombinationare being produced although most of them        abort before they reach maturity However  progress further and microscopically at        least look like they could be functional Theyll germinate he predicts        The threat that hybridisation could create a novel strain with a different host range is        a concern that the UK is also taking seriously In December  an entirely new         Phytophthora was isolated from two sites in England Although        the new speciescurrently referred to as         Phytophthora taxon C sp nov         P  taxon C appears to cause relatively mild damage to its        beech and rhododendron hosts the UKs Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs        DEFRA acknowledges that hybridisation of         P  taxon C with         P ramorum could have serious consequences The potential for        the pathogen to adapt further to its putative new environment intrinsically or via        hybridisation is not known note the authors of a DEFRA report on the mystery species        wwwdefragovukplanthpraforestpdf Longdistance spread could easily occur through        the movement of infected stock of rhododendron or beech and possibly other as yet unknown        hosts they warn        DEFRA is monitoring the situation closely Figure  However on the basis of a        preliminary DNA analysis         P  taxon C and         P ramorum are only distantly related making hybridisation        unlikely says Joan Webber Head of Pathology at the UK governments Forestry Commission        The closest known relative of         P  taxon C is         P boehmeriae  a pathogen that has been recorded on several        species of tree in China and Australia and on cotton in China and Greece suggesting        possible origins for the newly described species But says Webber the sequence match        between         P  taxon C and         P boehmeriae is only not especially close Much more        evidence is needed to build a strong case for the origin of this new         Phytophthora  she says                    Origins        Indeed it has taken more than  years to track down the geographical origin of the         P infestans strain that caused the Irish potato famine Jean        Beagle Ristaino of North Carolina State University Raleigh North Carolina United States        is due to publish in         Mycological Research an analysis of DNA extracted from diseased        potato plants preserved from the nineteenthcentury Irish epidemic May and Ristaino         It had long been suspected that the famine was caused by the Ib strain of         P infestans  which is presumed to have originated in Mexico        However Ristainos molecular evidence spotlights the Ia strain and traces its probable        roots to the Andes The infection could have found its way from South America to Europe and        the US via exports of potato seed on steamships she speculates        This kind of forensic treatment is more than just interesting Tracing a         Phytophthora species to its site of origin could reveal what        keeps them at bay in the areas where they are native and might suggest new ways to manage        them when they are introduced to a different ecosystem says Garbelotto Theres a huge        amount of information that can be learned from understanding where theyre coming from So        where do pathogens like         P ramorum originate The best lead Garbelotto says is the        ease with which it infects rhododendron These ornamentals are natives of Asia but there        are only a few places where the climate would suit         P ramorum  The most promising he suggests are the Southern        Himalayas the Tibetan plateau or Yunnan province in China But these are big places and        Garbelotto has plenty on his plate in his battle against the Californian SOD I am not        very hopeful that well ever be able to find out where it comes from he says
