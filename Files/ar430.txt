                    Introduction        Rheumatoid arthritis RA is a significant chronic        disease that afflicts  of the general population in most        countries     Joint damage typically occurs before        patients are diagnosed and most of the joint destruction        occurs within the first  years of diagnosis            Therapeutic drugs such as sulfasalazine and methotrexate        MTX only slow the progression of the disease suggesting        that these drugs fail to adequately quell the underlying        pathophysiology of RA            Tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF is elevated in sera        and synovial fluid of patients with RA suggesting that it        may play a role in the pathology of the disease            Soluble TNF receptor or neutralizing antibodies against        TNF have been shown to prevent collageninduced arthritis        in mice      Furthermore a human TNF hTNF        transgenic mouse Tg develops a chronic progressive        polyarthritis with histologic features in common with RA            Weight loss and joint swelling in these mice are        correlated with expression of hTNF mRNA in the joints           and hTNF concentrations in the serum             Previously Keffer         et al    showed that progression        of disease in these mice could be prevented by treatment        with antiTNF monoclonal antibody mAb In this study        we utilized the Tg mouse model to further assess whether        antiTNF treatment can ameliorate established disease in        both young and aged mice                    Materials and methods                  Tg mice and antiTNF mAb treatment          Heterozygous Tg transgenic mice obtained from Dr          George Kollias Hellenic Pasteur Institute Athens          Greece     were identified by PCR analysis using          primers to the modified hTNF gene Two experimental          groups of  mice were used Young mice were enrolled          into the study when they developed clinical signs of          arthritis at  or  weeks of age A second group of mice          was maintained diseasefree with  mgkg of antiTNF          mAb weekly starting at  weeks of age when they reached           weeks of age the treatment was stopped and these          aged mice were allowed to develop arthritis before they          were enrolled into the study The enrollment criteria for          both young and aged mice required them to have a clinical          score of at least  on two limbs The experimental          protocols were approved by Centocors Institutional          Animal Care and Use Committee          The murine antiTNF mAb used in this study binds          with high affinity to hTNF and prevents binding to the          TNF receptor     AntiTNF mAb was administered by          intraperitoneal injection at  mgkg weekly and the          animals in the control group received weekly injections          of saline                          Clinical scores          Clinical scores were based on a previously described          scoring system    modified as follows  normal           edema or distortion of paw or ankle joints           distortion of paw and ankle joints or  ankylosis of          wrist or ankle joints The sum of all four paws was          scored weekly with a maximum possible score of  per          mouse                          Histologic processing of joints          Specimens were processed and scored as described          previously     and in the supplementary          material                          ELISA assay          Serum samples were separated from whole blood which          was collected by intracardiac puncture at baseline and at            and  weeks posttreatment Serum levels of hTNF          were determined by ELISA at a  dilution according to          the manufacturers instructions Biosource International          Camarillo CA USA                          RNA isolation and RNase protection assay          Samples were prepared as described in the          Supplementary material and analyzed in an RNase          protection assay according to the manufacturers          instructions PharMingen San Diego CA USA                          Statistical analysis          All data are expressed as means  standard deviation          unless noted otherwise Statistical significance was          tested using analysis of variance for multiple groups If          significant differences were found pairwise testing was          performed using Tukeys test The level of significance          for all comparisons was set at           P                              Results                  Amelioration of established polyarthritis by          treatment with antiTNF mAb          Increased cartilage turnover and repair in response to          insult has been observed in young mice whereas aged mice          show decreased cartilage turnover after closure of the          growth plate     Therefore antiTNF treatment was          evaluated in both young weekold and aged          weekold Tg mice with established arthritis          The mean clinical arthritis score at baseline was  Fig           indicating arthritis was established at the          commencement of treatment The clinical arthritis score          increased progressively in the salinetreated group and          these mice were humanely killed at  weeks In contrast          the clinical arthritic score was markedly decreased in          the groups both young and aged treated with antiTNF          indicating a marked suppression of their arthritic          symptoms Fig ab Mice in the salinetreated group          progressively lost weight whereas mice in the antiTNF          group showed a significant weight gain throughout the          study see Supplementary Fig  The arthritic score          weeks  to  posttreatment Fig ab and weight          gain weeks  to  posttreatment Supplementary Fig           in the group treated with antiTNF were significantly          improved in comparison with the salinetreated group in          both young and aged mice More importantly the arthritic          scores for the group treated with antiTNF were          significantly improved in comparison with the baseline          score from weeks  through  in both young and aged mice          Fig ab These results indicate that disease          progression was not just prevented but was reversed          following antiTNF treatment                          Effects of treatment with antiTNF mAb on joint          histopathology          All joints were scored in a blinded fashion for          synovitis bone erosions and cartilage degradation using          a predefined scoring system The mean histologic scores          for each treatment group at various time points are shown          in Fig  Saline treatment was followed by increased          histologic scores for synovitis bone erosions and          cartilage damage relative to that observed at baseline          AntiTNF treatment for  weeks significantly reduced          all three histologic scores relative to the baseline          score in young mice Fig  and two of the three          histologic scores in aged mice Supplementary Fig           After  weeks of antiTNF treatment synovial          inflammation and bone erosions were almost completely          resolved in both young and aged mice and a significant          reduction in cartilage degradation in comparison with          baseline was maintained in young mice Cartilage          degradation in aged mice treated with antiTNF was          similar to that at the baseline measurement and          significantly lower than that in the saline treatment          group Supplementary Fig           Representative tissue sections of the ankle joints          from young mice are shown in Fig  Evidence of          arthritic disease was readily observed at baseline Fig          ab and the disease continued to progress in          salinetreated mice at  weeks with increased cell          proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration erosion          of cartilage and bone and loss of proteoglycan from the          cartilage Fig cd However after  weeks of          antiTNF treatment improvements in all          histopathological parameters were observed with both          staining procedures Fig ef No visible evidence of          bone or cartilage erosion was observed and all signs of          cellular proliferation and infiltration disappeared The          proteoglycan content of the cartilage was notably          improved Extended treatment with antiTNF for           weeks maintained normal joint architecture data not          shown These results demonstrate that blocking hTNF          reverses joint inflammation and promotes joint healing in          this model of polyarthritis                          Inhibition of TNF and other proinflammatory          cytokines          To define the underlying mechanisms by which          antiTNF mAb ameliorated joint inflammation and          structural damage the levels of various proinflammatory          mediators were examined First circulating hTNF levels          as detected by ELISA were more than halved as early as           weeks and the reduction was sustained for  weeks after          treatment with antiTNF mAb in comparison with          salinetreated animals Fig a In addition murine          IL IL and IFN mRNA which are expressed in the          arthritic joint tissues were clearly diminished          following antiTNF treatment when total joint RNA was          examined by RNase protection assays see Supplementary          Fig  When the levels of murine IL IL and IFN          mRNA were standardized to glyceraldehydephosphate          dehydrogenase GAPDH Fig bcd a fold          reduction in murine IL and IFN was observed in the          aged animals treated with antiTNF in comparison with          those treated with saline at  weeks posttreatment Fig          bc Interestingly local expression of murine TNF          mRNA was not affected by treatment with antiTNF          antibodies suggesting that hTNF plays a crucial role          in the pathogenesis of arthritis in this model                            Discussion        Currently MTX is the most widely used diseasemodifying        antirheumatic drug for the treatment of RA However MTX        treatment rarely results in complete disease remission           and only slows the progression of joint erosion            In addition longterm treatment with MTX is associated        with pulmonary    and liver toxicities    and other        side effects Therefore a treatment option that        facilitates reversal of joint damage and has longer        effectiveness and fewer side effects is desirable        Experimental arthritis models have contributed to the        basic understanding of joint disease and to the development        of effective antiarthritic agents     Several models        have been used to mimic human RA ranging from immunization        with cartilage components to infection with joint trophic        organisms      Blocking TNF     or IL            in these models has routinely shown benefit although        some questions remain regarding the role of these cytokines        in mitigating joint inflammation versus preventing        cartilage degradation and bone erosion            Using the Tg mice we have shown that maintenance        antiTNF therapy initiated after joint inflammation and        erosions have occurred allows damaged joints to heal        Specifically antiTNF mAb proved equally effective in        reversing joint synovitis and erosions both in young mice        where an active repair process to damage occurs and aged        mice where the repair process has relatively slowed        However the repair of cartilage damage was different        between young and aged mice Cartilage in young mice        treated with antiTNF was significantly improved relative        to salinetreated and baseline mice By comparison        treatment of aged mice with antiTNF prevented further        cartilage damage but did not improve histological scores        relative to baseline values Mechanistically the        therapeutic effect of antiTNF appears to be due to        either neutralization of soluble hTNF or inhibition of        hTNF production in the diseased joint Additionally        other proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs were decreased in the        local diseased tissues either through suppression of        inflammatory cell infiltration or inhibition of cytokine        production Moreover antiTNF treatment resulted in a        modest inhibition of murine IL production in the        diseased joint which is consistent with previous findings        that antiTNF antibody inhibits the generation of IL in        collageninduced arthritis and IL IL and IL in        rheumatoid synovial cultures      Our study provides        preclinical evidence supporting the use of antiTNF mAb        in ameliorating arthritic pathology        The progressive arthritis observed in Tg mice is        similar to the pathology in patients with RA Recent        clinical data indicate that the blockade of TNF        significantly reduces the signs and symptoms of RA            and inhibits the progression of structural damage             It remains to be seen whether extended antiTNF        therapy might permit regeneration of articular cartilage        and bone in established human disease where multiple        etiological pathways may contribute to the RA disease        syndrome      Nevertheless it is likely that much        of the RA pathology involves TNF activation and the        results from the Tg model provide a sound scientific        rationale for the therapeutic benefits observed following        antiTNF treatment in RA patients                    Conclusion        Progression of established polyarthritis in the Tg        hTNF transgenic mouse can be reversed by treatment with        antiTNF mAb as shown by significant improvement in        clinical and histological scores                    Abbreviations        AntiTNF  antitumor necrosis factor alpha ELISA         enzymelinked immunosorbent
