        well Allen do you think that uh all our politicians are totally dishonest or are they just making mistakes like their uh banking business     i think some of them are dishonest and some of them are probably honest mistakes its hard to me to imagine that somebodys going to overwrite uh what what was the largest amount of checks and write out a check for five thousand dollars and not know theyre overdrawing their account   yeah   but on the other hand somebody you know making a couple of overdrawing checks probably isnt a major phenomena i think theyre under a lot of pressure especially when theres money involved and its hard to keep them honest when theyre there for a long time   oh i think so too and i think thats just about the only thing you can do to to clean up government or clean up the political side of government is to kick the bums out periodically limit the terms   well that bothers me because again we ought to have a government where we can choose who we want and when you you know limit terms and you say well even if people want this person they cant have them which is kind of a hard situation too   yeah but but the longer they stay im and im  assuming were just talking about Washington politicians i dont know that much about the state government i figure its pretty rotten too         i mean even the city councils are a little weird if you look at Dallas   or a lot weird     yeah but but have you been to Washington   yes   have have you watched those folks in action i mean i visited the House and the Senate and sat there in the gallery and watched those folks up there pontificating to a room of no one   yeah   and and it it  their their posturing their i dont know i it its like their not in the real world or something and maybe thats why they have have trouble drawing lines as to whats illegal and whats not   well i mean the other problem is is that theyre always up for reelection   sure   so that theyre always not making the right decision but the politically correct decision   yeah   and it it i think thats hard for them plus when you you put the lobbyist back there i wish somehow we could limit lobbyist   well   i think thats a greater problem because theyre constantly trying to use their influence in not always the most positive ways   yes thats true i i think they do things that make it easier for our elected representatives to have to live the good life      yeah   i mean if you if you just look at at what goes on in Washington those folks dont live the same way i do anyway   no   its almost that theyre royalty of some sort and i think thats why they forget sometimes that laws apply to them too   uh seems to me somehow if they could draw a straight salary and not have any other benefits and you know i dont know what the salary ought to be but i think that would decrease somewhat the the need for the kinds of things that sometimes happen   yeah but arent they making something like a hundred and ten thousand a year   well i was shocked i was happened to be reading the voters guide in the last election and a Senator a a a Representative makes a hundred and twenty nine thousand dollars a year which kind of blew my mind  yes yes id like to make that much   thats more uh thats a lot more than i make  huh huh well run for office   uh no thanks   yeah they i i what gets me is when they pass laws and they always manage to exempt themselves from them   or raise they give themselves raises when theyre trying to cut government expenses   oh yes but i mean is it no wonder that theres not a balanced budget when they cant even handle their own checking accounts   yeah   i dont know   and the other problem is you know one of the other questions it asked is is is there someway we can make all unethical things illegal and im just convinced you cant legislate common sense   no probably not   and that seems to be something that a lot of them are missing   thats right i they get caught up i think in the the glamour and the power and whatnot and probably make bad decisions bad choices sometimes   and i think part of the other problem is is because government has such a bad reputation people who might really do well in it tend to avoid it because of all the negative uh feelings about politicians you may have some people who could be do a really good job but they just kind of stay out of it because they dont want to be associated with that kind of thing   thats true thats true i wonder i wonder if Ross Perot would get elected how he would behave   i dont know little nervous about that one too     i i think hes an honest person   yeah i think he definitely is i dont   uh and he and he certainly has no need to have his hands in anybody elses pockets   im just wondering how he would cope with the fact that he cant just do you know sort of looking at the as an outsider at the way he ran his company you either did what he said or you were out and im not sure as a President you could ever run it that
