        okay   all right last thing i saw was um i think uh Sleeping With the Enemy with Julia Roberts   oh i hadnt seen that but ive heard that its real good   my husband didnt like it that much i thought it was okay it was a little strange you know this woman supposedly is um being mentally abused by her husband you know he keeps her pretty much terrorized to stay in the house and she figures out this way to um to leave him secretly you know she fakes her death kind of thing and he tracks her down   uhhuh oh   so the the end scenes are are kind of suspenseful you know when she realizes hes in the house you know after her but uh kind of had the feeling along that uh why didnt she just tell him to straighten up  you know why didnt she just tell him hey look bucko you dont get away with this nonsense   yeah oh   but anyhow um what have you seen   well last week as a matter of fact my children was on spring break and we went to two movies we went to see Awakenings   uhhuh um   with Robin Williams and we went to see Kindergarten Cop   uhhuh yeah     and i really liked both of them i really did Awakening was it was kind of sad to me it really was and it would it would be to anyone because you know they really dont know that much about it   uhhuh so this is where the people have been kind of well i dont a better word to say than like asleep or in a coma for a long time and the drugs let them come back   yeah yeah yeah uhhuh but the drugs didnt work for long and they started having real bad side effects   oh   and this is about nineteen sixty four i believe or something like that and there still hasnt been any you know new development in prescribed drugs that can help it   um   but yeah there you know it it was a big breakthrough but in time you know the all the side effects started showing   well how bad were the side effects   bad   oh     yeah yeah they was actually went back like they were you know   oh um   yeah all it was they wasnt mild you know they was just bad side effects   um   but i really enjoyed it though   um   you know   well how about Kindergarten Cop   oh yeah  thats strictly for entertainment  that was just  it was     you know Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting to be uh a bit of a variety actor you know at first he was just a big muscle man but hes kind of branching out   yeah he sure is he is as a matter of fact um Sylvester Stallone is that his name Sylvester Stallone is that his name i really believe Schwarzenegger is really going to be a variety variety player more so than he is because he really played the part good   uhhuh     you know he could be this rough tough guy and then you know this substitute teacher   um   it was really good   well there was a movie out its been on cable i get cable and theres this thing with uh Danny De Vito called Twins   oh ive seen that yes   i thought that was just great   it is it is isnt it yes yes   i even like some i mean some of the original stuff like i like The Terminator at first you know it was kind of strange but i still like watching him in The Terminator and and some of the other things um   yeah uhhuh   Total Recall last year i thought was really good last summer   oh yeah yeah   guess it didnt last too long at the box office but i thought it was pretty good   yeah i did too i really did   and it was   i enjoy a lot of movies now as far as lets say heavy violence i cant handle   um   im not into that you know i just like Rambo and all that   um   i thats just something i just dont want to watch   yeah yeah and i i have some one person at work i know gets really into those goofy horror flicks   oh   and i just keep telling her how can you do that and i told her when she had her her little girl i said now you better get out of the habit of watching those you shouldnt be watching them with your little girl and she says her little girls into it now   oh my goodness   and she watches she watches these really gross things you know like The Nightmare on Elm Street and the you know that kind of junk i dont go for that at all   yes oh uhhuh yeah oh i guess im a little too scary  for that   i remember when i was real little i we all went to some kind of scary movie and it was like this house big house had a basement and there was all these weird things going on in the basement you know and i was scared to death of our house had a basement for years   oh uhhuh   you know and i got a lot of really weird ideas from that goofy movie   yes yes yes   you know they tell you that kids can you know be impressed by all that stuff and its true i i had a lot of things that i i nobody told me that it was all fake i was just sitting there watching it going oh jeez   it is it really is yes watching yeah watching yes oh i dont want to go home yes yes  oh goodness     but i think a lot of kids its funny get the same kind of fears like theres somebody under the bed   yes oh   where do we get that from   yes i know uh i have two children i really try to watch what they watch i really do because my youngest one he watches something you might as well just plan on staying up all night because you know       hell come in mama i think the ghost is in the house mama i hear it   um   dont you   how old are they   theyre eight and ten       so theyre you know they hadnt really distinguished its just a movie you know i try to say its just a movie but no mama ive seen it   oh but i remember i was with a friend of mine had uh three kids and the little boy must have been oh maybe about ten and we rented Charlottes Web okay   oh uhhuh   and he just bawled at the end and just uh shes not going to die and we were trying to say Kenny its okay and he didnt want to listen to it   oh oh oh   he just was beside himself you know this is supposed to be a nice childrens movie Charlottes Web he just couldnt stand it that Charlotte was going to die at the end   die oh  oh       its funny how your little minds work isnt it oh   oh yeah shes so nice she cant die  oh it was just   oh oh i guess thats why the actors and actresses make millions of dollars people like us you know   oh   oh goodness well well ive enjoyed talking to you   you too   and maybe well run across each other again   yeah this is kind of neat i havent ever initiated a call ive just been called you know by the switchboard and uh well the first week i think a lot more people were doing it but i normally get a call like every other day   do you well as far as we could not call in last week   um   you know from where im at   uhhuh   we couldnt call in they said it would be up Friday the March the fifteenth before it was prepared so i missed several days because i was getting quite a few calls   um how weird i dont know and they they do have a variety of topics my first one was the toughest it was something like discuss pollution     oh uhhuh oh   it was discuss air pollution causes of it and cures i was going oh well   yes oh   oh well my husband sometimes you know hell receive a call and hes at work   uhhuh   and if i you know if i know the topic ill go ahead and accept it as mine but the other day i got one about fishing and i thought oh my         i dont know a thing about fishing so       im not even going to try       because when they listened to that tape they would have really had a good time believe me   say well i know it takes a fishing pole and some bait and some water   but im really not for sure though if  well ill let you go and well talk to you later okay byebye     alrighty byebye
