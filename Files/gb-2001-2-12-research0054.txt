                    Background        Genome sizes in the eubacteria and archaebacteria range        from  megabases Mb to around  Mb   The smallest        of these genomes do not represent ancestral states as was        once believed but are derived from larger genomes through        massive loss of genes The conclusion that small genome        size is evolutionarily derived is based on a combination of        molecular phylogenetic results genome size determinations        and full genome sequences                 Extreme genome reduction producing bacterial genome sizes        in the range of  Mb or less is closely correlated with        symbiotic or pathogenic lifestyles involving obligate        associations with eukaryotic hosts Thus when lineages        make the transition from potentially freeliving lifestyles        to obligately hostassociated ones genome reduction        ensues        An immediate question is whether this reduction occurs        in large steps involving relatively few large losses or        whether it is entirely gradual consisting of loss of        individual genes onebyone Reconstruction of steps        leading to genome reduction requires comparative analysis        of related small and large genomes Public databases now        contain complete sequences for many bacterial genomes of        varying sizes but most of the fully sequenced genomes        under  Mb are very distantly related to genomes of        larger size For example the smallest genome from         Mycoplasma genitalium  Mb        belongs to the Mollicutes a large and ancient clade that        consists entirely of bacteria with reduced genomes            Likewise         Rickettsia prowazekii  Mb is        embedded in a large clade within the alphaProteobacteria        that contains only smallgenome intracellular inhabitants        such as         Ehrlichia Wolbachia pipientis and        mitochondria   Similarly the Chlamydiae including        several fully sequenced organisms are an ancient clade        all characterized by small genomes  Mb   This        phylogenetic distribution hinders reconstruction of the        largegenome ancestors of pathogenic lineages and of the        events leading from a large genome to a very small one        Among fully sequenced published genomes the only        instance of a highly reduced genome that shows a close        relationship to large genomes is         Buchnera aphidicola the obligate        endosymbiont of aphids Insecta On the basis of gene        content and similarity of orthologous genes         Buchnera is closely related to        enteric bacteria including         Escherichia coli gamma        Proteobacteria The         Buchnera endosymbiont of the aphid         Acyrthosiphon pisum has a genome of         kb   only oneseventh the size of the genome of         E coli MG  Mb   The         E coli size is similar to that of        other enterics such as         Salmonella Klebsiella and         Yersinia   The         Buchnera gene inventory consisting        of only  ORFs  tRNAs and a single copy of each rRNA        gene is essentially a subset of that of         E coli   The four annotated        genes lacking obvious homology with         E coli genes seem to be either        recently lost in         E coli or fastevolving genes or        pseudogenes for which orthology would be difficult to        detect I Tamas         et al  unpublished results        Orthologous pairs show an average aminoacid identity of         and S rDNA identity of  between         E coli and         Buchnera                 Buchnera is a mutualistic        endosymbiont of its host but the pattern of reductions of        numbers of genes among functional categories is similar        between         Buchnera and other fully sequenced        smallgenome bacteria all obligate pathogens             The major exception is that the         Buchnera genome contains  loci         of the genome that specify the biosynthesis of amino acids        needed by its host   In contrast pathogenic species        with small genomes have lost these loci and acquire amino        acids from host cells Both         Buchnera and smallgenome pathogens        show reduction in numbers of genes in many functional        categories including biosynthesis of metabolic        intermediates basic cellular processes transcription        translation replication cell division biosynthesis of        phospholipids and repair and recombination Smallgenome        bacteria show convergent features including accelerated        sequence evolution and genomewide base compositional bias        favoring A and T           In attempting to characterize the evolutionary forces        underlying genome reduction a critical question concerns        the size and content of the deletions If genes or operons        have been eliminated individually in separate events their        loss may be governed by the functional roles and        independent fitness effects of individual loci But if a        substantial portion of the reduction has occurred as large        deletion events spanning many kilobases and functionally        unrelated genes the set of genes lost is more reasonably        interpreted as the result of selection acting on the        composite fitness effects of the set of loci deleted The        content of early deletions is expected to affect the        strength of selection for retention of other genes Thus        the final gene inventory might depend in part on chance        combinations of gene order and deletions occurring early in        the process of genome reduction If large deletions have a        role in the early stages of genome reduction then large        contiguous regions of the ancestral genome will be found to        be missing from the reduced genome        Here we examine the process of genome reduction in the        lineage leading to         Buchnera through comparison of its        genome with that of a hypothetical ancestor reconstructed        on the basis of the genomes of         E coli MG and several other        sequenced genomes of enteric bacteria                    Results                  Gene inventory of the reconstructed ancestor          relative to that of Buchnera          A total of  proteincoding genes were retained in          the ancestor out of a total of  genes in           E coli Under the procedures for          reconstructing the ancestral genome A in Figure  a          requirement for inclusion in the ancestor was presence in                    E coli MG As a result the          reconstructed genome is expected to be smaller than that          of the real ancestor because it does not include genes          that were present in the ancestor but lost independently          from both           E coli and           Buchnera lineages Despite the          removal of  of the           E coli genes over  of genes          present in           Buchnera were also retained in the          reconstructed ancestor This outcome strongly supports          this parsimony approach to reconstructing the gene          inventory of the shared ancestor of           E coli and           Buchnera and also of the          hypothesis that           Buchnera evolved from such an          ancestor through gene loss Only two of the           proteincoding genes that show clear orthology between           E coli and           Buchnera would have been removed          due to absence from both           Vibrio cholerae and           Yersinia pestis  The two genes            dnaC and           dnaT  are linked in both           Buchnera and           E coli and were retained in the          ancestor                          Rearrangements in the Buchneralineage          Fragments for which the order and orientation of genes          are the same in           Buchnera and           E coli were assumed to be present          in the common ancestor A syntenic fragment was          recognized if           E coli and           Buchnera showed the same order and          orientation apart from missing genes in           Buchnera and if these missing          genes could not be located elsewhere in the           Buchnera genome example in Figure           Syntenic regions always terminated with loci that          were present in both species          This criterion resulted in  fragments in the          ancestor that contained at least two genes and that          corresponded to regions of synteny between           Buchnera and           E coli Figures   In          addition there were  single genes The longest          syntenic fragment containing the megaoperon of ribosomal          proteins that is widely conserved among bacteria          consisted of  kb spanning  genes in the ancestor and           genes in           Buchnera In addition there were           ancestral regions between these retained fragments          containing genes inferred to be lost in           Buchnera This number is slightly          less than the number of retained fragments  because          whereas most of the retained fragments were flanked by          lost regions a few directly bordered other retained          fragments The ancestral genome was therefore divided          into a total of  fragments just over half of which          were retained in the           Buchnera genome and there are           junctions between these fragments on the circular          chromosome Figure           The evolution of           Buchnera was clearly accompanied by          many chromosome rearrangements and massive changes in          genome size Figures   Remarkably a comparison of          ortholog positions between           Buchnera and           E coli indicates that a pattern of          approximate symmetry of gene distance from the          replication origin and terminus was maintained Figure           This is indicated by an Xpattern when the positions          in the two genomes are plotted against one another with          the origins of replication as endpoints the replication          origin in           Buchnera was designated by          Shigenobu           et al   on the basis of the          position of the only DnaA box present on the chromosome          and on a shift in the GCskew value at third codon          positions around that region This Xpattern has          recently been found to be typical for comparisons of          orthologous regions between pairs of closely related          bacteria     It is most readily explained as          the result of successive inversions around the          replication terminus or origin                          Genes lost as deletions within and between regions          of synteny          On the basis of the reconstructed ancestor a total of           genes in  locations were lost in deletions within          regions of synteny Figure  top These deleted regions          are sometimes large with  regions spanning  or more          genes Figure  top A much larger proportion of the          reduction can be attributed to regions lost between          syntenic fragments  genes were lost in  such          gaps Figure  bottom          For losses occurring both within and between syntenic          fragments a single lost region frequently contains          multiple genes often involved in seemingly unrelated          functions see for example Figures and                           Gene erosion and spacer lengths          Some genes deleted within regions of synteny persist          as partially degraded sequences that range from          pseudogenes having clear homology with the           E coli ortholog   to much          shortened sequences with no recognizable sequence          homology These sequences indicate that function has          sometimes been eliminated initially through a small          deletion or substitution with the remaining DNA sequence          subsequently eroded by multiple mutations that are biased          in favor of deletion over insertion as documented for           Rickettsia    and other          bacteria including           Buchnera   An analysis of           Buchnera pseudogenes showed that          deletions outnumber insertions  versus  and that the          number of nucleotides deleted is over fold greater          than those inserted            An expected result of this gradual gene degradation is          that intergenic spacers that contain gene remnants will          be longer than spacers where no gene loss has occurred           Buchnera spacers can be categorized          into three groups those flanked by the same genes in           Buchnera and the ancestor those          that occur within regions of synteny at positions where          genes are missing in           Buchnera and those that occur          between syntenic fragments Spacers in the first          category which can be considered to be descended from          ancestral spacers have an average length of  bp            n   These ancient spacers are          much shorter than spacers occurring where ancestral genes          have been deleted within syntenic fragments  bp           n   or than spacers occurring          between syntenic fragments also  bp           n   Considering only spacers          within syntenic fragments spacer length does not          increase further when the number of genes lost is greater          than one Figure                           Promoter loss and fusion of transcription          units          Small bacterial genomes typically contain a smaller          proportion of regulatory elements than do larger genomes             Consistent with this trend the genome of           Buchnera has been noted to lack          virtually all regulatory proteins   We examined          promoters within intergenic spacers flanked by the same          genes in both           Buchnera and           E coli under the assumption that          these evolved from a common ancestral sequence and thus          represent orthologous spacers In  of the orthologous          spacers a  promoter is annotated in           E coli on the basis of          experimental evidence andor presence of a promoter          consensus sequence   The consensus sequence for this          promoter is TTGACAl nucleotidesTATAAT from which          the  and  regions are each defined primarily by          three base pairsTTG for the  region and TAT for          the  region    We applied a conservative          criterion for presence of a promoter in           Buchnera by requiring retention of          as few as four of these six nucleotides with a separation          of  nucleotides In  of the  spacers in which          flanking genes are encoded on the same strand and in          which           E coli has an annotated promoter           Buchnera lacks any recognizable          promoter All such apparent losses occurred when the          flanking genes were encoded on the same strand          suggesting that promoter loss is frequent when a group of          newly contiguous genes can be translated as a single          transcriptional unit In some cases fusion of genes into          the same polycistron has occurred following the loss of          intervening genes oriented in the opposite direction          Figure  In contrast in none of the  cases in which          orthologous spacers were located between genes oriented          in opposite directions did           Buchnera lose promoters          On the basis of sequence criteria           Buchnera also shows degeneration of          the ShineDalgarno SD sequences that promote initiation          of translation by binding with the antiSD complement in          rRNA which is widely conserved and identical for           Buchnera and           E coli  Changes in the SD          sequence can impede initiation of translation             In comparisons of spacers orthologous between           E coli and           Buchnera Buchnera showed a lower          number of matches to the core eight nucleotides of the SD          sequence in  of  cases  Also a total of           proteinbinding sites were annotated within           E coli spacers orthologous to           Buchnera spacers that is with the          same flanking genes in the same orientation In           Buchnera only one was preserved          four had half of the sequence maintained and the          remaining  were not detectable          These hypothetical losses of regulatory regions from          the reduced genome of           Buchnera are based on levels of          sequence similarity with the known consensus sequence in          modern           E coli There is no experimental          evidence to eliminate the possibility that the degraded          promoters in           Buchnera are still functional or          that the symbiont uses different promoters from those          identified in           E coli In addition inaccuracies          in the annotated positions of           Buchnera genes in which positions          of start codons are not verified experimentally could          bias analyses of SD sequences                            Discussion                  Genetic drift as a basis for genome          reduction          Endosymbiosis or chronic pathogenesis involves a          metaboliterich environment within host tissues low          growth rates and isolation of strains within host          individuals This combination of factors results in          relaxed selection at many loci and higher levels of          genetic drift affecting the entire genome The reduced          effectiveness of selection is reflected in patterns of          sequence evolution in           Buchnera and other endosymbionts              It is also expected to affect genome          evolution accelerating the loss of genes that are          entirely superfluous as well as those that are beneficial          but not essential          Small genome size itself is likely to reflect lack of          selection for gene retention rather than direct selection          for a compact genome   Especially in the case of           Buchnera which possesses           chromosomes per cell   and in which nonfunctional          pseudogenes can persist for long periods   selection          for reduced DNA content seems an untenable explanation          for its small genome The polyploidy itself may be a          consequence of the loss through genetic drift of one or          more loci involved in regulating and resolving chromosome          replication during the cell cycle          One pattern that has emerged from comparative analyses          of fully sequenced genomes is that although different          pathogen and symbiont lineages approach the same minimal          genome size the inventories of genes retained by these          organisms are extremely different                 Relatively few genes are universally distributed          and universal cellular processes depend in part on          nonorthologous genes The divergence in gene inventories          among smallgenome bacteria implies redundancy in          ancestral genomes underlying central cell processes          including DNA processing transcription and translation          For the most part this redundancy does not arise from          the presence of paralogous genes which are relatively          few in bacteria An examination of the process of genome          reduction as exemplified by           Buchnera could yield insight into          why gene inventories differ among small genomes                          Deletion sizes in the evolution of Buchnera          The comparison of the           Buchnera genome to the          reconstructed ancestral genome suggests that a          considerable part of genome reduction occurred through          large deletions accompanying chromosome rearrangements          One indicator that supports gene loss partly through          large deletions spanning multiple genes is the          distribution of sizes of these regions in the ancestor          Figure  bottom If genes were lost one by one the          expectation is that retained genes would be randomly          mixed with lost genes within the ancestral genome In the          observed distribution lost genes are aggregated          Although part of this clustering might be attributed to          the linkage of functionally related genes this would not          account for the larger segments Another indicator of          gene loss through large deletions is the lack of positive          relationship between spacer length and number of genes          lost for gene deletions that occurred within syntenic          fragments Figure  Thus the most plausible          explanation for much of the gene loss occurring in the          evolution of           Buchnera is the fixation of single          large deletions spanning many genes although it is also          clear that some genes were eliminated through smaller          deletions and gradual erosion Large deletions spanning          multiple genes are possible only early in the reductive          process when many genes are nonessential The content of          initial large deletions will determine the degree of          selection on remaining loci and thus will govern the          ultimate composition of the reduced genome                          Loss of RNA genes          One distinctive aspect of the           Buchnera genome is the presence of          only one copy each of the genes encoding S S and S          rRNA and the separation of these genes into two          transcriptional units with the S rRNA gene            rrs  apart from the others            rrf and           rrl    Typically bacteria          possess multiple rRNA operons each containing all three          genes the           Buchnera ancestor is inferred to          have possessed at least five operons and modern           E coli has seven The remaining          rRNA genes descend from two different ancestral operons          with other rRNA operons lost entirely From flanking          genes it is evident that the two retained transcription          units correspond to           rrsH and           rrfDrrlD of           E coli The missing parts of these          operons            rrfH rrlH and           rrsD  were lost in deletions          within syntenic fragments All other rRNA operons were          lost in entirety as part of regions occurring between          syntenic fragments Thus the modern number and          arrangement of rRNA genes is the result of the loss of          large regions possibly in the course of rearrangements          as well as the elimination of individual genes within          operons                    E coli has  tRNAs and most of          these appear to be present in the ancestor the parsimony          criterion for presence of a tRNA in the ancestor based          on distribution in sequenced genomes is somewhat          unreliable because of sequence homology among different          tRNA genes           Buchnera has only  tRNAs with          most amino acids having only one Assuming that the          ancestor had the same complement of tRNAs as           E coli  were lost from within          syntenic fragments and  were lost in regions between          syntenic fragments Selection enforces the retention of          at least one tRNA for each amino acid as observed in          modern           Buchnera  so the early fixation of          large deletions containing some tRNAs would have created          a selective requirement for the retention of others                          Loss of DNA repair pathways          One example of a functional category that is routinely          reduced in smallgenome bacteria is that consisting of          genes for DNA repair and recombination As is typical for          small genome bacteria           Buchnera has lost a large number of          repair genes Table  In this functional category as          in others the set of retained genes differs among          reduced genomes   For example           Buchnera is unique among sequenced          genomes in having lost           recA which functions in homologous          recombination and repair In contrast           Buchnera retains           recBCD which has been lost by          several other small genomes     The          reconstructed events underlying the loss of individual          repair genes include many large deletions encompassing          many genes Table  For example under the          reconstruction           recA is part of a contiguous          deleted region of about  kb containing ten genes Also          unusual in           Buchnera is the lack of           uvrA uvrB and           uvrC encoding an excision nuclease          involved in repair of UV damage to DNA The           uvrB and           uvrC genes fall in separate large          deleted regions between syntenic fragments whereas           uvrA is one of six genes deleted          within a syntenic region with the corresponding position          in           Buchnera occupied by a  bp          spacer Table           The most plausible interpretation of this pattern is          that some of these repair functions were initially lost          as the result of large deletions sometimes occurring in          combination with chromosomal rearrangements These          deletions were followed by gradual loss of other genes in          the same pathways The process of fixation of these large          deletions reflects not only selection on the repair          functions but also selection on other genes on the          deleted fragments A gene flanked by required loci is          less likely to be lost in an early large deletion than a          gene flanked by nonessential loci For example if the           kb segment containing           recA was lost as a single deletion          then the loss of           recA was dependent on the fact that          the neighboring genes included in the deletion were not          essential for survival The retention of           recBCD might have been promoted by           Buchnera s requirement for the          flanking gene           argA which encodes an enzyme for          biosynthesis of arginine Other smallgenome bacteria          lack           argA and other genes underlying          aminoacid biosynthesis whereas           Buchnera retains all genes required          for biosynthesis of essential amino acids which are          needed by the host          Many genes were lost singly implying insufficient          selection for conservation of individual genes A          consequence is the correlation in presenceabsence among          genes in the same pathway even if they occupy separate          locations on the chromosome if pathway function is lost          all genes in the pathway are invariably lost or degraded          An example in the case of the recombinase genes is the          loss of           recF which is required for some           recA functions   and which was          deleted individually with both flanking genes retained          Table  A plausible scenario for the loss of this          pathway is that once           recA was eliminated in the context          of a large deletion there was no selection for           recF retention and it was subject          to successive small deletions and substitutions In both           Buchnera of           A pisum and           Buchnera of           Schizaphis graminum recF is          replaced by  nucleotides with base composition           AT    The process of shrinkage and AT          accumulation could result strictly from mutational          patterns which are biased towards deletions   and          nucleotide substitutions ending in A or T                            Large deletions in other bacterial genomes          Genome comparisons across other groups of related          bacteria suggest that deletion events encompassing          multiple loci are frequent in bacterial evolution For          example deletions of over  kb and  loci have          occurred in natural isolates of           E coli that are very closely          related on the basis of sequence homology   On the          basis of comparison with its close relative           Mycobacterium tuberculosis M          leprae shows a pattern of genome reduction that          includes both loss of large fragments and also loss of          gene function through slight changes in sequence            Different strains of           M tuberculosis have been found to          contain at least  long deletions with one event          removing as many as  ORFs                            Consequences of genome reduction for gene          regulation          The changes in sequences underlying initiation of both          transcription and translation as well as the loss of          regulatory proteins   give an impression of          genomewide degeneration of regulatory functions in           Buchnera The hypothesized          elimination of promoters and genes seems to have produced          newly formed polycistronic regions Figure  The fusion          of genes into single transcriptional units has been          interpreted as the result of selection favoring small          genome size   or favoring efficiency in transcription          or translation   In           Buchnera however the hypothesized          loss of promoters suggests a general genomic decay          influencing transcriptional regulation this is supported          by the observation that SD sequences are also degenerate          and by the finding that some of the most frequently used          codons in the genome do not have corresponding tRNAs          because they have been deleted throughout           Buchnera s evolution Experiments          on gene expression patterns are needed to test the          potential deterioration of regulatory capabilities                            Conclusions                Buchnera provides the first case of a        fully sequenced highly reduced genome for which closely        related large genomes exist and have been sequenced        allowing reconstruction of the steps in genome reduction        The most plausible interpretation of the deletion of large        contiguous regions during the evolution of         Buchnera is that the transition to        the endosymbiotic lifestyle was accompanied or soon        followed by large deletions The location and content of        early deletions might well have shaped the ultimate gene        inventory of the fully reduced genome found in modern         Buchnera         The similarity in genome size across         Buchnera species   suggests that        most genome reduction occurred in the shared ancestral        lineage and that the ancestor of modern         Buchnera already had reached a        nearminimum size The extremely stable genome content of        modern         Buchnera is also indicated by        comparison of the full genome sequences of         Buchnera of         A pisum and         Buchnera of         Schizaphis graminum I Tamas         et al unpublished results        The ability to examine further why some genes are        retained and some are lost will be improved as additional        closely related genomes of different sizes are sequenced        and annotated The gamma Proteobacteria contain        freeliving bacteria with large genomes and also numerous        symbiotic lineages showing varying degrees of reduction in        genome size    With improved ability to reconstruct        ancestral genomes this group will provide an excellent        opportunity to determine the role of chance and selection        in the determination of genome content and in the evolution        of gene regulatory systems                    Materials and methods                  Reconstruction of the ancestor          Phylogenetic studies based on S rDNA sequences          indicate that           Buchnera belongs to the gamma          Proteobacteria and is closely related to           E coli Figure  The precise          phylogenetic position of           Buchnera has varied depending on          the method of analysis and the taxa included in the          analysis This instability is partially the result of the          accelerated evolution and AT bias that affect all           Buchnera genes including the S          rDNA   Most studies place           Buchnera either within or just          outside the Enterobacteriaceae suggesting that it          diverged near the time of the common ancestor of this          clade      Thus the reconstructed ancestor          of the clade corresponding to Enterobacteriaceae A in          Figure  was considered to constitute a close          approximation of the freeliving ancestor that gave rise          to           Buchnera           The genes absent from           Buchnera and present in           E coli include many that are          present in other related bacteria such as           Haemophilus influenzae and           V cholerae This supports the view          that           Buchnera was derived through loss          of genes from an ancestor similar to           E coli a conclusion also reached          by Shigenobu           et al   However some genes          were acquired recently by           E coli after divergence from the           Buchnera lineage   The          ancestral genome reconstruction was based on the           E coli MCl genome            following the removal of genes that seemed to have been          acquired after the           E coliBuchnera divergence The          rules for removing a gene were based on phylogenetic          distribution of orthologs among the unannotated genomes          of three serovars of           Salmonella enterica sv Typhi sv          Paratyphi and sv Typhimurium           Klebsiella pneumoniae and           Yersinia pestis and the annotated          genome of           V cholerae GenBank accession          number NC    The unpublished sequence data          were produced by the           Salmonella Klebsiella and           Yersinia Sequencing Groups at the          Sanger Centre for           S enterica sv Typhi           K pneumoniae and           Y pestis    and the          Washington University Genome Sequencing Center for           S enterica sv Typhimurium and           S enterica sv Paratyphi            Determination of phylogenetic distribution was based on          the Pipmaker analyses   for viewing orthology          among enteric and related bacteria as produced by          McClelland           et al    To qualify as an          ortholog to an           E coli gene a sequence had to          show at least  aminoacid identity for at least half          of the           E coli gene          Inclusion of a gene in the ancestor was not dependent          on its presence in all the descendant taxa as a gene          could be ancestral but lost from some lineages or          acquired after the ancestor but before divergence of some          descendant taxa Therefore to be retained in the          ancestor an ortholog had to be present in at least one          of the close relatives of           E coli            S enterica sv Paratyphi Typhi or          Typhimurium or           K pneumoniae  and also in at          least one of the more distant relatives either           Y pestis representing a more          basal branch of the Enterobacteriaceae or           V cholerae branching just outside          the Enterobacteriaceae These requirements effectively          impose a parsimony criterion minimizing the number of          gains and losses of genes This criterion is likely to be          valid for most genes across this relatively shallow          phylogeny Sequences most likely to be misrepresented in          the ancestor by this reconstruction are phage genes or          insertion elements which may move in and out of genomes          too frequently for ancestral states to be reconstructed          using parsimony           Buchnera lacks phage or insertion          sequences            The ancestor was assigned the gene order of modern           E coli Although this order is          almost certainly not entirely correct comparison with          other bacteria indicates that it is true for a majority          of the borders between the  fragments including those          lost and those retained For example the same linkages          occur in           E coli and           V cholerae andor           E coli and           Y pestis for  of the junctions          between fragments in           Buchnera example in Figure           This implies that most of the           E coli arrangements were present          in the ancestor of           Buchnera and           E coli and that the ends of          syntenic fragments mostly represent sites at which          rearrangements occurred in the evolution of           Buchnera A concentration of          rearrangements in the           Buchnera lineage is also suggested          by the much longer average length of spacers that occur          between syntenic fragments as compared to spacers that          have the same flanking genes in the ancestor and in           E coli see above This longer          spacer length can be interpreted as arising from remnants          of genes that were rendered functionless when          rearrangements occurred When the relevant genomes          currently in progress are complete and annotated a more          accurate reconstruction of ancestral gene order maybe          possible
