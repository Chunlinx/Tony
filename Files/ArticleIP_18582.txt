topick where it quotes Sen Ben Nighthorse Campbell Perhaps this quote shouldhave been offered without using the senators name because the remark wasapparently intended to be off the record The senator was complaining about thevery thing Plotz has now done getting a sound bite from a senator relievinghimself If Plotz did not get the senators permission to use the quote anapology may be in order

theissues involving Elia Kazans honorary Oscar  Jacob Weisberg perpetuatesthe myth that Hollywood has for decades been punishing Kazan by withholdinglaurels that would have been his had he not named names He deserves an Oscaras much as anyone livingfor best director not for best human being writesWeisberg But Kazan already has two Best Director Oscars including one forOn the Waterfront  the film in which he made his case for snitchingas Weisberg puts it He was also nominated for three other Academy Awards andhas won four Golden Globes three New York Film Critics Circle Awards and twoDirectors Guild Awards            Honorary a k a lifetimeachievement or deathbed Oscars are typically consolation prizes given topeople whose work was overlooked in its timesuch as Cary Grant Howard HawksFederico Fellini and Stanley Donen none of whom ever won a real Oscar Kazanwas a brilliant director but hes already been saluted for that so why givehim a lifetime achievement statue and not say John Ford or David LeanApparently Hollywood really does want to acknowledge that Kazan did the rightthing all those years ago And as Weisberg makes clear he did not                           DanielRadosh                        New York                           Scott Shuger IsTrippin                        Although Im certain it amused Scott Shuger anamusing guy to judge by the terrific Todays Papers to join the ranks ofthose who have publicly disparaged Linda Tripp the fact remains that nothingin his piece  reflects at all on Tripp herself            I cant help but wonder if Shuger thought to askhimself a few simple questions before launching his attack questions such asdid Tripp ask to be moved to her current job Was it her idea that she beplaced on leave and sent home to work Did Tripp have any input into thesalary for her current position If the job were held by someone other thanTripp would it pay any less or involve any more work            I suspect I know theanswers to these questions and I suspect Mr Shuger does as well In fact thesole purpose of his piece was to continue the media assault on Tripp as somekind of backstabbing dragon lady whom we should all view with disgust andloathing Well done Scott                           RussEvansen                        Madison Wis                           GordonianNot                        What a precious little
