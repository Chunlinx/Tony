        yes were going there     on our way   well uh this is a good topic for me because i just got off a jury on Friday   oh ill bet it is a good topic then   yeah have you ever been on a jury before   i have been on a jury once and it was an experience of a lifetime   uhhuh really what kind of a trial was it   it was just a it was like a civil suit um and i really felt that by the end of it i had no respect whatsoever for our jury system   uhhuh oh really what what did you think was wrong with it   yep it well we all had to agree it well we didnt all have to agree because it was a civil suit   uhhuh   ten out of twelve had to agree and we had like twelve questions and the exact same ten people had to agree on all twelve questions   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and thats really hard i mean we deliberated for  ten hours and that was a long time and people got  with each other and i mean it just was not a good situation   yeah wow yeah umhum hm thats interesting   well and you know by the end of it i didnt feel like anybody won i feel like we compromised  compromised until we got to the point that nobody won   really wow thats   what about yours   well ive been on two actually and the first one i was on was also a civil trial but it was real apparent to all of us what what the situation was so it was real simple   hm   um and we only deliberated as maybe three hours and we werent really deliberating we were reading through the whole charge and and trying to understand what the judge had written but i mean beyond that we really didnt have much debate um but the one i just got off of was capital murder trial   yeah oh wow   and uh that uh um i dont know if its fortunate or not i was an alternate so i sat through five days of the trial and its sort of like seeing five days of a movie and missing the last ten minutes because i dont know what happened yet   oh because you werent allowed to go into deliberations were you   and thats right thats right and they also they cant report it on TV or anything so i dont know you know until its completely over i wont know what happened   oh wow   so it was it was really interesting and and i can see   are are you real definite as to how you think you would have voted and everything   i i was leaning one way or another but i really needed to look at some of the evidence to make sure   umhum   but it it you know it was fairly clear and i talked to the judge afterwards and you know and knowing what i know know now which the other jurors didnt know id definitely convict the guy because he was he was found involved in two more of them and he was caught on the scene a the third one   oh wow   so it was it was fairly obvious you know that he had done it and eventually im sure one of the in one of the three trials theyll probably convict him if not the first but uh   but is this one the first   this is the first one they tried him on yes so it was it was   wow where are you from   um im in North Dallas where are you   oh okay Plano   oh okay well this happened in Plano  youll be thrilled to know     what trial are you talking about   excuse me   what trial are you talking about   um well the one i was involved was at uh Warehouse Beverage its on uh i think its Fifteenth and Avenue K and the one he was later involved in was the Texaco one   umhum umhum uhhuh   and i dont know what the third one was   oh my well ill have to watch the paper then when did they go into when did they go into deliberations   but the Texaco one yeah that on Friday but that was just the the guilt and innocence phase and i dont know you know then there is the punishment phase after that   oh now is the jury going to decide the punishment phase   um well all they can decide they dont really tell say we want capital punishment or we want something or life imprisonment you know if they find him guilty those are the two options for capital murder but they had six six choices what he was guilty of uh   umhum umhum   but all they can do there is three questions that they have to evaluate one being could he be a future threat to people well hes already proven that but you know a couple questions like that and your answers are yes or no and if you get i think it is three yeses its capital punishment   umhum   or you can decide if there is mitigating fact or something to that effect but its not like you go and say you know we we recommend this punishment you just say we answered these questions this way   wow and thats what it thats what it leads to   and it leads you to the punishment yeah   wow   so it was really interesting and i wish i knew if they were still in deliberations but i dont   um well it is it  when did you say it was Friday   so Friday they went into deliberations but i dont know if the press can report at the end of the  the guilt and innocence phase or if they have to wait until the whole punishment thing is over because that will take another couple weeks   Saturday Sunday Monday um i dont know wow   so but it was it was really interesting     so you enjoyed yours then   well i it i learned a lot what i didnt enjoy was not being able to plan anything in my whole life because i mean as far as i knew this could take months some of them do   right oh yeah some of them do   and that was the thing you know with Christmas and everything and i couldnt make reservations to go home but uh you know now that its over it was really interesting   who is the judge   um Nathan or Nathaniel White   Nathaniel
