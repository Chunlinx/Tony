                                 Black Was Beautiful            I walked through ManhattansEast Village the other day to see what people were wearing at the center ofbohemia these days I was immediately struck by the benign pastel tonality ofthe clothed population there seemed to be a large consensual flight from thecolor black that famous hue of communal refusal Instead everybody wasoffhandedly wearing an assortment of garments in pale colors as ifdeliberately refusing the highimpact selfaware look that black gear nowgives to modern urban life It seems that the bohemian spirit has gone beyondthe old war against palatable daylight hypocrisy waged in the costume of starkdark truth Once upon a time colorful clothing was the sign of unspeakablenaivet or ridiculous ostentation to be shunned in favor of black by allproperly bemused and detached critics of society Now its clearly lost itsenemy status With black so standard and so obvious colorespecially mildmuted faded thriftshop coloris no longer uncool            When Iwas a bohemian college student in New York only black was acutely coolbecause it was so hard to find Standard inexpensive clothes instoressweaters and skirts lets saycame in dark blue dark green andmaybe brown or maroon the traditional colors of country sportswear favored bythe Ivy League and in tweedy mixtures or pale versions of the same Sockstoo All this was excruciatingly uncool hopelessly demeaning You could get ablack dress or black suit for lots of money but that was only occasionallypermissible and mostly not possible and there were no thrift shops full ofinteresting castoffs Satisfactory rebel black had to be tracked down in placesthat specialized in dancers gear for example where you could find blacktights and turtlenecks or made at home during vacations I rememberconcocting many a funereal top and bottom and the occasional black cape on mysympathetic mothers sewing machine On a tight budget it required real effortto oppose the multicolored tacky assumptions of ordinary life in thosedays            In high Victorian times advanced feminine elegance wasdefined by a range of brilliant hues and nonfashionable clothing mostly bydull black Black was worn by mourners and the clergy by civil and domesticservants and by the poor as Sunday best The old social hierarchiesdisintegrated after World War I and boring nonfashion could becomerevolutionary high fashion Only then could Chanel daringly use dull blacktextiles until then associated with widows weeds and maids uniforms forplain but costly little dresses that made the contrived bright or pallid garbof the belle poque look foolish            Fashionable women discovered that simply cut garments in plain black fabricwere as flattering to them as evening clothes were to men Womens fashionhasnt been the same since and the feminine appeal of muted black clotheslater extended to menswear for women has kept its mainstream power That powerwas echoed in the rebellious bohemian version which inevitably became asizable fashion market itself and took over a large part of expensive chic Forthat very reason perhaps current urban opposition to the wholeimageconscious mainstream is veering over to what used to look like farmclothes the faded greenandyellowcheckered shirts and theorangewashedouttocoral sweatshirts of poor and artless rural life            Its hard to believe that bohemian black isgone for good because its prestige is so great Suggesting as it did theremote look of both the unworldly priesthood and the potent monastic ordersblack garb was often the antifashion choice of dandies and intellectuals ofHamlet the anxious prince Byron the smoldering poet and Baudelaire theaustere afflicted critic Black was also chosen by women who took their cuesfrom those men by austere anxious or smoldering femmes fatales  suchas George Sand who felt alone among their smugly blooming sex Many intensesolitary and impassioned heroines of fiction and history wearing blackdresses in illustrative art helped set the tone for hosts of moderntemptresses in black Intelligent unquiet black and sexy black have cometogether in modern womens fashion a black dress feels both safe anddangerous Chanel a child of poverty was very clever to allow for the senseof alienation in her chic black scheme            It wasBaldessare Castiglione in The Book of the Courtier  finished published  who first recommended black costume as a means of conveyingpersonal distinction and a certain noble reticence He offered this advice toboth sexes at a time when elaborate clothes in rich colors were prevalent amongthe mighty and many of them took it Much Renaissance and Baroque portraituredisplays its successful effect which has repeatedly inspired high and lowpractical elegance ever since Modern black sweaters and black leather jacketsblack tuxedoes and all degrees of black dcolletage are ultimately descendedfrom those great examples offered by Titian Velzquez Rembrandt et al ofthe extra impact delivered by any human face that appears above a blackcladbody Great photography indebted to Rembrandt and his successors continues tomake the point            Now everybody can do it and the fashion business hasapparently concluded that everybody will want to do it forever Designersattempts to eradicate the publics devotion to black clothes

minutes that modish black is over but it never isitsjust waiting            So far that is Given theaccumulated cultural force of its myriad uses in history you might predictthat the future of black clothing would be at least as long as its past Sincemodern black can be both high and low or right and left it seems too versatileto lose But all that might fall away Up to now the black printed type
