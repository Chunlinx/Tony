                    Background        It was originally thought that GPCRs and tyrosine kinase        receptors functioned independently to mediate different        signaling events but it has become clear in recent years        that some functions and signaling pathways are shared for        reviews see Marinissen and Gutkind      Luttrell             and van Biesen et al      For        example some classical neurotransmitters such as HT have        shortterm effects on ion channels and other effectors such        as adenylyl cyclase but also have growth factorlike        effects in developing brain    and mitogenic effects on        fibroblasts reviewed in Gerhardt and van Heerikhuizen             The peptide hormones insulin and IGF have        both shortterm metabolic effects and longterm actions on        cell growth and differentiation Insulin and IGFI bind and        stimulate tyrosine kinase receptors which interact with a        large number of effectors      Complex interactions        occur between these two types of signaling pathways that        are the subject of intense investigation        The HT         C receptor displays a heterogeneous        distribution in the CNS    and is not found in        peripheral tissues It is abundant in choroid plexus where        it modulates the production of cerebrospinal fluid CSF        and in limbic regions and hypothalamus where it may play a        role in motor behavior and appetite control The HT         C receptor has been implicated in        anxiety migraine movement disorders eating disorders and        neuroendocrine regulation     The importance of the        HT         C receptor in regulation of food intake        is evident in a knockout mouse developed by Tecott et al            The obesity found in these mice is due to excessive        food intake and this phenotype along with increased plasma        levels of insulin and leptin is analogous to Type         diabetes The knockout mouse is also susceptible to        epilepticlike seizures  suggesting that the HT         C receptor has a role in tonic        inhibition of neuronal excitability        HT         C receptors and insulinIGF receptors        share some functional roles both have trophic effects in        the brain and modulate appetite HT         C receptors    and insulinIGF        receptors    colocalize in several areas in the brain        including choroid plexus olfactory bulb cerebral cortex        hypothalamus and hippocampus Interactions between insulin        and serotonergic pathways may have important consequences        for their known roles in appetite modulation and trophic        actions in the brain We chose to look for these types of        interactions in choroid plexus because both HT         C receptors and insulinIGF receptors        are abundant in this tissue and because the HT         C receptor is the only HT receptor        present in these cells        The HT         C receptor is a member of the GPCR        family GPCRs stimulate heterotrimeric G proteins which        release activated G and G subunits to interact with a        variety of effectors The function of GPCRs is tightly        regulated by phosphorylation by second messenger activated        kinases protein kinase A and protein kinase C and G        proteincoupled receptorspecific kinases GRKs Arrestins        bind phosphorylated receptors and further downregulate        receptor activity by inhibiting G protein interaction It        is wellknown that GPCRs can regulate the activity of        tyrosine kinaseMAP kinase pathways However there is        little evidence for reciprocal regulation MAP kinase        effects on GPCR function Here we report such evidence         insulinmediated MAP kinase regulation of HT         C receptor activity                    Results                  Effect of insulin signaling on HT Creceptor          function in choroid plexus cells          We examined the effects of insulin signaling on HT           C receptor function in isolated rat          choroid plexus cells Activation of HT           C receptors in choroid plexus          stimulates phosphoinositol hydrolysis    and          increases intracellular calcium     We measured          changes in intracellular calcium in response to serotonin          HT with the calcium indicator fura A robust          increase in intracellular calcium was seen in response to          HT Fig aand c and this response could be          completely blocked with the selective HT           C receptor antagonist mesulergine          data not shown The response to HT was significantly          attenuated  inhibition when choroid plexus cells          were treated with insulin before superfusing serotonin          Fig band c Pretreatment with PD  a MEK          inhibitor blocked the inhibitory effect of insulin Fig          c but had no effect on the serotonin response when used          alone These data indicate that insulin inhibits HT           C receptor activity and MEK is an          obligatory component of insulins action implicating the          involvement of the MAP kinase pathway                          Characterization of the mechanism of insulins          effect on HT Creceptor function in Xenopus          oocytes          To delineate the mechanism of insulins action on the          HT           C receptor we used the           Xenopus oocyte expression system          Oocytes contain endogenous insulin and IGF receptors              They also have many of the proteins in the RAS and          MAP kinase pathways which have been implicated in cell          cycle control and reentry into meiosis      We          expressed two GPCRs a serotonin receptor HT           C  and an M muscarinic          acetylcholine Ach receptor Both receptors utilize G          proteins for signaling they stimulate phosphoinositide          hydrolysis and increased phospholipase C activity which          leads to transient activation of a Ca dependent Cl          current in the oocytes Activation of either receptor          can crossdesensitize the other suggesting that they          share the same G protein pathway          To determine the effect of insulin receptor or IGF          receptor activation on GPCRs cells were treated with          insulin or IGF The Cl currents elicited by subsequent          HT or Ach stimulation were compared with those without          insulinIGF treatment As shown in Fig  treatment          with insulin or IGF resulted in a significant reduction          of the peak Cl current in response to HT but did not          affect the response to Ach Insulin alone did not induce          an ionic current under these conditions data not shown          Insulin treatment did not affect the general          characteristics of the Cl current induced by HT or          Ach ie a depolarizing current with a rapid transient          peak and slower oscillatory phase Figs aand b top          Instead insulin specifically reduced the peak Cl          current in response to HT by  compared to untreated          controls    nA vs    nA Fig a middle          with no change in the magnitude of the Cl current in          response to Ach    nA vs    nA Fig          b middle Similar to the effect of insulin IGF          treatment specifically reduced the magnitude of the Cl          current in response to HT by     nA vs             nA Fig a bottom without affecting the          response to Ach    nA vs    Fig b          bottom These data indicate that the inhibitory effect          of insulinIGF is specific for the HT           C receptor          Insulin and IGF receptors activate several different          regulatory proteins including RAS MAP kinase PI          kinase S kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatase                Initiation of this transduction cascade requires          the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the          insulinIGF receptors To determine whether or not          tyrosine kinase activity was required for the action of          insulinIGF the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein          was used As shown in Fig a in oocytes pretreated with          genistein before IGF administration the reduction in          HTinduced Cl current was abolished whereas genistein          treatment alone had no effect on the HT response in          oocytes not treated with IGF          The insulinIGF pathway diverges into RASdependent          and independent paths To identify which path is          involved an antiRAS antibody that can neutralize RAS          activity was injected into oocytes before IGF          treatment This RAS antibody Y has been shown in          oocytes to block the reentry into meiosis or germinal          vesicle breakdown induced by IGF     Antibody          injection blocked the effect of IGF on the HT          response Fig b demonstrating that the inhibitory          effect of insulinIGF was RASdependent          RAS activates a cascade of kinases including RAF MAP          kinase kinase MEK and MAP kinase The involvement of          this pathway in regulation of HT receptor function was          examined Pretreating cells with PD  a specific          MEK kinase inhibitor     blocked the effect of IGF          on the HT response whereas inhibition of protein          kinase C did not Fig a These results suggest that          MEK is involved in mediating the inhibitory effect of the          insulinIGF pathway          MEKs primary role is activation of MAP kinase through          threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinase          which in turn phosphorylates and regulates the function          of several nuclear proteins such as transcription          factors as well as cytosolic and membraneassociated          proteins such as the insulin and EGF receptors To          determine whether MAP kinase is involved in mediating the          insulinIGF effect activated MAP kinase    was          injected into oocytes before testing the HT response          Active MAP kinase reduced the HT response by           compared to untreated controls Fig b demonstrating          that active MAP kinase is capable of mimicking the          inhibitory effect of insulinIGF on the HT           C receptor          The HT           C receptor contains a putative MAP          kinase site    at serine  in the second          intracellular loop between the rd and th transmembrane          domains To ascertain whether MAP kinase directly          modulates the receptor function this amino acid was          changed to alanine by sitedirected mutagenesis As shown          in Fig c insulin no longer inhibited the peak Cl          current activated by the mutant receptor SA          indicating that serine  is likely the site of MAP          kinase modulation                            Discussion        The HT         C receptor is a member of the G        proteincoupled receptor superfamily and one of over         cloned serotonin receptors Except for the HT          receptor which is an oligomeric ion        channel all serotonin receptors are GPCRs and are divided        into seven subfamilies based on sequence homology gene        structure and signaling pathways      The HT         C receptor like other members of the        HT          family stimulates phospholipase C        and increases IP          and DAG which leads to increased        intracellular calcium and mediates many cellular processes        In general HT          receptor types are growthregulatory        and stimulate cell division However unlike the HT         A    and HT         B    receptors the HT         C receptor is not known to activate MAP        kinase The HT         C receptor activates multiple signal        transduction cascades         in vivo and in heterologous        expression systems see Raymond et al      and        Gerhardt and van Heerikhuizen       for reviews        In choroid plexus the HT         C receptor stimulates PI turnover        increases cGMP formation and activates Cl channels In        heterologous expression systems the HT         C receptor can couple to two different        K channels    and in some cases either activation or        inactivation of adenylyl cyclase has been demonstrated in        addition to the wellknown activation of phospholipase C        and PI turnover        The regulation of the HT         C receptor has been the focus of        several studies but the results have been difficult to        interpret for several reasons including the complex        pharmacology of this receptor The presence of spare HT         C receptors    in choroid plexus        has also complicated the study of desensitization         in vivo  However it has been        demonstrated that denervation of HT neurons        supersensitizes HT         C receptors    in choroid plexus        suggesting that these receptors are under tonic control by        HT In primary cultures of choroid plexus cells repeated        HT application desensitizes HT induced increases in        intracellular calcium     Downregulation of receptor        binding sites in choroid plexus cells is seen after agonist        treatment     However inverse agonists can either        down    or upregulate    HT         C receptor binding sites dependent upon        cellular context The mechanisms underlying desensitization        or downregulation of the HT         C receptor are unknown but these        reports suggest finely tuned control of HT         C receptor function and density        Several studies have utilized heterologous expression        systems to identify mechanisms of HT         C receptor regulation Phosphorylation        most likely has a prominent role in regulation of the HT         C receptor Westphal and colleagues           demonstrated that the HT         C receptor exhibits basal        phosphorylation and that agonist treatment was associated        with increased phosphorylation and receptor desensitization        in transfected cells The expressed HT         C receptor exhibits homologous and        heterologous desensitization in oocytes    mediated by        protein kinase C       A calmodulindependent        kinase may also be involved in homologous desensitization            In contrast a recent study indicates that neither        PKC nor calmodulindependent protein kinase II are        involved instead desensitization of the HT         C receptor is dependent on GRK activity            Interestingly tyrosine kinase involvement in the        agonistmediated phosphorylation of the rat HT         C receptor has also been reported            although as yet no report has shown that the HT         C receptor directly activates tyrosine        kinases        The HT         C receptors are subject to another form        of regulation by means of mRNA editing     RNA editing           is a type of posttranscriptional modification that        occurs when doublestranded RNA deaminase converts        genomically coded adenosines to inosines thereby changing        the coding sequence of specific RNA transcripts RNA        editing of the rat HT         C receptor was first described by Burns        et al    and editing at four nucleotide sites alters        three amino acids within the second intracellular loop RNA        editing of the HT         C receptor is conserved among species           and at least  major isoforms with tissuespecific        expression patterns have been described in rat brain           suggesting a functional importance The mouse cDNA clone        used in our study codes for the fully edited form        ValSerVal of the receptor The putative MAP        kinase site Ser we identified and mutated in this        study is also a site of mRNA editing in this receptor ie        Ser is only present in edited forms The fully edited        rat HT         C receptor exhibits reduced agonist        efficacy or ability to interact with G proteins compared to        the unedited receptor IleAsnIle in transfected        cells     Interestingly HT elicits a larger        response see Fig c in cells expressing the mutant        receptor SA compared to the fully edited mouse        receptor and the mutant receptor is not regulated by        insulin Binding of radiolabelled mesulergine was similar        in the edited HT         C and SA mutant receptors in        transfected cells data not shown These results suggest        some intriguing possibilities Either the mutant receptor        SA couples more readily to G proteins compared to the        fully edited HT         C receptor or the edited Ser        containing receptor may be phosphorylated to some extent        in the basal state We hypothesize that the phosphorylated        receptor may couple less efficiently to G proteins but        this hypothesis remain to be tested Our results indirectly        suggest that HT         C receptors containing Ser may be        subject to yet another form of regulation ie        phosphorylation by MAP kinase        The HT         C receptor is very abundant in choroid        plexus      and is the only HT receptor present on        these cells Choroid plexus cells line the cerebral        ventricles form the bloodCSF barrier and are responsible        for the production of cerebrospinal fluid CSF            Although the mechanisms have not been delineated the HT         C receptor is thought to regulate CSF        production and the expression of transferrin For example        upon intraventricular injection HT         C agonists decrease the production of        CSF    and in primary cultures of choroid plexus HT        agonists increase the expression of transferrin             an iron carrier protein which has trophic effects on the        brain In addition choroid plexus expresses insulin        IGFI and IGFII receptors      as well as large        amounts of IGFII that is secreted into the CSF            CSF contains insulinIGFs and HT    in concentrations        high enough to activate their respective receptors in        choroid plexus suggesting that this signaling mechanism        may occur         in vivo  It has been suggested that        HT         C receptors in choroid plexus may be        tonically activated due to CSF HT concentrations near        the EC           thus tonically inhibiting CSF        production Our data suggest that insulin may reduce HT         C receptor activity thereby increasing        CSF production and decreasing transferrin production As a        consequence insulin inhibition of HT         C receptor activity may change the        volume and composition of CSF and indirectly may alter the        concentrations of many potentially important signaling        molecules in CSF        MAP kinase regulation is potentially an important        mechanism of modulating GPCR function however the        prevalence of this type of modulation is unknown Our        results suggest that the HT         C receptor is a MAP kinase substrate        whereas the M Ach receptor is not The optimal consensus        site for MAP kinase phosphorylation isProXSerThrPro        however in some cases the upstream Pro is not required and        a minimal sequence of SerPro or ThrPro is phosphorylated        for review see Davis      The HT         C receptor site is just such a minimal        sequence of SerPro and it is the only MAP kinase site we        identified within the receptors presumed intracellular        domains This site is not conserved within the M Ach        receptor or other HT          type receptors Although all of these        receptors contain SerPro or ThrPro sequences within        intracellular domains it is difficult to determine the        importance of these sites For example despite the fact        that insulin did not inhibit Ach receptor signaling in our        experiment the rat M Ach receptor contains several MAP        kinase sites including one ThrPro sequence in the         ndintracellular loop and  SerPro and one ThrPro in the         rdintracellular loop The reason for this apparent        discrepancy is unclear but may be related to a spare        receptor phenomenon in the oocyte expression system        Alternatively additional sequence or regulatory elements        which have not been identified may be required for MAP        kinase phosphorylation Determining the prevalence and        specificity of MAP kinase modulation of GPCRs will await        future studies                    Conclusions        Taken together our results demonstrate that        insulinIGF signaling downregulates HT         C receptor function in choroid plexus        and         Xenopus oocytes via MAP kinase and        that the HT         C receptor is a substrate for MAP        kinase To our knowledge this is the first description of        MAP kinase regulation of a GPCR and suggests that this form        of regulation may be more widespread than has been        previously recognized Furthermore since some GPCRs can        modulate MAP kinase activity MAP kinase regulation of GPCR        function may then serve as a form of negative feedback        control in much the same way that protein kinase A protein        kinase C and the G proteincoupled receptor kinases GRKs        regulate GPCRs                    Methods                  Chemicals and Reagents          Cell culture reagents and enzymes

         The putative MAP kinase site on the HT           C receptor serine  was mutated          to alanine by PCR with primers containing an alanine          codon at the place for serine  The PCR product was          subcloned into the same vector as the wildtype HT           C receptor and the mutation          confirmed by DNA sequencing                            Authors contributions
