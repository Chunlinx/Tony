                                  Do Nothing Congress            Its not an idea that comes easily to this town ofmovers and shakers but in the nations capital a potentially powerfulinterest group is coalescing behind the cause of  doing nothing            Not nothing in thepersonal sense of course Nothing Caucus members go about their daily businessjust like anyone else walking the dog driving to work thinking big thoughtsmaking big deals whatever What unites them is their belief that the nationsinterests would best be served if Congress would just pack it in            The guiding principle behind the movement was perhaps firstarticulated by that preeminent oracle on things economic Federal ReserveChairman Alan Greenspan Given the current exuberant state of the Americaneconomy he told a Senate committee back in January that his preferred use ofany surplus in the federal budget would be to retire the federal debt WithUS personal savings running in the negative range net investment by the richbeing more than offset by borrowing by the masses and America ever moredependent on borrowing private capital from abroad Greenspan concluded itwould be prudent for Uncle Sam to do a little saving for us And of courseusing surplus federal funds to buy back outstanding Treasury bonds and notesfrees up private capital for other investment            Understand that anymoney left over in the general fund ie money not earmarked for SocialSecurity is automatically invested in Treasury bonds Since the Treasury wouldnot in that case need to do any new borrowing those bonds would have to bebought back from the public and retired The same is true of the SocialSecurity trust fundsbut only as long as the rest of government is in theblack which it hasnt been for decades Otherwise the payroll tax surplusesare used to cover borrowing done to finance courts prisons schools airportsweather forecasts and all the other things that government does So whatGreenspan is hoping is that Congress will allocate no more for new tax cuts orspending than it can cover with the remaining taxes            Greenspan didnt spell out how he hoped that would beaccomplished But other budget watchers from both parties have comeincreasingly to the view that when it comes to direct action by Congress lessis more We get to talking about the donothing Congress as a bad thing butlook at the alternatives says Republican Carol Cox Wait president of theCommittee for a Responsible Budget Wait points to last years lastminute billionplus emergency supplemental as a prime example of what Congress doeswhen its under pressure to do something Former Congressional Budget OfficeDirector Robert Reischauer a Democrat agrees The salvation of the nationmay be in gridlock says Reischauer Its dangerous to let a preelectionCongress play with tax and entitlement legislation in a surplusenvironment            Thats especially sowhen those surpluses are as incorporeal as Macbeths dagger Calculations byboth private and official sources show that the existence of any yearsurplus in the nonSocial Security part of the budget depends upon a fictionIt is that this and future Congresses and presidents will agree to cut domesticand military spending other than entitlements by some  percent over thenext  years That fiction is embodied in the  balanced budget agreementboth Clinton and congressional leaders endorsed two years ago The act sets alimit on socalled discretionary spending both domestic and military for nextyear that is lower than current spending The limits are even lower in thefollowing two years Both the Congressional Budget Office and the Office ofManagement and Budget are required to assume the limits will actually be metwhen they make their projections a point generally overlooked Budgetwatchers noted at the time the caps were enacted that they were absurdlyunrealistic but the caution was lost in the general celebration            Now even highly placed Clinton administration officialssecretly subscribe to stalemate It wont be the end of the world said onelast week Its not a bad outcome But comments such as this are strictly notfor attribution True when pressed top economic advisers have called thespending caps totally unrealistic but they are loath to press this point tooloudly lest it call into question both their own plans for additionalinvestments read spending and tax breaks and the presidents embrace of thelimits in the first place That coyness led the White House to issue a budgetthat by assuming the caps would be effective showed the year  trilliongeneral fund surplus that triggered the current orgy on Capitol Hill            House Republicans led offthe festivities last week by passing The Financial Freedom Act Thiseffusively named tax cut would even after some cosmetic improvements toplacate fiscal conservatives likely absorb more than the total yearsurplus That includes interest costs on the extra debt the Treasury willincur if it doesnt buy back outstanding securities The measure is artfullyconstructed to hide its full cost bigticket items such as repeal of theestate tax and the alternative minimum tax and acrosstheboard rate cutsarent fully phased in until  The administration now calculates that overthe following  years the tax cut will cost some  trillionthis just atthe time that retiring baby boomers are starting to drain the Social Securitysurpluses            Of course both the president and the GOP leadership havepiously embraced the notion of a lockbox for the trust fund surpluses buteach doubts the strength of the others padlock construction And with goodreason There is no box that Congress with the acquiescence of the WhiteHouse cannot unhinge in the dead of an October night when the budget isfinally nailed together Remember that any overspending in the general budgetautomatically results in borrowing from the trust fundsand that Congressdespite its lip service to the spending caps and the surpluses that dependentirely upon them is even now busy marking up appropriations bills thatexceed the caps by tens of billions of dollars            Consciously aiming for stalemate would not beacceptable to Congress Ever since Harry Truman mocked the donothingCongress our nations representatives have been sensitive to charges thattheir time is spent only in pandering politicking and pot thumping And noone is suggesting that legislators pack up and go home forthwith That wouldmake for a mighty dull summer for us news junkies But after the requisitebarbtrading with the White House and a muchphotographed round ofnegotiations in which the sanctity of Social Security and the need to invest inour nations children are duly invoked it would be a blessing if Congresswould quietly pass a continuing resolution keeping spending more or less whereit currently is and then take to the hustings where each party can blame theother for doing whats best for the countrynothing
