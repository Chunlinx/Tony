                    Background        In the budding yeast         Saccharomyces cerevisiae  the        mitotic exit network MEN plays a pivotal role in driving        cells from mitosis to G Identified components of the MEN        include Tem a GTPbinding protein Lte a putative        guanine nucleotide releasing factor Nud a        spindlepolebody protein Cdc a protein kinase        DbfMob a protein kinase complex Cdc a Pololike        protein kinase and Cdc a protein phosphatase When        cells harboring conditionallethal temperaturesensitive        ts mutations in any of these proteins are shifted to the        restrictive temperature they uniformly arrest in late        anaphase as largebudded cells with segregated chromosomes        fully elongated microtubule spindles and in all tested        cases elevated CdcClb protein kinase activity Cdc        is the major cyclindependent kinase Cdk and Clb the        major mitosisspecific cyclin of budding yeast reviewed        in                The protein phosphatase Cdc is likely to be the most        downstream element in the MEN because it can act directly        on cell cycle regulators to promote exit from mitosis By        counteracting Cdkmediated phosphorylations Cdc        activates both HctCdh which targets Clb for        degradation       and Swi which turns on the        transcription of Cdk inhibitor Sic      Degradation        of Clb and accumulation of Sic act in concert to        eliminate mitotic Cdk activity which is required for exit        from mitosis     Thus elucidating how Cdc is        regulated holds the key to understanding how cells exit        mitosis In preanaphase cells Cdc is confined to the        nucleolus as a subunit of the RENT complex which also        contains NetCfi and Sir and its phosphatase activity        is inhibited by Net        Damaged DNA and        misoriented mitotic spindles delay exit from mitosis        reviewed in     but after errors have been rectified        or bypassed Lte Nud and possibly other unidentified        factors    promote Tem activation Tem recruits Cdc        to the spindle pole body which in turn recruits and        phosphorylates the DbfMob protein kinase complex        thereby switching it on         The        Temsignaling pathway eventually triggers disassembly of        the RENT complex enabling the release of Cdc and a        portion of Sir from Net Active Cdc diffuses into the        nucleus and cytoplasm to extinguish mitotic Cdk activity        and to promote exit from mitosis        The relative position of the Pololike kinase Cdc in        the MEN is obscure Cdc is required for full activation of        the DbfMob protein kinase complex       and has        been proposed to impinge on the MEN both upstream and        downstream of Tem        During exit from        mitosis Cdc is required for Clb destruction and similar        to overexpression of Cdc     induction of Cdc        triggers precocious Clb degradation in preanaphase cells             In addition to its role in exit from mitosis        Cdc has other functions during mitosis in budding yeast        Depletion of Cdc or Pololike kinase in         cdc cells arrests a significant        fraction of the cells in early anaphase with short mitotic        spindles      and phosphorylation of the cohesin        subunit Scc by Cdc enhances the efficiency of Scc        cleavage by the separase Esp during the metaphase to        anaphase transition            Although many proteins are known to be essential for        exit from mitosis the factor that sets Cdc free from the        nucleolus still remains elusive In this study we assess        the roles of Cdc in disassembly of the RENT complex and        exit from mitosis                    Results                  Release of Cdc from the nucleolus in late          anaphase requires Cdc          In           S cerevisiae  disassembly of the          RENT complex and the subsequent release of Cdc from the          nucleolus drive cells to exit mitosis      This          event is thought to require two independent signals an          unknown mitosisspecific signal and a signal from the          mitotic exit network MEN proteins including Tem          Cdc and Dbf      The Pololike kinase Cdc also          belongs to the MEN thus we tested whether it too is          required for release of Cdc from the nucleolus by using          indirect immunofluorescence to compare Cdc localization          patterns in wild type and           cdc cells Wild type cells with          short spindles were in preanaphase and showed focal          nucleolar Cdc staining and those with elongated          mitotic spindles were in late anaphase and showed          diffused Cdc staining Figure  Rows  and                In contrast           cdc cells uniformly exhibited          focal Cdc staining whether they were grown          exponentially at permissive temperature C or          arrested in late mitosis at nonpermissive temperature          C Figure  Rows  and  Furthermore in all          including late anaphase           cdc cells Cdc colocalized          with A a nucleolar protein Figure  Rows  and           suggesting that when           CDC is compromised most or all          Cdc fails to vacate the nucleolus in late anaphase                          Overexpression of Cdc evicts Cdc from the          nucleolus          To identify candidate proteins that directly disrupt          the RENT complex we examined whether overexpression of          the MEN proteins could release Cdc from the nucleolus          We first tested Cdc because Cdc is required for Cdc          release Figure  and because overexpression of Cdc          triggers ectopic degradation of Clb      which          normally depends upon active Cdc     These          experiments employed a           GALCDCDB strain in which          expression of CdcDB a stabilized version of Cdc          lacking the destruction box was driven by the inducible           GAL promoter     Cells were          arrested in G by factor supplemented with galactose          to induce the           GAL promoter and released into          galactosecontaining medium Cdc was focal in almost          all cells with short mitotic spindles but became          diffused in a significant fraction of these cells after          CdcDB was induced Figure A A similar result was          obtained if the total number of cells with diffused Cdc          was plotted instead data not shown To address whether          overexpression of Cdc could also force Cdc out of the          nucleolus in cells arrested at a cell cycle stage where          Cdc is nucleolar we arrested cells in metaphase using          the microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodazole          After the expression of CdcDB was induced in          nocodazolearrested cells Cdc diffused beyond the          domain of Net in  of cells Figure B In contrast                    GAL driven overexpression of          DbfGSTMob protein kinase complex did not dislodge          Cdc from the nucleolus data not shown Taken          together these data suggest that overexpression of Cdc           but not the putative downstreammost MEN component          DbfMob  activates premature release of Cdc from the          nucleolus                          Cdc influences the phosphorylation state of Net          in vivo          Because the overexpression studies implicated Cdc as          a promising candidate for participating directly in          disassembly of the RENT complex we evaluated further          whether the phosphorylation state of Net was affected by          Cdc NetMyc from a           cdc culture at C          nonpermissive temperature was hyperphosphorylated and          migrated slower in SDSPAGE    than that from          identically treated wildtype or           cdc cultures Figure  compare          Lane  with Lanes  and  Furthermore this          hyperphosphorylation of Net in           cdc cells was significantly          reduced upon simultaneous inactivation of           CDC Figure  compare Lanes  and           suggesting that Cdc is at least partially          responsible for the phosphorylation state of Net in late          mitosis          Our analysis of Cdcs role in release of Cdc from          the RENT complex revealed that Cdc is required for          disassembly of RENT in late anaphase that Cdc can          provoke premature disassembly of RENT in preanaphase          cells and that Cdc controls at least in part the          phosphorylation state of Net during anaphase Moreover          the arrest of           cdc            cdc            cdc  and           cdc temperaturesensitive          mutants in late mitosis was potently suppressed by the           TAB allele Park et al          submitted which encodes a form of Cdc that binds          weakly to Net and is released from Net during mitosis          even in the absence of MEN function     Taken          together these data suggested the hypothesis that           cdc mutants arrest in late          anaphase because inadequate Cdcdependent          phosphorylation of Net results in failure to release          active Cdc from the RENT complex                          Pololike kinases can disrupt the RENT complex in          vitro          Both Net and Cdc are extensively phosphorylated by          Cdc           in vitro Figure A To test if          Cdc could dislodge Cdc from Net we devised a          simplified           in vitro release assay using          GSTCdc and HisTNetN expressed and purified from          bacteria NetN includes the Nterminal  amino acids          of Net and is sufficient to bind and inhibit Cdc              When GSTCdcHisTNetN complex anchored to          antiT beads was treated with ATP plus increasing          amounts of recombinant Cdc purified from insect cells          both Cdc and NetN were phosphorylated as indicated by          their increased apparent molecular weight Furthermore          Cdc was released from beadbound NetN to the          supernatant Figure A and free Cdc was active as a          protein phosphatase data not shown suggesting that          Cdc is sufficient to disengage active Cdc from          Net          The essential functions of Cdc can be performed by          mammalian Pololike kinase Plk     which led us to          test if Cdc can also be substituted by other Pololike          kinases in the release assay HisTNetNGSTTCdc          complex was assembled on antiGST beads and treated with          either active or NA kinaseinactive Plx Pololike          kinase from           Xenopus      in the presence          of ATP Active but not inactive Plx phosphorylated both          NetN and Cdc and completely dislodged NetN from          beadbound Cdc Figure B Thus we conclude that like          Cdc the protein kinase activity of Plx can disrupt the          interaction between NetN and Cdc Because recombinant          Plx but not Cdc was consistently expressed at high          levels in insect cells and because release assays using          Plx and Cdc yielded similar results we used Plx in          most of our release assays          The NetNCdc complex is only a crude approximation          of RENT because it does not contain all components of          RENT such as Sir lacks modifications which normally          occur in yeast cells and contains NetN instead of Net          Thus we tested whether Pololike kinases could disrupt a          physiological RENT complex MycNet and the associated          RENT subunits were immunopurified from extracts of           mycNET cells on E beads and          treated with Plx plus ATP Active but not inactive Plx          released a significant portion of Cdc and Sir from          beadbound Net to the supernatant fraction Figure C          In a similar experiment Cdc also disrupted the RENT          complex data not shown Taken together these data          suggest that Pololike kinases are sufficient to release          Cdc and Sir from Net           in vitro                           Pololike kinase abolishes Cdcbinding activity          of Net in vitro          Pololike kinases phosphorylated and disrupted          NetNCdc complex raising the question whether          disassembly of the complex           in vitro required phosphorylation          of NetN or Cdc or both To address this question we          tested the binding affinity of combinations of          Plxphosphorylated or unphosphorylated NetN and Cdc          Unmodified NetN bound equally well to beads harboring          phosphorylated or unphosphorylated Cdc Figure  Lanes           and  respectively To the contrary phosphorylated          NetN remained in the supernatant Figure  Lanes  and           and failed to bind to Cdc beads Figure  Lanes           and  Thus we surmise that Pololike kinase          disassembles RENT           in vitro by eliminating the          Cdcaffinity of Net                          RENT complexes comprised of Net phosphosite          mutants are resistant to disassembly by Pololike kinase          but exhibit only minor phenotypes in vivo          If Cdc disassembled the RENT complex through          phosphorylating Net then a mutant Net lacking Cdc          phosphorylation sites should bind Cdc even in the          presence of active CdcPololike kinase To test this          hypothesis we prepared NetN phosphorylated by Cdc           in vitro  and mapped  definitive          and more than  potential phosphorylation sites using          mass spectrometry which is described in detail elsewhere                       We constructed an extensive set of phosphosite          mutants of NetN which were tested for their ability to          remain bound to Cdc beads in the presence of Plx              By successively combining individual mutations in          Cdc phosphorylation sites we created the phosphosite          mutants NetNm with S S S S S S          and S all changed to A and NetNm with T          S S S S S T T T T S          S S S S S S T S all          changed to A NetNm contained mutations required to          strongly inhibit Plxdependent disruption of NetNCdc          complexes whereas NetNm contained additional          mutations without compromising the affinity of NetN to          Cdc     Both of these mutant proteins when          expressed in           E coli and assembled with          recombinant Cdc were found to be severely defective in          releasing Cdc upon treatment with Plx data not          shown          To evaluate the effects of the Netm and Netm          mutants           in vivo  DNA fragments encoding          either the wild type or the mutant           NETN alleles were subcloned into a                    TRP marked integrating plasmid to          generate fulllength           NETmyc L           netmmyc L and           netmmyc L plasmids          respectively which were then integrated into the           TRP locus of           net diploid yeast cells After          sporulation           net NETmyc net          netmmyc  and           net netmmyc strains were          obtained and analyzed          First we compared           in vivo phosphorylation states of          Net and Netm Net and Netm from asynchronously          growing cells migrated identically in an          SDSpolyacrylamide gel Figure  Lanes  and           Netm from           cdc cells arrested at C          appeared to migrate slightly faster than the          corresponding Net Figure  compare Lanes  and  and          the reduced mobility of Netm in           cdc cells was no longer dependent          upon           CDC compare lanes  and           Netm behaved identically to Netm in this assay          data not shown We conclude that there is diminished          Cdcdependent phosphorylation of Netm in           cdc cells arrested in          anaphase          Next we asked if the mutant RENT complex is more          resistant toward Plx RENT complexes from           net NETmyc and           net netmmyc cell lysates          were captured on E beads and treated with increasing          amounts of recombinant Plx plus ATP Whereas  of          Cdc was released from wildtype RENT complex in the          presence of  l of Plx less than  of Cdc was          released from mutant RENT complex when treated with  l          of Plx Figure A Thus the mutant RENT is at least          fold more resistant to Plx than wildtype RENT RENT          complexes comprising Netm yielded nearly identical          results data not shown          Despite the striking defects of the phosphosite mutant          proteins           in vitro  neither           netmmyc nor           netmmyc cells expressed a          dramatic phenotype We observed that  of           netmmyc and           netmmyc cells with long          mitotic spindles showed focal ie nucleolar Cdc          localization compared to  of wild type cells Figure          B However this result indicates that the majority            of           net phosphositemutant cells          released Cdc from the nucleolus during anaphase with          normal kinetics Indeed the kinetics of cell cycle          progression monitored by either elongation of the          mitotic spindle or delocalization of Cdc from the          nucleolus in the wildtype and the           netm mutant strains were almost          identical Figure C          While this manuscript was under consideration Cdc          was shown to be involved in promoting Cdc early          anaphase release FEAR     FEAR is a transient          phenomenon that depends on Cdc but does not depend upon          other components of the MEN pathway It was reported that          in early anaphase Cdc is transiently released from the          nucleolus by the action of the FEAR pathway but quickly          returns to the nucleolus unless the MEN is activated to          promote sustained release of Cdc and subsequent exit          from mitosis To evaluate whether the           netm and           netm phosphosite mutants have          an impact on FEAR we analyzed Cdc localization in          synchronous populations of           dbf            netm dbf and           netm dbf cells following          release from an factor block in G phase at C to          factorfree medium prewarmed to C nonpermissive          temperature for           dbf  As shown in Figure D          the percentage of cells that completely released Cdc          during early anaphase spindle length  m was reduced          by  in           netm and  in           netm cells compared with          wildtype cells          To test for the possibility that the proteins encoded          by           netm and           netm might be hypomorphic          with respect to their resistance toward phosphorylation          by Cdc ie not all Cdc phosphorylation sites on Net          were mapped and mutated we evaluated whether the           net phosphositemutants exhibited          a synthetic growth phenotype when combined with           msd a mutant allele of           CDC  This experiment was based          on the idea that a reduction in phosphorylation sites on          Net coupled with a reduction in Cdc activity might          synergize to prevent efficient release of Cdc during          anaphase resulting in failure to exit mitosis The           netm but not           netm allele showed a synthetic          growth defect when combined with           msd Figure E The           netm allele also showed a          synthetic growth defect when combined with           dbf  These observations imply          that some of the residues mutated in           netm represent           in vivo phosphorylation sites that          influence the MENdependent release of Cdc during          anaphase                            Discussion                  Cdc participates in disassembly of the RENT          complex during anaphase                    CDC was originally discovered as a          gene essential for exit from mitosis     We found          that Cdc was required to release Cdc from the          nucleolus           cdc cells in late anaphase          displayed focal nucleolar Cdc staining whether grown          at the permissive or restrictive temperature By          contrast Cdc was released from the nucleolus in the          great majority of wild type cells by late anaphase          Surprisingly           cdc cells grown at C could          exit mitosis despite persistent nucleolar localization of          Cdc which may have been due to release of a small          fraction of Cdc that was nevertheless sufficient to          drive exit from mitosis in these cells Alternatively it          is possible that complete release of Cdc from the          nucleolus in           cdc cells was so brief that it          escaped our detection A ramification of this observation          is that indirect immunofluorescence assays based on Cdc          localization may not correctly predict whether a cell can          exit mitosis          Not only was Cdc required for Cdc release but a          stabilized mutant lacking the destruction box CdcDB          triggered inappropriate Cdc release in preanaphase          cells when overexpressed from the           GAL promoter Ectopic release          of Cdc might contribute to the proliferation block and          Clb degradation caused by induction of           GALCDCDB               Overexpression of CdcDB also altered nucleolar          structure in nocodazolearrested cells Figure B the          reason for which is not understood In contrast           GAL mediated overexpression of          Tem R Li personal communication Cdc     or          DbfGSTMob RA unpublished data had little or no          detectable effect on either exit from mitosis or cell          proliferation suggesting that the TemCdcDbfMob          branch of the MEN plays a more restricted role in          promoting the exit from mitosis          The observations that Cdc was both necessary and          sufficient for Cdc release and that Cdc influenced          phosphorylation state of Net           in vivo prompted us to examine          whether Cdc directly catalyzes disassembly of the RENT          complex Indeed Cdc and the           Xenopus pololike kinase Plx          reduced the binding affinity between recombinant Cdc          and Net by phosphorylating Net and dislodged both          Cdc and Sir from the RENT complex           in vitro                           Net mutants lacking critical Cdc phosphorylation          sites support normal progression through mitosis          If Cdc directly promotes disassembly of RENT           in vivo by a mechanism similar to          that observed           in vitro  then a Net mutant that          cannot be phosphorylated by Cdc should not allow release          of Cdc from the nucleolus in anaphase cells To address          this prediction we mapped           in vitro Cdcphosphorylation sites          in the Nterminal part of Net which is sufficient to          bind and inhibit Cdc     The details of this study          are described elsewhere     Among the thirty or so          mapped sites with some being more efficiently          phosphorylated than others no strict consensus sequence          for Cdc phosphorylation could be derived However the          data from this and other     studies suggest a          clear preference for phenyl or aliphatic side chains F          Y L I V M in the  position          Mutating all mapped phosphorylation sites was ruled          out as being uninformative because a Net mutant lacking           sites Netm already suffered significantly          reduced binding affinity for Cdc data not shown          Thus we prioritized phosphosites based on their          stoichiometry of phosphorylation and on homology to sites          whose phosphorylation was demonstrated to be important in          earlier release assays In total we tested more than           phosphosite mutants of Net and identified two           Netm and Netm  that still bound Cdc          normally but displayed a strong defect in releasing          Cdc upon treatment with Plx Full length           netmmyc and           netmmyc alleles were          constructed and expressed in           net background Mutant RENT          complexes retrieved from these cells were significantly          more resistant to the Pololike kinase Plx in release          assays Fig Aand data not shown However when           netm and           netm cells were evaluated by          immunofluorescence the majority released Cdc in late          anaphase and the subset that exhibited a modest delay in          Cdc mobilization probably released enough Cdc to exit          mitosis in a timely manner such that essentially no cell          cycle progression defect was evident Fig C In          addition Cdc remained nucleolar in           cdc net netmmyc cells          data not shown suggesting that the release event was          still regulated properly                          How does Cdc promote disassembly of the RENT          complex and exit from mitosis          There are two extreme interpretations of our analysis          of the Netm and Net m mutants First Cdc is          not directly involved in disrupting the RENT complex and          second Cdc directly disassembles the RENT complex via          phosphorylation of Net but because it is not feasible          to evaluate all possible    combinations of          phosphosite mutants or because the sites phosphorylated          by Cdc           in vivo are different from those           in vitro due to the presence of          factors such as Sir Pol I and rDNA      we          missed key phosphorylation sites that would have given a          more definitive phenotype when mutated A variation on          this theme is that it might never be possible to          construct a phosphosite mutant of Net that binds Cdc          but fails to release it during anaphase if the hydroxyl          groups that are phosphorylated normally form critical          hydrogen bonds that tether Cdc to Net          A third hypothesis that stakes middle ground between          these polar extremes is that Cdc affects RENT stability          both directly and indirectly with the former role being          less significant than the latter Several lines of          evidence are consistent with this view First           netm and           netm mutants exerted a modest          effect on release of Cdc from the nucleolus in that           of cells with long mitotic spindles retained focal          localization of Cdc and that both           net phosphosite mutants displayed          a modest defect in Cdc early anaphase release FEAR              Second           netm showed a synthetic          growth defect when combined with           dbf or the           msd allele of           CDC  Third phosphorylation site          mapping of Net purified from arrested           cdc cells WS and SC          unpublished data revealed that at least one S of          the five           in vivo phosphorylation sites in          the first  amino acids was directly phosphorylated by          Cdc           in vitro  Nevertheless because          expression of neither Netm nor Netm had a major          impact on exit from mitosis any direct effect of Cdc on          Net appears to be minor and the requirement for Cdc in          the release of Cdc might arise principally from          phosphorylation of other releasepromoting proteins          If Cdc plays a minor role in directly disassembling          RENT then how does it promote exit from mitosis Cdc          Dbf and Mob are not properly localized to the spindle          pole body in a significant fraction of           cdc cells       and          DbfMob protein kinase activity is diminished in           cdc cells                suggesting that at least one function of Cdc is to          generate maximally active DbfMob which can then          trigger Cdc release This explanation is unlikely to          account fully for Cdcs role in exit from mitosis          however because  overexpression of Cdc but not          DbfMob provoked ectopic release of Cdc from the          nucleolus and  the DbfMob kinase complex is at          least partially activated and is correctly localized to          the spindle pole body in  of           cdc cells at the nonpermissive          temperature               While this manuscript was under consideration two          papers presented new evidence on how Cdc contributes to          exit from mitosis      To summarize our study and          these recent findings we present a model Figure  that          is consistent with all of the available data Upon          initiation of chromosome segregation Cdc promotes the          transient Cdc early anaphase release     Our          data suggest that Cdc can promote FEAR by directly          phosphorylating Net as well as other          yettobeidentified FEAR factors Cdc also helps to          activate the MEN by directly phosphorylating and          disabling Bfa     which is thought to inhibit Tem          by serving as a GTPaseactivating protein Cdc          presumably impinges on the MEN by other means as well          because Cdc is required for maximal Dbf protein kinase          activity even in the absence of Bfas obligate partner          Bub     Once activated the MEN in turn sustains          the transient Cdc release enabled by Cdc and other          FEAR pathway components The unique ability of          overexpressed Cdc to expel Cdc from the nucleolus may          thus be a consequence of Cdcs abilities to directly          disassemble NetCdc complexes promote FEAR and          activate the MEN A complete understanding of Cdcs role          in mitotic exit will ultimately require identification of          all of its direct substrates in the MEN and FEAR          pathways                          A word of caution on phosphosite mapping          Cdc can phosphorylate up to  residues in the amino          terminal domain of Net           in vitro  Remarkably only five          sites in this same segment were confirmed to be          phosphorylated           in vivo in           cdc cells and only one of these          corresponded to a site phosphorylated by Cdc           in vitro  Whereas it is possible          that Cdc protein kinase activity is qualitatively or          quantitatively altered in cells held at the           cdc block resulting in reduced          phosphorylation of Cdc target sites on Net our data          suggest that Cdc is a promiscuous protein kinase This          raises significant concerns about the interpretation of          numerous studies in the literature that report effects of          CdcPolo on           in vitro processes without mapping          and genetic confirmation of phosphorylation sites          Moreover several recent studies have reported direct          mapping of sites phosphorylated by CdcPolo           in vitro       but in two          of these cases the authors relied exclusively on          phosphoshift analysis of mutant proteins to confirm that          the same sites are phosphorylated           in vivo  Given the significant          possibility that multiply mutated proteins are not          properly phosphorylated           in vivo for indirect reasons or          migrate aberrantly upon SDSPAGE it may be prudent to          perform direct mapping experiments to confirm          unambiguously the physiological significance of sites          phosphorylated by CdcPolo           in vitro                             Conclusions        Although Cdc activity  is necessary to free        nucleolar Cdc in late mitosis  can elicit ectopic        release of Cdc in preanaphase cells when overproduced         regulates the phosphorylation state of Net during        anaphase and  can disassemble native and recombinant        RENT complexes         in vitro by phosphorylating Net a        combination of         in vivo and         in vitro phosphosite mapping and        mutagenesis experiments suggest that Cdc mediates exit        from mitosis primarily by phosphorylating targets other        than Net The unusual promiscuity of CdcPolo highlights        the need to validate CdcPolo         in vitro phosphorylation sites by        direct         in vivo mapping experiments                    Materials and Methods                  Protein detection          The SDSboiling
