                    Background        EctoNucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases        ENTPDases formerly called ectoATPases hydrolyze        nucleotides in the presence of divalent cations and are        insensitive to inhibitors of Ptype Ftype and Vtype        ATPases     Three isoforms that differ in the ratio of        ATPaseADPase activity are present on the cell surface            ENTPDase with a ratio of  ENTPDase with a ratio        of  and ENTPDase with a ratio of  NTPDases are        important in many physiological processes like cell        motility adhesion nonsynaptic information transfer        secretion regulation of hemostasis and ectokinases            Understanding the enzymatic mechanisms of the NTPDases will        help description of their physiological functions and        development of strategies to regulate the functions of the        enzymes        The catalytic mechanism of NTPDases is not known even        though some basic facts of the catalysis have been        established NTPDases do not form phosphorylated        intermediates during catalysis a conclusion also supported        by lack of vanadate sensitivity and Pi product inhibition               The catalytic reaction appears to be        irreversible and no partial reactions have been observed             Divalent cations like Ca or Mg are required for        activity and maximal activity is reached when the        concentrations of substrates and divalent cations are equal            The specific activities of NTPDases vary over a        broad range from ten thousand units for potato apyrase to        less than one hundred units for chicken gizzard ectoATPase             Sequence comparisons indicate that most of        NTPDases contain five highly conserved regions apyrase        conserved region ACR  ACR      However the        catalytic sites have not been identified although ACR and        ACR have been implicated in  and phosphate binding        respectively            ENTPDase is also called CD as it was first        described as an antigen present on activated B and T        lymphocytes Residues of ACR to ACR of CD have been        mutated to study the involvement of the ACR regions in        catalysis E in ACR and S in ACR are required for        catalytic function     Substitution of H in ACR        converted CD into an ADPase in a quaternary structure        dependent manner     Mutation of WA in ACR        affected CD folding and translocation while mutation of        WA in ACR increased ATPase activity but diminished        ADPase activity     Mutations of D and G of ACR        and D and G of ACR demonstrated that the nucleotide        phosphate binding domains of NTPDases are similar to those        present in the actinheat shock proteinsugar kinase        superfamily     These results suggest that the        conserved residues of the ACR to  regions are involved in        the catalytic mechanism of CD        The catalytic activity of CD is dependent on the        presence of divalent cations Since the interactions of Ca        and Mg with proteins are difficult to study due to the        lack of spectroscopic properties vanadyl V IVO has        been used as a probe of the ligands that compose Mg  Ca         and Mn binding sites of several proteins including        carboxypeptidase     Sadenosylmethionine synthetase             pyruvate kinase      and F          ATPase      This cation        specifically binds to divalent cation binding sites of        several enzymes and in many cases serves as a functional        cofactor     Vanadyl has one axial and four equatorial        coordination sites relative to the axis of the        doublebounded oxygen an arrangement that is similar to        that for Ca and Mg  As it is known that the         A and         g tensors derived from the EPR spectrum        of bound VO are a direct measure of the nature of the        equatorial metal ligands     binding of VO to CD        could provide details about the catalytic mechanism of        CD        Recently we reported that a recombinant soluble CD        capable of hydrolyzing both ATP and ADP was expressed and        purified from insect cells     Only one        nucleotidebinding site was identified on the purified        soluble CD in the presence of Ca when nonhydrolysable        nucleotide analogs were used In this report we        characterized the signals that were obtained from bound VO        when ATP or ADP was present at the catalytic site of the        purified soluble CD The possible metal ligands for VO        at the catalytic site are proposed and the catalytic        mechanism is discussed                    Results                  Nucleotidase activity of purified soluble CD with          VO as cofactor          The ability of purified soluble CD to hydrolyze VO          ATP is shown in Figure  Soluble CD did not          hydrolyze either ATP or ADP in the absence of VO Fig          A When VO was mixed with ATP at a ratio of  the          concentrations of both ADP and AMP increased and ATP          decreased as the incubation time was prolonged Fig B          The ATPase activity of sCD with VO was about  of          that with Ca as a cofactor Vanadyl is unstable in          aqueous solution at pH in the absence of chelator and          will precipitate out of solution as VOOH                       n  The rate of precipitation depends          on the abundance and affinity of the chelator This means          that the actual VO concentration was lower than  mM          This result indicates that VO can functionally          substitute for Ca as cofactor for sCD nucleotidase          activity                          Characterization of bound VO ADPNP by          CWEPR          The parallel features of CWEPR spectrum of bound VO          in the presence of ADPNP an ATP analog are shown in          Figure a This spectrum shows V hyperfine splitting          and the center of the parallel transitions from molecules          with the VO bond oriented along the magnetic field A             g             which are strong enough to tell          the nature of VO equatorial ligands     Of the          eight transitions that result from the parallel oriented          molecules the                                                     and             transitions shown in the figures          from left to right respectively do not overlap with          perpendicular transitions The V hyperfine splitting          spectra from molecules with VO bond perpendicular to the          magnetic field A are much smaller and not shown here              The intensity of             peak is used as direct measurement          of the amount of bound VO  since this peak is the most          intense peak in the EPR spectrum that contains          contribution only from A            but not A      In this          study the intensities of each bound VO EPR feature          were normalized to  mg of protein          VO bound as the VO AMPPNP complex to sCD          produced a strong spectrum characterized by A            of  MHz and g            of  Fig b called species          T Table  The best fit of EPR species T to eq  is one          equatorial nitrogen from an amino group and three          equatorial oxygen ligands from carboxyl or phosphate          groups Table  This result is consistent with AMPPNP          binding strongly to a single site on sCD in the          presence of metal                              Characterization of EPR species from VO AMPCP          bound to sCD          Figure ashows the parallel features of the EPR          spectrum of sCD bound VO AMPCP Two sets of parallel          transitions were observed and the derived A            and g            values are listed in Table  One          set had A            of  MHz and g            of  which is defined as          species D Fig b The other set displayed A            of  MHz and g            of  which is called species          D Fig c The intensity of species D accounted for           of species T from bound VO AMPPNP and the          intensity of D accounted for  of species T The          intensity ratio of species D over D was           In order to distinguish species D from D the sample          with VO AMPCP bound to sCD was thawed and incubated          at room temperature for  minutes and the VO EPR          spectrum was collected again As shown in Figure aand          b either A            or g            values for both species D and D          were changed The intensity of species D was not changed          as it accounted for  of the intensity of species T          of the bound VO AMPPNP However the intensity of          species D was decreased dramatically and it accounted          for only  of the intensity of species T The          intensity ratio of D over D increased about  fold to          become           There are two sets of equatorial ligands that can fit          well the EPR species D according to Eq  Table  One          set includes two equatorial oxygen from two water          molecules one equatorial oxygen from a carboxyl group or          phosphate and one equatorial nitrogen from an amino          group The other set contains one equatorial oxygen from          water and three equatorial oxygens from carboxyl groups          or phosphate The best fit for the EPR species D to eq           is one equatorial oxygen from a hydroxyl group and three          equatorial oxygens from carboxyl groups or phosphate                          EPR characteristics of sCD bound VO ATP          In order to capture the bound VO EPR signal before          the enzyme completely turned over sCD and VO ATP          were mixed on ice immediately transferred into the EPR          tube and frozen The entire process took about           seconds The parallel portion of the collected VO EPR          spectrum is shown in Figure a VO ATP complex bound          to sCD produced an EPR spectrum with A            of  MHz and g            of  which corresponded to          species D Fig b The signal intensity from the bound          VO nucleotide complex accounted only for  of that          of species T from bound nonhydrolysable VO ADPNP          complex          The same sample made from mixing VO ATP and sCD          was incubated at room temperature for  minutes then          the VO EPR spectrum was generated as shown in Figures          cand d The EPR parameters derived from this VO EPR          spectrum were  MHz for A            and  for g            respectively which is consistent          with species D However the signal intensity decreased          about  fold compared to that obtained before room          temperature incubation                          Free VO binding to sCD characterized by          CDEPR          Like other metals Ca and Mg  free VO          inhibited the nucleotidase activities of sCD at high          concentration data not shown VO in the absence of          any nucleotides was added to sCD at  molar ratio          The parallel transitions of bound VO EPR spectrum are          shown in Figure  The features derived from the VO          EPR spectrum were  MHz for A            and  for g             which was designed as species V          Fig b The signal intensity of bound VO accounted          for  of that from the bound VO ADPNP complex          The best fit of equatorial ligands for species V          according to eq  is two equatorial oxygen from hydroxyl          groups and another two equatorial oxygen from two water          molecules                            Discussion        Vanadyl has been used to estimate the types of groups        that serve as metalligands in F          ATPase and other enzymes              because the g and A tensors of the V hyperfine        couplings are approximately a linear combination of tensors        from each type of group that contributes an equatorial        ligand      By studying the EPR spectra of bound VO        in the presence of different nucleotides we show that        the interaction of soluble CD with ATP is different from        that with ADP        It is not surprising that VO can functionally replace        Ca in the hydrolysis of both ATP and ADP by soluble CD        although the enzymatic activity is about  of that with        Ca as the cofactor since F          ATPase also hydrolyzes ATP at a        decreased rate when VO replaces Mg             The EPR features of VO are able to reveal some details        about how CD hydrolyzes ATP and ADP A single EPR        feature species T was observed when ADPNP a        nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP complexed with VO was        bound to sCD which is consistent with the presence of        only one nucleotide binding site     The g and A        tensors derived from species T are  and  MHz        respectively which can be fitted best with one amino group        and three groups combined from carboxyl and phosphate        groups as the equatorial ligands of the bound VO on        sCD In accordance with metalATP complex coordination on        other enzymes that hydrolyze ATP like F          ATPase      the  and        phosphate of ATP most likely bind to VO while the third        carboxyl group is contributed by a sidechain of aspartate        or glutamate of sCD It is not unusual for the amino        group of lysine to coordinate with metals in enzymes It        has been reported that the amino group serves as one of VO        equatorial ligands in CF          ATPase     pyruvate kinase             AdoMet synthetase      and carboxypeptidase            Thus one amino group from lysine one carboxyl group        from aspartate or glutamate and two oxygens from the        phosphates of ADPNP serve as the equatorial ligands of        sCD bound VO in the presence of ADPNP        In the presence of AMPCP bound VO produced two EPR        features species D and species D that are separated by        about  MHz As we have reported that sCD releases        intermediate ADP before ADP is further cleaved during ATP        hydrolysis     sCD probably has two conformations        that bind metalADP complexes one is the conformation that        releases the ADP intermediate and another that recruits        intermediate ADP back to the enzyme for further hydrolysis        to AMP However intact CD does not release intermediate        ADP during ATP hydrolysis suggesting that there is only        one ADP binding site on each CD monomer in the intact        protein      The two EPR species observed with VO        AMPCP probably correspond to the two different        conformations of bound ADP at the same catalytic site on        sCD The signal intensity of the bound VO AMPCP EPR        spectrum indicates that species D is dominant over species        D In order to further assign species D and D to the two        different conformations two experiments were done Fig         Incubation of sCD with VO AMPCP at room        temperature resulted in a dramatic decrease of the        intensity of species D while the signal intensity of        species D remained unchanged These data indicate that VO        AMPCP was released from the conformation corresponding        to species D however the conformation corresponding to        species D still had bound VO AMPCP More evidence for        two conformations of the enzyme was obtained from the EPR        spectra of bound VO ATP No species T was found        presumably because ATP was converted to ADP before the        sample was frozen Only species D was observed and its        intensity decreased as the incubation time was prolonged        We suggest that species D corresponds to the conformation        that releases ADP as an intermediate product and species D        corresponds to the conformation that binds ADP as a        substrate The lower signal intensities of species D and        D compared to that of species T suggest that the affinity        of sCD for ADP or its analog AMPCP is lower than that for        the ATP analog ADPNP which is consistent with the result        that only ATP analogs were detected on sCD            The calculated g          and A          values that best matched the        experimental values for species D suggest that one        hydroxyl group and three oxygens derived from carboxyl        groups and phosphates are the equatorial ligands of bound        VO ADP Since the conformation corresponding to species        D is found in the presence of ATP and is likely to be the        conformation that releases bound VO ADP it is likely        that the VO ligands are one phosphate and two carboxyl        groups     When ADP is the substrate and generates        species D one water molecule and a combination of three        groups between carboxyl groups and phosphates serve as the        equatorial ligands of bound VO on sCD The probable        combination of carboxyl groups and phosphates for species        D is one carboxyl group and two phosphates since VO        complexes ADP through two phosphates before VO ADP is        bound to the enzyme        The site directed mutagenesis studies on CD and other        members of the CD family give some hints about the        possible residues that serve as metal ligands at the        catalytic site of sCD The changes of D on ACR E        on ACR D D in HB and S on ACR dramatically        decrease both ATPase and ADPase activities of CD             Figure summarizes the possible coordination of Ca        from the data of species T species D and species D in        the different situations of sCD catalysis The catalytic        base attack results in cleavage of the phosphate of ATP        and one carboxyl group replaces the phosphate as a metal        ligand from species T to species D which is accompanied        by a swap of an amino group with a hydroxyl group S        This hydroxyl group S probably interacts with the        water molecule through hydrogen bond in the conformation        corresponding to species D to hydrolyze ADP The constant        carboxyl group that appears in all conformations of sCD        hydrolysis is likely contributed by D since it is close        to S        The results presented here also provide an explanation        to the free metal inhibition of CD catalytic activity        Free VO binds to sCD through two hydroxyl groups and        two water molecules that are hydrogen bonded to other        residues of sCD Once free VO occupies the catalytic        site the enzyme has to either release the metal or correct        the conformation before the substrates are recruited        properly                    Conclusions        VO can functionally substitute for Ca as a cofactor        for sCD Four different EPR spectra are obtained for VO        bound in the presence of different nucleotides and in the        absence of nucleotide The protein ligands for VO in the        presence of ATP are suggested to be carboxyl and amino        groups while those in the presence of ADP are probably        carboxyl and hydroxyl groups The mechanism of sCD        catalysis is discussed These results will provide guides        for further studies of the catalytic mechanism of        NTPDases                    Materials and Methods

al     Dissolved molecular          oxygen was removed from solutions by purging with dry          nitrogen gas Stock vanadyl and nucleotide solution were          thawed on ice and mixed at  molar ratio by vigorous          stirring Then VO nucleotide complexes were added to          purified sCD at  molar ratio mixed and incubated          for  minutes on ice before they were transferred into          EPR tubes Once the samples were in EPR tubes they were          immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in          liquid nitrogen before using                          EPR Measurement          CWEPR experiments were carried out at Xband  GHz          using a Bruker E spectrometer with a TE rectangular          standard cavity and a liquid nitrogen flow cryostat          operating at  K Simulations of these EPR spectra were          accomplished with the computer program QPOWA                        To estimate the types of groups that serve as          equatorial ligands to VO in each condition the          observed values of A            derived from simulation of the EPR          spectrum by QPOWA were compared with the coupling          constants obtained from model studies              using          A           calc   n           i A           i           where i represents the different types of equatorial          ligand donor groups n           i  is the number of ligands of          type i and A           i is the measured coupling constant          for equatorial donor group i     Similar equations          were used to calculated g            from a given set of equatorial          ligands for comparison with those derived          experimentally
