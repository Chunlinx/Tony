          well  i was just looking around my house and thinking about the painting that ive done   uhhuh   and the last time that um we tackled it i did the kitchen and i had gone through a period of depression at one time and painted everything a dark it was called a sassafras it was kind of an orangish brown   okay   it was not real pretty anyway so the kitchen was one of the rooms that got hit with that color   yeah uhhuh i see   i tried to cover it with white and it was quite a a feat getting that dark color covered and then just the hassles getting around the cabinets and know if i look underneath my cabinets im not satisfied with the jobs i i did on it because therere splotches   yeah   but im glad its done because its brighter   yeah yeah thats for sure       well we uh i just got married about six months ago and we bought a house at the same time so were im sitting here in my forty year old house and were about halfway through the painting process     oh lord   so uh the only uh i guess the the big discussion just kind of what you were mentioning has been the color we ended up with our our living and dining room are now uh kind of a a light peach color with uh and its got all the old original hardwood trim and stuff so weve got the trim in kind of uh kind of an offwhite and this is really the first uh interior painting project that ive attacked  and its its been uh its been something else  to say the least we we had the same type of situation uh the walls were uh uh well they werent the color difference wasnt so bad but uh there was semigloss underneath   uhhuh   and we put a flat over the top and everywhere youd miss thered be this little bright spot you could see  it seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint   oh yeah   every time the sun would come up in the morning id see another spot and have to drag out the paint can but uh weve learned were we uh we worked weve worked our way back into the hallway and and were in the middle of the bathroom now but uh its its been quite an adventure the other the other thing that makes it uh a little more difficult weve got all hardwood floors and uh we weve learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors since the since the first time we spent a lot of time on the floor with a tooth toothbrush and what not cleaning up   so what are you going to get it off with if you get it on and its dried   well its its not too bad it it uh the floors are finished with a polyurethane and its really not to bad to get off it it were just using latex and its not too bad to get it off once its dried even it it it uh comes off with like a   uhhuh   a mild abrasive pad like a Scotchbrite pad or something like that and water and soap and water so we got pretty lucky on that   and its not scratching your floor because its so thick oh thats pretty good we painted every room in this house some of them like two three times we have two children   no not really but okay yeah   and they just they ruin       its just terrible what they do and then i have been coloring my hair and im real haphazard when i do it so ive got dye on my bathroom door   yeah oh gosh   and i havent figured out how to get that off i guess ill have to take that door down and really get it good   yeah yeah probably so   and then we have a two story we did the outside of it one summer that was horrendous i mean i i couldnt stand the back side going up that high on the ladder i could get up on the roof and do that   okay yeah yeah   but i dread that the next time   yeah i we uh our house was painted as part of the purchase contract so we didnt have to mess with that this time but ive i i grew up on a farm so i ive ive messed with outdoor painting a little bit uh but most of that it was done with a sprayer and uh up in the bucket of a loader tractor or something like that so it took a lot of the hassle out and then theyre were not you know youre not nearly as concerned with a barn or a granary or something like that as you would be with your own house   uhhuh no i wouldnt think so have you guys tackled your ceilings yet     uh a little bit yeah yeah   oh we got to do that this summer were dreading it   yeah     its like theyre dark everything else is white   yeah oh gosh yeah just just the opposite of what everybodys uh working towards now   now have you thought about this that wherever you buy your paint you need to make sure that that stores not likely to go out of business   yeah yeah absolutely  yeah we uh we stocked up the first time around but weve definitely got all the formulas on file and uh were theyll be there for a while were were pretty comfortable with that but yeah it it im im real nervous every time i i open a new can im wondering if i shouldnt buy about twenty gallons at one time and keep it all in a in a wash tub or something somewhere because im always im always afraid that the next coat is not going to match   uhhuh   but uh its gone pretty well it just it it takes it takes some time my problem is while im not overly proud of it but im a selfproclaimed proclaimed perfectionist and it it takes me a long time to do trim and things like that and ill find ill find something as im going along something not related like like uh ive gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because they they really didnt match they were a few of them were broken and things like that so i always pick up these little extra tasks as im doing this and and the painting actually takes probably uh a fourth of the time and i im always doing all this other stuff and my wifes hollering at me and wondering what else ive come home with from work this time to to put in a ceiling fan or something strange like that so uh it it it always it it it gets you to look at everything real hard when you you start putting a coat of paint on everything you start to notice where all the dents and scratches and things are everywhere   oh but i still feel good the minute i put that paint on even if it has got a dent in it i do   yeah yeah it sure makes a difference   oh what what else can i tell you about painting oh and i get it all in my hair too do you do that     yeah   spots in it   yeah its its been uh we we bought this house with the idea that we were going to spend you know spend a lot of time working on it and uh it was part you know part of the excitement was was getting a good deal on an older house it just it really hadnt been taken care of very well it it was actually it was rented out for a couple of years and things like that so we uh we ended up getting a fairly good deal on it but uh there just isnt enough time i ive i find myself going to work knowing that that theres a job about half done at home and i really if i would if id just stay home and finish it id feel a lot better but uh im im starting to learn that theres always something else so that you could  once you get done you can always start over and and you make up all kinds of excuses so uh   are you having to repair the walls at all   uh not a whole lot it theyre theyre in pretty good condition um as as far as uh major repairs you know lot a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that but uh the only the most major things have been uh oh i guess i i moved a couple of outlets and or uh switches i should say they for some reason they put a bathroom light switch in the hallway and uh yeah and i i didnt like that very well so i i moved that but uh   um thats smart   most of it most of its in pretty good shape   so where do you live   uh live in Dallas   cause im in Garland   okay okay   could you try to call this weekend   uh   to that switchboard did you keep getting that it was down   no no i havent uh i hadnt tried in fact we were we were planting flowers this weekend so uh i was pretty tied up   you didnt yeah   but   well ive never tried any other kinds of painting besides on a surface like the house like to paint a picture or anything i dont know i cant think of anything else to say about painting   uhhuh no that uh thats   it hurts your back and it hurts your arm   yeah you know it i get a sore i get a sore neck from looking up all the time yeah things like that but uh no that pretty much covers my experiences     yeah but youre glad youre doing it right   oh yeah most definitely it it just it makes such a difference like i like i say the the overall appearance of this house is what really devalued it so much uh i you know i dont want to put a price on it but i just feel like were every every gallon of paint adds a tremendous amount of value to the house you know every every time i do something a aside from that it just makes me feel a whole lot better to come home and you know old the walls are clean and they match and all those kinds of things   uhhuh do you have one of those straight edge things to put underneath when youre doing the baseboards   yeah yeah we do it uh it sometimes works and it sometimes doesnt its i uh when i start doing trim i ive gotten to where i i tend to freehand it because there theres so many layers of paint on this house after forty years that uh it its so hard to tell where an edge is anymore and uh   on your baseboards   yeah yeah they   you dont have any carpet down in your house   no theres no carpet in the house right now   see weve got carpet and i havent figured out how youre supposed to paint it on down so that you wont see where you stopped off and still not get it on the carpet because every time you move that edger then it gets the carpet into it   um okay well you know um   you cant hold it there until its dried   yeah i ive  ive seen uh theyre they make some plastic edging stuff that comes in like three foot lengths and you can uh you can tape them together and and and put
