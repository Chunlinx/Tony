                                 The Prince of Dimness            What an apocalypse werehaving First a young hairdresser in Stigmata collapses on a crowdeddance floor as an invisible crown of thorns is pounded into her head Then alurching demon made of excrement materializes out of an overflowing toilet bowlin Dogma  And now just in time to prove that the end of the millenniumwill indeed bring about the destruction of all movie logic we have End ofDays  in which Satan pauses by a stoop unzips his pants and lets flow ameandering stream of flammable urine As Casper Van Dien puts it rathersuccinctly in The Omega Code  Religion would have us believe there aredemons fighting and battling over our souls But who needs that            And anyway thesemillennial demons are a particularly clumsy lot far less canny and elegantthan say Rosemarys Baby s John Cassavetes whose earthly weapon ofchoice was spiked chocolate mousse In The Omega Code  for instanceMichael Yorks Antichrist has seeming command of all the law enforcementpersonnel in the world but none of them can locate Casper Van Dienplaying aNew Age guru who has run off with a CD that will unlock the genetic code ofthe universeas he flees conspicuously on foot through the empty Los Angelesstreets in the dead of night The Forces of Darkness are so powerless thattheyre reduced to hanging around their headquarters in Rome listening to thebefuddled Los Angeles cops on a police scanner            In keeping with our apostate times all these moviesfeature as their protagonist a faithchallenged Chosen One In The OmegaCode  Van Diens character the worldfamous globetrotting Dr GillenLane cringes when somebody sings Jesus Loves Me My mother used to sing methat song he explains but you know what She died in a tragic car accidentwhen I was  years old In Stigmata Patricia Arquette plays afrenetic party girl who of all the people in the world is judged to be thebest candidate for mouthing lost Aramaic scriptures as unseen nails arehammered into her appendages You dont get it do you she yells at apriest during a lull in these proceedings I have fucking holes through mywrists Linda Fiorentino in Dogma  has lost her faith over herinability to conceive while Arnold Schwarzenegger in End of Days  isso distressed over the murders of his wife and daughter that he is reduced tomaking smoothies out of PeptoBismol and leftover pizza            OK God works inmysterious ways but it is the opinion of this column that screenwriters shouldnot There is a big difference between divine obfuscation and sloppy thinkingIn Stigmata  for instance an unquiet dead priest is desperate to notifythe world of a suppressed fifth gospel which when revealed will expose thegreed and false pretenses of the Roman Catholic church This restless spirithas the power to cause steam vents to erupt and windows to explode in showersof glass He can give Patricia Arquette the stigmata and make her eyes turn redand have her speak in a mans voice in ancient languages and send her spiralingaloft in her apartment until she ends up crucified in midair What he cant dothough is just come out and say whats on his mind            His poor communication skills are mirrored by thegeographically impaired Satan of End of Days  It is the murky premise ofthis movie that evil is not quite as renewable a resource as is commonlybelieved In order for the Dark Angel to continue his important work in humanaffairs he must appear on Earth every thousand years to impregnate a youngwoman In End of Days the devil is first seen as a transparent waterywrinkle that rises out of a manhole and sashays into the mens room of arestaurant whereupon it makes a forcible entry into the body of a prominentinvestment banker played by Gabriel Byrne            Wearing his new body Satan sets forth in search ofthe young woman with whom he must breed by the stroke of midnight on Dec  The womans name is Christine York and she was chosen for this gruesometask on the day of her birth  years earlier when she was seized from hermothers arms in the hospital by a satanic nurse and given a quickie baptismwith rattlesnake blood Christine is also being hunted by an ecclesiastical hitsquad named the Vatican Knights which wants to drive a stake through her heartbefore she can mate with Satan and by Schwarzeneggers Jericho Cane who justwants to save her In search of his beloved Satan takes time to visit a priestin his hospital room The priest is named Thomas Aquinasnot disappointinglythe reincarnated author of Summa Theologica but some old geezer who hascut out his own tongue and put it in a mayonnaise jar for reasons that it wouldtake a second viewing of End of Days for me to figure out Not in thismillennium            Working nimbly Satancarves up this guys torso with arcane writing and using scalpels and scissorsand other handy hospital accessories crucifies him on the ceiling How strongis that acoustic tile anyway One of the phrases on poor Aquinas body isChrist in New York which Jericho coming upon the corpse shortly thereafterquickly deciphers to mean Christine York the name of the mothertobe Twoproblems  nobody s that good at hermeneutics and  why would thearchfiend whos in a big hurry to consummate his relationship with Christinebefore the ball drops in Times Square interrupt his mission to leave clues forhis enemies            Satan is good at many things in this movie He can peegasoline walk through fire induce visions and even resurrect the dead butwhen it comes to the simple task of locating Christinewhich everyone elseseems to be able to do with relative easehes so helpless he has to breakinto Jerichos apartment and badger him for her whereabouts            Its no wonder that Good triumphs over Evil becauseSatan makes a lot of bad choices in this movie Dogma at least has somefun with the idea that God is really Alanis Morissette and Michael York inThe Omega Code is as cheerful an antichrist as one could wish for butin End of Days when Satan is finally revealed in his true form eruptingout of the floor of a cathedral to confront Schwarzenegger guess what he is Agiant frustratedlooking bat that roars and slobbers and flails its wingsaround like a baby bird thats not ready to leave the nest With a hopeless bodlike that its no surprise that the devil would rather look like GabrielByrne And if movies get any stupider the next millennium the End of Dayscant come soon enough for me
