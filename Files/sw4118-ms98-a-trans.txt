                um i dont know um does your do you have recycling in Atlanta   uh yeah i see  seen some uh theres some trucks that come around kind of like garbage trucks they have like four different big containers on them and theyll go and uh and collect collect it but i think the i think its pretty expensive to do   uhhuh do you have to do you have to do the sorting or do they do the sorting for you   well from i can tell what ive seen of it they have different color containers and uh you sort of sort it out uh in your home and then put it out on the curb and they and they just throw the matching color uh   umhum into the different box   container yeah yeah   yeah  up here like New Hampshire doesnt uh well where i am uh we dont have any recycling we dont even have a bottle bill or anything like that and thats   uhhuh   thats not real thats not real popular with the states around us because   yeah   the the extra nickel or what is it extra thirty cents for a for a for six bottles everybody everybody comes across the border  to buy the cheaper the the cheaper drinks   yeah yeah   but i i i i think that well i do some recycling like i save my my bottles and things like that but i dont think i do as as much i think i could do more   yeah   and i theres a big problem here with like landfills   yeah   uh like they the the landfills are just are just like filling up with stuff   uhhuh   and i think that if if they were to recycle if i were to i guess if if there was like some kind of a program i would do it because just so that we could save the space in those things   yeah well uh its kind of funny i saw um a special on a public public broadcasting station down here and uh they were talking about recycling and they they uh i i forgot exactly where this was but they were showing just piles and piles of plastic and glass that uh was at a recycling center but it was costing them uh about forty dollars a ton to recycle and they could only get about ten dollars a ton for it   yeah   so  so you know there was just uh no nothing in it for them   i i was   and uh   i i dont know when i was in when i i was  last year i went to a class and and uh we would we they they brought it this guy that uh that made lets see he made he made a lot of money working because because like in in the states like Massachusetts and Vermont and all the states around New Hampshire they put in this bottle bill do you have a bottle bill down there   im not sure i   thats where its like every every every every can is stamped with like a a nickel return on it   oh   and its like you you have to like if you can turn the can in to to any store and they have to pay you a nickel for it   umhum   but what happens is that then all these cans come running you know some stores get more cans than they sell and they have a big problem with that but   yeah yeah   the law says that if they sell they have to collect   yeah   but anyway this guy like all the like the beer distributors were having like the biggest problem and uh   umhum   he he he actually like made a business that just went around from like distributor to distributor   uh   collecting like all the cans and he said like some things like the aluminum cans   uhhuh   they they could make money on because aluminum can be they can just throw that back into the pot   right   and that just gets melted back up and thats not a problem but um like the plastic ones you said like you were saying they they lost like big money on because they cant recycle they cant reuse the some plastics can be reused but most plastics cant be remelded remolded or melted melted into into other things   uhhuh   and it just becomes more of a pain than its worth   yeah   but i dont know i i wonder you know should should they be making things that like just cant be reused   yeah   uh it kind of i i dont i dont and well should i be buying things that cant be reused   yeah yeah its uh uh something i think about a lot too is you know when youre buying everything is you know if its not convenient people dont want it and usually convenience means waste   i yeah well you know  i i cant something i cant figure out is it do you every do you every did you ever see those big old Coke bottles you know the glass ones that were like they were kind of green   yeah yeah   at at what point in time did it get to be at what you know i didnt i thought they were great but at what point in time did it get to be worse   yeah
