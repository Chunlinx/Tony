 INTRODUCTIONIn recent years considerable attention has focused onincreasing competition in the provision of postal services Thereasoning is that competitive pressure brings about productiveefficiency efficient price structures product innovation and theelimination of economic rents Postal administrations however areoften under constraints that limit their ability to respond to suchpressureConsider the United States Postal Service It is constrained bylaws and regulations formulated by Congress over more than twocenturies This political process focused as much on socialconsiderations as on the kinds of market forces that shapecompetitive outcomes And once made provisions have tended toremain These observations apply though in somewhat altered formeven since the Presented at the Conference on Postal and Delivery EconomicsThe Center for Research in Regulated Industries at RutgersUniversity Vancouver Canada June    The writer isSpecial Assistant to the Postal Rate Commission an independentregulatory agency of the United States Government The viewsexpressed herein are his own and do not necessarily represent thoseof the Commission or any of its members Correspondence may be sentto rmitinamecomPostal Reorganization Act of  Specifically that Act turnedrate making over to an independent Postal Rate Commission but italso specified a range of factors to which the Commission must giveweight and it required that certain classification structures ofthe past be honoredThis paper focuses on changes the United States Postal Servicewould make if it had the freedom to position itself to withstandcompetition in all of its markets Crew  After suchadjustment it might become a sustainable monopoly If thisoccurred the Services configuration would be that of a successfulcompetitor and at the same time any benefits from having oneprovider would be retained These benefits include economies ofscale and joint production No changes of any kind are advocatedNote that the extent of any changes that would be made is a measureof the extent of nonmarket choices that have been allowed by theprotection currently providedCreating a competitive environment would involve at a minimumeliminating the Private Express Statutes and the mailbox ruleAbsent these some portions of the mail stream would attract As discussed below it required continuation of  preferredsubclasses  These statutes are laws that comprise the letter mailmonopoly  The mailbox rule specifies that no one other than thePostal Service and the addressee may put mail into the box Thisrule is part of the United States Criminal Code No other countryhas such a rule Note that eliminating the rule is not a simplechange and has a downside In particular  The Postal Serviceitself owns and maintains many of the boxesspecifically thoseknown as cluster boxes  Many owners of boxes particularlythose in apartment complexes and those secured by locks do notwant to open them to all parties  The ability of the PostalInspection Service or similar replacement agency to control mailfraud would bethe attention of competitors The Postal Service would sufferfinancial losses This could lead to a spiral of rate increases andfurther volume lossesThe Postal Service would be better off if it lowered selectedrates and took back some of the lost volume If it did this someof its new competitors would be driven out of business causingboth investor losses and charges that the government should not becompeting with private enterprise Such a scenario is notdesirable A much better approach would be to allow the PostalService to make adjustments firstAccordingly the setting of this paper is that all protectionwill be removed and that the Postal Service is given wide latitudeto make its products and services as uncontestable as possible Andif it were found to be a sustainable monopoly one could askwhether that situation would be better than the one that existsnow There are at least two reasons why it might Firstcompetitive configurations give superior costbased signals tobuyers so that the value of the service received is greaterSecond the Postal Service would have to face real competitivethreats at all times In fact some business at the margins wouldprobably be lost Therefore the entire organization would sense ona regular basis that competitors stand ready to take its customersand it would see some customers leaving Such pressure might notsatisfy those who envision a market with a number of activereduced if general access to the boxes were allowed And manymembers of the general population favor the rule because it reducesthe number of people who havecompetitors but having a number of active competitors is notalways a viable optionThe next section discusses general guidelines for the paper Thethird section identifies changes that the Postal Service would makeimmediately Section four looks at how the range of postal productsmight change It points to general directions and is not preciseThe fifth section discusses worksharing and contracting while thesixth deals with the general issue of cost recognition in ratedesign It focuses to a considerable extent on weaknesses in thecurrent state of knowledge The seventh and eighth sections discusscosts by destination and by customer Then the next two discussinverse price caps and the benefits of having one governmentprovider A conclusion follows GENERAL GUIDE LINES First it is necessary to discuss theframework within which the Postal Services adjustment process willbe consideredAs noted above relaxing the Private Express Statutes is theessential first step Hiding under the Statutes however is a rulemandating that all bills statements of account and personal orhandwritten correspondence if mailed must be mailed First Classthe MBMFC rule To a much greater degree than is commonlyrecognized this rule is critically important to the functioning ofthe Postal Service as it now exists The MBMFC rule requires asubstantial portion of the mail volume to be sent at highFirstClass rates instead of at the lower StandardA rates eventhough the senders may not value the high service levels or thespecial features of First Class If the rule were eliminated thePostal Service would lose a large portion of its revenueimmediately with little or no reduction in cost and rateadjustments would have to be madeAs an economic matter it is possible that much of the MBMFCmail is highdemand mail and thus that the rule segments themarket according to demand In order to continue benefiting fromthis split the Postal Service might try to maintain it evenwithout the Statutes But since rates based on content are seldomthe outcome of competitive forces such an effort would in alllikelihood fail What is important to understand is that the MBMFCrule is fundamental to First Class and Standard A as we know themand eliminating it would unleash forces that would lead to a majorrestructuring not to a minor adjustmentIn addition it seems likely that the Postal Service would beprohibited from selling below incremental cost would be requiredto preserve some form of universal service and would be permittedto adjust its service levels Also the Postal Service would beallowed to grant volume discounts and to negotiate contractratesAnother question concerns the most effective way to install aprofit motive In general the outcome of effective competitionisovercome by licensing access to the mail box  In addition toits high service levels First Class offers free forwarding and issealed legally protected against inspection Standard A isdeferrable without these features and has a lower rateexpected to be a normal profit level with the understandingthat unusually efficient firms might achieve supranormal profitsfor a time One possibility would be to allow a portion of anyprofit to be used for performance bonuses to management but therewould be reason for concern if high and persistent profitsresulted Also there would be concern if monopoly power allowedcertain products to have excessive prices In order to attenuatethese concerns it might be reasonable to place price caps on anyde facto monopoly mail categories particularly any used by smallmailers with no alternativesWithin this set of rules particularly if profits are allowedthe Postal Service would behave much like a profitmaximizing firmConsiderable attention would be paid to demand and to prices thatcould be charged successfully In addition one would expect arenewed interest in costs for narrow product categories even forspecific customersIf the Private Express Statutes were repealed it is possiblethat Congress would also change the framework for labornegotiations especially the nostrike rule and the requirement forbinding arbitration when no agreement is reached throughcollective The restriction would be that it must provide some reasonablelevel of service on seemingly reasonable terms to all recipients A regulator might well be required to administer any price capsincrementalcost floors or other restrictions  Note that theeffects of Postal Service adjustments could be substantial andwidespread not only on mailers who have invested heavily aroundthe present structure of products and rates but also on suchcompetitors as newspapers Some of these groups would stronglyresist any changesbargaining It might also lift the pay caps on managementsalaries Even without such changes the Postal Service couldpursue regional wage differentials For purposes of this paperhowever it is not necessary to specify a new labor environmentWhat is important is that labor negotiations take place within theframework of a situation where the loss of business to competitorsis an everyday reality If the Postal Service makes all feasiblechanges and the markets are found not to be contestable it will bebecause the economies of scale and joint production and theadvantages of being an incumbent are larger than anydisadvantages associated with the levels of productivity orwages IMMEDIATE CHANGESWith the freedoms and goals described above there are a numberof changes that the Postal Service would make immediately Firstit would eliminate the preferred categories of mail all of whichhave rates that are below corresponding commercial rates Thismeans there would be no separate incounty rates no separate ratesfor classroom material no separate rates for nonprofitorganizations which exist both in Periodicals and in Standard Ano separate rates for Library mail and no separate rates forScienceof Other advantages the Postal Service could retain relate tosuch things as the payment of taxes the need for a return oninvestment the right of eminent domain and immunity from parkingtickets Congress would have to decide on such issues  Free forthe blind mail would continue to be available only if theGovernment continued to provide a subsidy to support it Also theGovernment might continue special arrangements relating to voterregistration As long as there is an appropriation these programsdo not put the Postal Service at a competitive disadvantageagriculture mail Under the rate levels of the most recentlycompleted rate case eliminating the preferred categories wouldyield about onethird of a billion dollars in additionalrevenueSecond several special rate arrangements would be discontinuedSpecifically reduced rates for books would be eliminated and evenif there were a separate subclass for them it would not have ratesthat are invariant with distance Also Periodicals would notreceive reduced rates and any rates that resulted would not dependon the proportion of advertising content These changes wouldincrease revenue by another ninetenths of a billion dollars Theseamounts are not large but competition generally preventscharging higher rates to some customers in order to fund reducedrates for othersThe above changes would allow substantial reductions in thecomplexity of rates and in the complexity of the data systemswhich in turn would allow improvements in the costs and volumes forthe subclasses that remainedA third change that would be made immediately concerns theprovisions for parcel mail in Alaska Presently as a matter ofpolicy senders of parcels to residents in the Alaska Bush whichis not accessible by surface transportation pay surface rates formail that is transported by air in low volumes This would not bedone in a The law currently specifies that the rates for books will notvary with distance This makes the book subclass very inefficientat serving those for whom it was established  Under the existingrate arrangement the Postal Service can consider externalities insetting rates This would not occur in a competitive systemcompetitive system To places where surface transportation isnot available senders would be required to pay air rates andpossibly air rates keyed to the characteristics of the Alaskan airsystem According to rate case figures this would provideadditional revenues of about  million but one would expectassociated adjustments that went beyond this figureFourth there would be post office closings It is not easy topredict which post offices would be closed Using conservativeguidelines an analysis done in the late s concluded that about offices should be closed Services for people using theseoffices would be provided in a less expensive way using contractstations in some cases Since a number of offices have been closedin the last  years this estimate of  may not be currentBut if  per year were saved for  offices anotheronethird of a billion dollars would become availableFifth there might be changes in the role the Postal Serviceplays in policing the fraudulent use of the mails In a competitiveenvironment it might not be left with police powers and the rightto select those activities in the crime area that would give it acompetitive advantage One alternative would be to turn thisfunction over to the Department of JusticeFinally there are some operational changes that would probablybe made  The Postal Service would undoubtedly begin These amounts were calculated conservatively and would varyby rate casehandling unaddressed mail on city routes even as it doesalready on rural routes  The Postal Service might stop orsubstantially alter its detached address label program foradvertising mail For mailers the use of detached labels would bea poor alternative to using unaddressed mail for the PostalService the use of detached labels is not well aligned withcurrent and future automation plans and it may aggravate thealignment of rates and costs  The Postal Service would probablymake changes in the way postage is sold Currently it adheres to apolicy that postage will be sold at face value regardless of thecosts associated with its sale A first step might be discounts forthe use of meter and permit indicia which cost much less thanstamps but other changes would follow Haldi  BASIC PRODUCTS OFFEREDExcept for the creation of worksharing discounts and ExpressMail the basic product line of the Postal Service was inheritedfrom Congress at the time of Postal reorganization in  It isnot At the end of FY  there were  post offices Eachpost office has a postmaster This count does not include stationsbranches or contract stations Annual Report of the PostmasterGeneral   Unaddressed mail would go to all stops on acarriers route Presently addresses are required on such piecesThis is essentially a makework scheme the mailers do the extrawork of putting the address on each piece and the Postal Servicedoes the extra work of arranging these pieces in delivery orderNote that the postal services in many other countries carryunaddressed mail  An alternative to unaddressed mail would be toauction off the right to be a third bundle on specific days inspecific post offices A related change would be to set box rentsat what the traffic will bear  The Express Mail subclass andECOM were created since  Congress changed the qualificationsfor Incounty rates in  The following subclasses have beeneliminated ECOM transient controlled circulation specialdelivery and singlepiece third Limited circulation waseliminated but it was not a subclassknown what products would evolve under competition To stimulatediscussion five perspectives are offered below Speed of ServiceTwo important characteristics of mail are  it does not costmore to process some batches of mail before others and  thevolume of mail fluctuates To accommodate these fluctuations anduse resources evenly it would seem reasonable to offer two tiersof service rapid and deferred with air transportation being usedfor the rapid product Other distinctions are possible such asbulk and nonbulk but the speed distinction would seem todominateThe Postal Service has two basic subclasses for letters andflats First Class originally rapid nonbulk and sealed againstinspection and Standard A originally deferrable bulk and notsealed against inspection Over time these distinctions havedeteriorated First due in part to worksharing programs there arenow bulk categories in First Class Second a substantial portionof Standard A is entered into the Postal Service near itsdestination in which case the opportunity to defer is limitedThird mailers and recipients are demanding ontime delivery ofStandard A and the Postal Service is accommodating theseinterests One could argue that many mailers are gettingFirstClass service at StandardA rates Fourth many mailers ofFirst Class are not concerned about inspection Fifth the ratestructures of First Class and Standard A are dissimilar in ratherextreme ways detracting attention from any focus on serviceNonetheless the rationality of service tiers remains If theMBMFC rule was removed and all mailers could choose between First Class and Standard A and if the fundamental distinctionbetween the two was service one would expect a moderate ratedifference based on a real service difference Also one wouldexpect increased similarity in their rate structures But theassumption that change would center around these two subclass maynot be a good one More pervasive changes would seem likely but itis not clear what they would be Tolerance for the IrregularThroughout its history the Postal Service has backed away fromconstraints on the dimensions and characteristics of pieces thatcan be mailed The view has been that its mission is to serve andthat whatever is mailed will be delivered In many cases and oftenfor the same rate a piece can be handwritten or typed awkward orstandard in shape flimsy or stiff This posture has resulted inthe engineers being told to design equipment and mail handlingsystems that will handle a frightening range of mailcharacteristics This has presented design difficulties and hasresulted in costly equipment It has also led to operatingdifficulties and to high processing costsEvidence of tolerance follows  It was not until  that anonstandard surcharge was put on FirstClass Mail and even now itapplies only to the first ounce  Except for some recentautomation categories there is no rate distinction in First Classamong letters flats and parcels Therefore a letter weighingmore than one ounce In FY  the Postal Service processed  billionhandwritten addresses Annual Report of the Postmaster General The report says Our clerks or our new technology read yourhandwriting no matter how creative it might be p pays the same rate as a flat or a parcel of the same weight There is no rate distinction in Priority between flats and parcelseven though there could be differences in the equipment used toprocess them  Except for the barcode discount Periodicals ratesare not based on shape or machinability Some magazines forexample are too heavy to be processed on flat sorting machines andnewspapers would be expected to have costs different from those ofmagazines  Handwritten addresses and pieces without Zip Codesare accepted without surcharge  During highspeed mechanizedprocessing some flats with open edges become aerodynamic Yetdespite a large cost difference there is no rate distinctionbetween these flats and those that can be processed effectively Nonautomated FirstClass and StandardA mailers have the option ofrequesting that their mail be processed manually even though thecosts for such processing are substantially higher than mechanizedprocessing It is doubtful that any of these tolerances wouldexist in a competitive systemConceptually one can visualize a streamlined lowcostprocessing system for welldefined lettersize pieces that aremachinereadable Similar systems could exist for flats and forparcels Such systems might allow lower rates for qualifying mailwhile pieces that would not qualify might be rejected or requiredto pay a surcharge based on costs Prices that recognize costs sendsignals to mailers concerning the work that needs to be done Theyprevent highcost mailers from being cross subsidized by lowcostmailers and they See response to interrogatory OCAUSPS in Docket NoR allow the efficiencies of a lowcost mailstream to be availableto all who can use themOne can surmise that a competitive postal service would do abetter job of presenting technologically feasible lowcost productoptions to mailers and either rejecting nonconforming pieces orlevying surcharges Certainly a competitor would go after suchlowcost pieces first as has Roadway Package Service in the parcelarea DemandOne of the hallmarks of competitive pricing is that higherprices are charged to higherdemand customers This practicebecomes even more pronounced outside of a breakeven requirementwhen additions to net revenue can be keptUnder current conventions the Postal Service sets prices forwhole subclasses and cannot select specific customers forsurcharges or discounts And for these subclasses there are nocases where a lower price will lead to an increase in net revenueHowever if there are categories of mail that are attractive tocompetitors these categories should be viewed as extremely elasticand the Postal Service would be expected to move its rates toward alower markup over costs In other words competition would force aresponse from the Postal Service Similarly higher rates wouldbe expected for less elastic categories An extreme but possibly realistic situation should not beoverlooked Suppose a potential competitor needed a critical massin order to begin operations If one mailer were large enough toprovide that mass or nearly provide it that mailer bythreatening to leave the Postal Service might be able to negotiateextremely low ratesDealing with this kind of situation is different from anythingbeing done today Basically the Postal Service would be expectedto assess competition and mailers willingness to pay and then tosegment its markets as much as possible Indeed one would expect adegree of creativity from the Postal Service in finding ways toacknowledge demand ContentThe subclasses of mail that exist today are based inconsiderable degree on content In short there is a subclass forlibrary materials one for books one for bound printed matter andseveral for periodicals Further the periodicals subclasses havestrict rules on enclosures have regulations that depend on whetherthe publication is bound or unbound and most have rates thatdepend on whether the material inside is advertising oreditorial Also there are cases where merchandise is treateddifferent from nonmerchandise and where under the MBMFC rulediscussed above some kinds of content may use one subclass and notothersIn cases where the willingness to pay of the sender is relatedto content it might be possible to argue that content wouldcontinue to be recognized in rates However it is quite uncommonfor competitive carriers to differentiate based on contentInstead one would expect the emphasis on content to eitherdecrease significantly or disappear If content did continue as aratesetting factor it would probably take a different form fromwhat now exists In postal parlance editorial is defined as material that isnot advertising  Service MeasurementUnder the assumption that the level of service is importantknowledge about the level achieved is important This has been adifficult issue for the Postal Service In recent years an externalmeasurement system for FirstClass Mail has been developed and onenow exists for Priority but actual service levels for most othersubclasses have been a great unknown To fill this void manymailers measure the service their own mail receives The PostalService usually responds to these measurements by saying that theyare not statistically valid or that they are not representativeNevertheless it is well known that actual service levels are oftenquite far from the published standardsIn a Postal Service poised to meet competition considerablymore effort would be directed toward meeting published standardsand toward measuring the service achieved Mailers would demandsuch performance and such knowledge Competitors would jump at thechance to meet unmet mailer needs A step beyond this issue is thequestion of tracking and tracing The Postal Service is behind itscompetitors at this point under competition catchup would beexpected to occur at a faster pace WORKSHARING AND CONTRACTINGOne way to compete is to bring the strengths of the privatesector inhouse This can be done through worksharing discounts orcontracts and is especially effective when mailers can do the workin a different way than the Postal Service Mitchell  Theamount of work that can be turned over in this way is quitelargeConsider the following example Suppose mailers can sortaddresses on a computer and then print them in ZIP Code orderSuppose further that they can do this for  cents per piece andthat this saves the Postal Service  cents per piece In the areaswhere worksharing discounts are offered now the tendency has beento move toward a discount of  cents This lowers the net mailingcost for the mailers involved and makes them less likely to go tocompetitors However if the mailers were not on the verge ofstopping the worksharing activity or of going to competitors thePostal Service would maximize its financial position by giving adiscount closer to the figure of  cents So with freedom tocompete there could be important changes in the way worksharingdiscounts are set Of course prior to such changes informationand analysis would be neededThe Postal Service has extensive worksharing discounts Thereare however some limitations First no discounts are based onany cost savings associated with the avoidance of collectionactivities Second discounts for transportation have been limitedto Standard A Priority over  pounds and parts of Standard BThere are no dropship discounts in Express Mail none in FirstClass limited ones in Periodicals and none in Special Standard orLibrary Rate Furthermore even the dropship discounts in StandardA are limited For example mail traveling  miles to get to adestination facility gets the same dropship discount as similarmail traveling  miles Similarly  truckloads of mail weighing ounces per piece get the same dropship discount as  truckload ofmail weighing  ounce per piece Clearly the Postal Service coulddo more to transfer some of these operations to the private sectorthrough worksharing discountsAnother way to shift work to the private sector is throughcontracts with suppliers This also has been done For examplecontractors who submit the lowest bids do nearly all of thelonghaul trucking Similarly air transportation is provided undercontract and a sorting hub for Express Mail is operated undercontract A number of contract stations also exist for retailservices There may however be limits to how much contracting canbe done effectively partly because of the time and cost associatedwith utilizing placing and monitoring contractsConsider the contract the Postal Service now has with EmeryWorldwide to process and transport Priority Mail The idea was forthe low bidder to operate a highly focused sorting andtransportation system designed to get Priority Mail delivered ontime Suppose however with suitable reverence to Adam Smith onelooks at this plan according to its degree of roundaboutness Hereis what happens  the Postal Service collects the pieces andbrings them to a central point  The Postal Service goes througha sorting process to separate those pieces that go to Emery Emery picks up the pieces at the cutoff time and transports them toits own facility  The pieces are unloaded and fed into sortingmachines  After sorting the pieces are transported to an airfacility and then sent by air to a destination possibly usinglowercapacity equipment than the Postal Service might use  Thepieces are loaded on a truck and transported to a Postal Servicefacility  The Postal Service integrates the pieces back into itsown system and takes them to the facility out of which the carriersoperate This sounds like a lot of steps Taking a degree ofwriters license the alternative is to leave them in the postalsystem sort them first transport them immediately and deliverthemThe jury is still out on the effectiveness of the Emerycontract There are indications however that Emery is losingmoney that the Postal Service is spending more than if it had donethe work itself and that there has not been a significantimprovement in delivery performance It appears that theroundaboutness and the associated extra steps may be taking a tollWhether this is an effective avenue to lower costs and improveperformance remains to be seenNote that the possibility of contracting out is not limited tooperations prior to delivery If there are economies of scale indelivery and certainly if mail recipients do not want multiplecarriers accessing their mail boxes it would be possible to defineroutes along with their expected workload and auction them off tothe lowest bidder This is already done on a few star routes atabout onehalf the cost of rural carriers and it is reportedlybeing done by competitors of the Postal Services in the parcelarea OReilly COST RECOGNITION IN RATE DESIGNRates for the Postal Service are set following extensivehearings before the Postal Rate Commission Voluminous testimony isprovided as are the results of numerous cost studies In fact thevolume of cost data amounts to tens of thousands of pages Based onthe data and the testimony submitted as well as on evidencesubmitted by dozens of intervenors rates are set in a verydetailed way It is not uncommon for extensive testimony to focuson discount differences of one or two tenths of a cent perpieceDespite all of this attention there are weaknesses in what isknow about costs For example  Little is known about therelative costs of flats and parcels in Priority and Express Mail Not enough is known about the effects of weight on costs inFirst Class and Standard A despite extensive related testimony Knowledge is limited on the relation between weight andnontransportation costs in nearly all subclasses  Not enough isknown about how nontransportation costs vary with distance Based on studies that have been questioned extensively the ratesfor StandardA mail do not vary with weight up to about  ouncesThis means for example that for a large mailing going miles the same postage would be charged for ounce piecesrequiring one tractor trailer as would be charged for ouncepieces requiring four tractor trailers  The extent of lowercosts for highervolume mailers is unknownIf the Postal Service faced competition in all areas some ofthese weaknesses might be associated with cream that could beskimmed A response by the Postal Service would be expectedImproved cost studies would result This is not meant to suggestthat costs have not been studied extensively A great deal of moneyis being spent on cost studies but when the budget for thesestudies is Competitors understand clearly that ounce pieces ofsaturation mail can be carried privately for less than StandardArates while ounce pieces cannotcompared to a revenue that is near  billion the percentageamount is probably minimalWhen it is suggested that the Postal Service should spend moreon cost studies questions arise about private sector expendituresin this area There are at least three possibilities One otherfirms spend more Two most other productive operations are easierto study and understand since few firms have  locations anda large proportion of their workforce working outdoors Threeoperating managers in the private sector based on their extensiveexperience are allowed to prepare mental estimates of what costsprobably are However it would work out it seems clear thatcompetition would improve the alignment of rates and costs COSTS BY DESTINATIONIn recent years a number of studies have analyzed the widelyheld belief that rural routes are more expensive than city routesThe findings confirm the expectation to some extent but the splitis not clean It turns out that the income of the recipients isalso important with many lowincome lowvolume city routes beingunprofitable Cohen  One reason for being concerned aboutthis issue is the possibility that were the Private ExpressStatutes to be relaxed competitors would take the profitableroutes and leave the incumbent administration with the unprofitableroutesIn the same vein mail for the highestvolume recipients is noteven delivered  the mailers pick it up In fact many of theserecipients have unique ZIP Codes and their own sorting bin on thesorting machines The question then becomes would acompetitivepostal service establish rate tiers based on the destination ofthe mail We know for example that Roadway Package Service atleast initially did not solicit mail for residences and that UPScharges extra for addresses designated as residential Also UPSselects certain Zip Codes for an additional surcharge At least forbulk mailers and in a computerized world such rate differencesare easy to manageThe Postal Service could for example place a Roman numeral infront of each ZIP Code yielding a code like I Thenumeral I could indicate a lowcost recipient who picks up mailin bulk The numeral II could indicate locations of averageincome and stop density that are relatively economical to deliverThe numeral III could be for highcost areasRates based on numerals could result even though there would betransaction costs Such a system however might not be the mostdesirable one downside being that the smallest singlepiecemailers could default to a rate that is high enough to cover alldestinations Also to the extent that mailers send broadly to alldestinations a system of this kind would not change postage billsit would just increase some rates and decrease othersBefore leaving the question of highercost delivery areas itshould be noted that a mitigating option might be to reduce thenumber of deliveries per week Cohen  Although many observerswould view this as an extreme step it could reduce costs and allowincreased efficiencies For example mail could be sorted one dayand delivered the next resulting in a less demanding scheduleAlso the effect on the recipient might not be as large as commonlyassumedin effect onehalf of the mail would be delayed onedayA related service issue is whether there are unreasonabletransportation runs that should be eliminated That is a reviewcould be done to see how many transportation runs are scheduledsolely to meet a deadline or a service standard but which involvevery little mail These runs could cost far more than the value ofthe small improvement in service COSTS BY CUSTOMERAlthough the details are kept private it is well known thatmany privatesector firms set rates via contracts with selectedcustomers Sometimes these are based on agreements that thecustomer will prepare the mail in certain ways at other times theyare based on a threat that the mailer will find another carrier Asan economic matter it is clear that a postal service is better offhaving a customer at a nearcost price than not having the customerat allWere the Postal Service to be allowed to set rates undercontracts or to bid for business it would need costs by customerAt the present time costs by customer are not available and theServices costing systems are not set up to develop such costs Inshort this is a whole new costing area that would need to beundertakenIf contract rates with selected customers were allowed severalquestions would need to be addressed First would the terms ofeach agreement be made public The answer is probably yes Secondwould all customers satisfying the requirements of the contract beallowed to use the same rates The answer here is probably yes aswell even though privatesector firms would say no on both pointsThird how rigorous and defensible would customerspecific costshave to be in order to qualify as an acceptable base for acontract and would the costing receive review by any outsideparty One is tempted to argue that there should be a defensiblestudy but the problem is obvious some private firms undoubtedlybase contracts on the judgment of the managers involvedFurthermore the result can be based on negotiating skillsThe prospect of allowing contract prices in a government postalservice based on judgment and negotiating skills raises anotherquestion Specifically private firms have stockholders Ifdiscounts are too large the stockholders pay along with managerswho may lose their jobs Whether a government postal service canengage in these kinds of negotiations deserves serious study INVERSE PRICE CAPSIf the Postal Service should have a greater degree of pricingfreedom and be able to engage in negotiations with selectedmailers one way to provide such freedom even without furtherchanges would be to allow the Postal Service to operate underinverse price capsWithin the existing ratesetting framework the idea of aninverse price cap is to allow the Commission to recommend anaverage price level or index that is viewed as a floor Then thePostal Service could make wideranging adjustments of the rates inthe subclass including contract rates for some of the subclassusers as long as the average rate for the subclass does not gobelow the inverse cap If the Commission believed that a low markupfor the subclasses was in order then the low markup could berecommended Full review would be provided and all affected partieswould have an opportunity to be heard This is an alternative tosome recent legislative suggestions that the markup on thecompetitive subclasses as a group must be at least as large as themarkup on all other subclassesThe inverse price cap is a relatively simple notion that wouldrequire no more than a minor adjustment to the law if one isneeded at all It deserves further study Within the framework ofthis paper it could play a role as well Specifically supposeunconstrained competition were allowed but the Postal Serviceturned out to have sufficient market power in some product areas toallow other products to be priced at or near the level ofincremental cost If this was viewed as unfair competition anindependent regulatory commission could establish and monitorcertain inverse price caps This would provide substantial freedomto compete but within a constrained framework HAVING A GOVERNMENT PROVIDEROne of the questions of this paper is whether the Postal Servicecould become a sustainable monopoly if all protection were removedThere are both disadvantages and advantages to having a singlegovernment provider under these conditions Among the disadvantagesare that the degree of innovation and product differentiation mightcontinue to be limited On the advantages side severalconsiderations are relevant The Postal Service has established thezones and the ZIP Codes that are now used by all carriers It alsomanages a forwarding system and a changeofaddress system bothof which honor policies on privacy In addition it carries mailthat is sealed against inspection and acts as a watchdog overfraudulent use of the mailsIf desired having one carrier would allow the maintenance ofthe mailbox rule with as discussed above a reduction incompetitive pressure which in turn would be helpful in protectingthe mail Also residents could leave originating mail in theirboxes and know who would pick it up and that it would be handledappropriately Having one carrier would also reduce vehicle trafficin neighborhoods and allow familiarity with recipients Such acarrier can deal better with irregularities and can watch over thedelivery area If competition was allowed and competitors arose it might bethat a changeofaddress system could be operated by a separateentity and made available to all competitors This is reportedlybeing done in Sweden CONCLUSIONIt is a common belief that the Private Express Statutes and themailbox rule serve as protection to allow universal service atuniform rates When viewed in terms of changes the Postal Servicewould likely make if it wished to make itself into a sustainablemonopoly it becomes clear that these restrictions protect muchmore than just universal service They also protect the preferredsubclasses of mail low rates for Periodicals classifications thatare not market based rates that do not follow costs and a rangeof other practices discussed in this paper If these are notinherently desirable or if a decision were made to give them lessweight changes could be made to eliminate them now even withoutrelaxing the Statutes If some of them are desirable but notothers limited changes could be made one possibility beinginverse price capsThere are however benefits to having a government postalservice in addition to the uniform rates and special ratestructures Specifically the Postal Service establishes the zonesand the ZIP Codes guards privacy forwards mail and protectsagainst crime Also having one postal system reduces traffic andpollution Further if the mailbox rule were maintained only oneperson will pick up an outgoing letter placed in the mailboxFurther analysis is needed of the benefits of the current systemrelative to the benefits of an alternative system and of whethersome of the benefits of an alternative system can be obtained bymaking adjustments to the current systemReferencesCrew Michael A and Paul R Kleindorfer  Pricing
