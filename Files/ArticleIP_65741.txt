                                 Clintons Bucket of Cold Water            In aneditorial Friday the Jerusalem Post found encouragement in Syrian Foreign MinisterFarouk Sharas speech at the White House Wednesday despite his frostiness andhis unexpected refusal to shake the Israeli prime ministers hand What theworld saw it said was a continuation of the coldest shoulder of the MiddleEast that of Syria toward Israel But his words revealed welcome changes inSyrias approach to peace The most significant of these was his statement thatthe SyriaIsrael conflict was about borders and not about Israels right toexist The words border conflict combined with the concept of peace basedupon international legitimacya phrase Shara used twicesignifies a shiftin conception that Israel has been seeking since the day of its birth thePost said Shara also implied that a peace settlement might be a boonas opposed to a setback for Arab unity and he gave a broader than expecteddescription of what peace might be like He spoke of a peace that would opennew horizons for totally new relations between peoples and of honorablecompetition in various domainsthe political cultural scientific andeconomic This the Post said suggested a peace much broader anddeeper than the exchange of ambassadors and other formalities            TheJerusalem Post s lead Friday was a reported promise by Shara not to allowany element in Lebanon to disrupt the peace process which was described by asenior Israeli official as the first clear indication that Syria is willing torein in Hezbollah terrorists In its mainstory from Washington Friday Haaretzsaid Syria has called on the United States to remove Syria immediately from itslist of regimes that sponsor terrorism The paper said that while the UnitedStates is demanding that Syria take action against Hezbollah first there aresigns of Syrian crackdowns on terror groups currently based in Syria as wellas Hezbollah It also reported that if Israel is satisfied with the progressof the peace negotiations due to begin Jan  Jewish organizations in theUS would become involved in the lobbying effort to get Syria removed from thelist clearing the way for Congressionalbacked aid to Damascus            In aneditorial Haaretz said it is clear that thenegotiations have already reached an advanced stage and that with good willon both sides everything is resolvable But it said there is still the problemof the Jewish settlements on the Golan Heights which Israel would return toSyria in a peace settlement The residents of the Golan were sent to buildtheir homes opposite Syria with the concurrence of every government since and the roots they struck in the basalt soil are deeper than those of thesettlers in Judea and Samaria the paper said But it concluded that they willhave to go because peace under reasonable conditions is more important thanthe desire to ease the pain of the settlers who are evacuated from theirhomes Another article in Haaretz Friday called for understandingby the Israelis of Syrias difficult task of preparing Syrian public opinionfor peace with Israel If the settlement goes ahead Syria will be requiredwithin months to present the Syrian public with new facts completely contraryto the ideology preached to them for decades it said                           AlBaath  the daily paper of Syrias ruling party said Thursday thatSyria wouldnt give up a grain of its soil or a drop of its water in itsnegotiations with Israel Syria fought honorably and it is now negotiatinghonorably the paper said It is doing all it can to attain an honorablepeace which safeguards rights dignity and sovereignty That is the only peaceacceptable to our people and that is the peace that will prove viable andstand the test of time The PanArab daily alQuds alArabi urged Syriato consider the implications of Sharas vision of scientific economic andcultural competition with Israel One cannot engage in this competitionwithout swiftly adopting and applying its ABC starting with democracy freedomto engage in political activity freedom of expression and economicliberalization the paper said Syria cannot compete with Israel intechnology when access to the Internet is restricted to the children of seniorofficials and the use of a mobile phone must be cleared by the intelligenceservices                           AlQuds alArabi was one of several Arab papers skeptical about theIsraeliSyrian rapprochement Disputing Sharas statement that a peaceagreement would mean the end of a history of wars and conflicts it notedthat he failed to say a word about the future of Jerusalem and thePalestinians and it added An end to the state of war between Arabgovernments and Israel does not mean an end to the state of war between theArab people and the Jewish state This is because the Arab governments signingup to peace were not democratically elected nor did they conduct referendumson their peace moves            The PanArabalHayat said the Palestinians had been wrong to believe that they couldnegotiate on their own with Israel They had only themselves to blame for thefact that their peace negotiations were stalled while Syrias were picking upagain The semiofficial Cairo newspaper alAhram said that BillClintons coup in getting the Syrians and Israelis together was a cruel blowto the candidateswhether Democrat or Republicanfighting to succeed himClinton wanted to pour a bucket of freezing cold water on the hopes of hispotential successors Al Gore and George W Bush who both want him to failThey want the kudos for themselves especially since they have both alreadymade promises in advance to the Israelis and the American Jewish lobby in orderto secure support in the presidential election
