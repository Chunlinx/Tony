                    Background        In response to local infection with necrotizing        pathogen plants display a whole plant enhanced immunity to        secondary challenge systemic acquired resistance or SAR            A characteristic set of genes termed        pathogenesisrelated          PR  is induced both locally and in        distal tissues in parallel with SAR induction            Accumulation of salicylic acid SA has been shown to be        necessary for induction of SAR            The Arabidopsis         ndr mutant showed drastically        impaired induction of SAR and         PR gene expression in response to        infection with         Pseudomonas syringae bacteria        carrying the avirulence          avr  gene         avrRpt     This mutant is also        incapable of showing a hypersensitive response HR to        these bacteria     except at very high levels of        inoculum     The HR is a macroscopic leaf collapse The        HR occurs in response to infection with avirulent bacteria        at levels of inoculum that cause a large percentage of leaf        cells to undergo programmed cell death PCD     In        contrast to results with         avrRpt P syringae bacteria        carrying the avirulence genes         avrB          avrRpm          avrPphB or         avrRps elicit an exaggerated HR        relative to that on the wildtype Columbia parent             In a study in which bacteria carrying         avrB were chosen as a representative        member of this class in further contrast to results with         avrRpt  these bacteria were capable        of eliciting SAR and         PR induction on         ndr mutant plants            However induction of SA accumulation by         ndr mutant plants was impaired at        early time points to a similar extent in response to        bacteria carrying either         avr gene     These results        suggested that at least two pathways control SAR and         PR gene expression One pathway is        directly dependent on SA accumulation The second pathway        is not directly dependent on SA levels The correlation        between ability to elicit the HR and to elicit SAR and         PR induction led to the model that        the second pathway was caused by signals associated with        hypersensitive cell death Despite the severe impairment in        SA accumulation within the first  hours postinoculation        of         ndr plants bacteria carrying         avrB could nonetheless induce         PR gene expression and SAR because of        the HRassociated pathway Bacteria carrying         avrRpt could not because both        pathways were impaired by the         ndr mutation This study could not        address the question as to whether the HRassociated        pathway alone was sufficient to induce SAR and         PR because SA accumulation did        occur late in the response        Induction of SAR has been reported to be dependent upon        the         NPR gene       In these        studies neither SASA analogs nor avirulent bacteria were        able to induce SAR on         npr mutant plants The biological        inducer of SAR tested in these experiments was         P syringae bacteria carrying         avrRpt  In contrast to         ndr plants         npr plants do show the HR in        response to         P syringae carrying         avrRpt data not shown These        results could be taken to suggest that the HRassociated        pathway is not sufficient to induce SAR in the absence of        the         NPR dependent SAassociated        pathway but see below for why this conclusion is not        correct        In contrast to SAR induction induction of         PR by avirulent bacteria has been        shown to occur in         npr mutants     It is however        reduced in extent and delayed If         npr mutants are indeed fully blocked        in SAR induction then the pathways leading to         PR induction can not be the same as        those leading to SAR However we have argued on the basis        of results with         ndr mutant plants that HR        triggering in response to the         avrRpt          RPS combination is weaker than that        in response to         avrB          RPM     Weaker triggering        results in a lower probability of individual cells        undergoing PCD early in the HR prior to the onset of        potentiation caused by increased SA levels             Signaling elicited by         avrRpt clearly differs in many        respects from that directed by the other         avr genes Use of bacteria carrying         avrB to elicit SAR would allow a more        rigorous test of whether the         NPR dependent pathway is essential        for SAR induction        To clarify the signaling circuitry governing SAR and         PR gene induction we have        constructed a         ndr          npr double mutant This line was        compared with wildtype Columbia Arabidopsis and both        single mutant lines for the ability to display biological        induction of SAR and         PR gene expression We conclude that        SAR         PR induction and         PR induction are regulated in        parallel by the two pathways we have previously delineated            but the effects of these pathways are additive        rather than obligatorily synergistic Moreover additional        pathways also contribute additively to         PR induction                    Results                  Systemic acquired resistance elicited by DC          avrB          If           NPR is truly essential for SAR                        npr mutant plants should not be          able to undergo SAR in response to           P syringae pv tomato DC          hereafter DC carrying           avrB  Alternatively if          HRassociated signals leading to SAR act independently of                    NPR  DC           avrB might be able to elicit SAR on                    npr plants The results of this          experiment are presented in Figure  Columbia wild type          plants showed a three order of magnitude reduction in          growth of virulent bacteria in plants that had received a          prior inoculation with DC           avrB  SAR was also displayed by           ndr mutant plants These results          are comparable to those published previously              Clear SAR was also displayed by the           npr mutant The SAR response was          statistically significant Students           t test           P   for all three lines in          this experiment and in a replicate experiment This assay          is not sufficiently sensitive to quantitate small          differences in SAR between the lines However it is          clear that all three lines did display SAR As it is          likely that both mutant lines are null alleles          previously established for           ndr    and argued below for           npr  the hypothesis that           NPR is essential for SAR is thus          rejected          To test epistasis relationships between these mutants          a double mutant was constructed see Methods The double          mutant was also tested for SAR in response to DC           avrB Figure  Statistically          significant SAR was seen at the two day time point but          not at the four day time point Students           t test           P   In a replicate          experiment SAR was statistically significant only at the          four day time point The combination of the two mutations          was thus sufficient to abolish most of the SAR response          Residual SAR may have been due to HRassociated signals          in that the double mutant did display a HR to DC           avrB  The macroscopic HR phenotype          was exaggerated like that of the           ndr single mutant data not          shown                          Induction of PR gene expression in response to          DC avrBand DC avrRpt          We have previously argued that           PR gene expression is controlled          by two separate pathways     One pathway results from          SA accumulation and is dependent upon the NPR gene          product The second pathway results from signals          correlated with the HR and is           NPR independent The           ndrnpr double mutant was          used to further test this hypothesis          The double mutant each single mutant and Columbia          wildtype plants were infected with    bacteria mL           At this level of inoculum most leaf cells did not          undergo PCD data not shown Macroscopic tissue collapse          was therefore not seen allowing           PR gene expression to be          quantitated using Northern blots The data is presented          in Figure  Columbia wildtype Arabidopsis showed high          levels of           PR induction in response to          either DC           avrB or DC           avrRpt  The level of           PR induction shown by either          single mutant line in response to either bacterial strain          was greatly reduced relative to that shown by Columbia          However both single mutants still showed           PR induction at the two day time          point in response to either bacterial strain The level          of           PR induction shown by the double          mutant in response to DC           avrRpt was not significantly          different from that shown in response to either          DCempty vector or the MgCl            blank Students           t test           P   In this experiment          when there was no PCD and NPR activity was blocked by          mutation no induction of           PR resulted By contrast DC                    avrB did elicit highly significant           PR induction Students           t test           P   for comparison to          DCempty vector or blank As NPR activity was          blocked by mutation PCDassociated signals likely          explain the residual           PR induction These results          confirm the original model that the two pathways for           PR induction are additive                          Induction of PR gene expression in response to          DC avrBand DC avrRpt          The two postulated pathways acting in an additive          fashion sufficed to explain bacterial induction of SAR          and           PR gene expression Experiments          were next undertaken to extend the model to the control          of           PR induction DC           avrRpt or DC           avrB were inoculated into           ndrnpr double mutant plants          the single mutants or the Columbia wild type plants           PR gene expression was          quantitated by Northern blots The data is presented in          Figure  At the one day time point the double mutant          showed significant impairment in           PR induction relative to wild          type in response to either avirulent bacterial strain          Students           t test           P   However at the two          day time point only the impairment in response to          DC           avrRpt was statistically          significant at this level If the criteria for          statistically significant differences was relaxed to P            then the same qualitative picture was shown as          with           PR in comparison of single          mutants to wild type Columbia Columbia plants showed          differences at this level of significance from           ndr or           npr plants in induction of           PR in response to DC           avrRpt at both time points These          results are consistent with contributions to           PR induction coming from both the          HRassociated pathway and the SA           NPR dependent pathway However           PR gene expression occurred in          spite of blockade of both pathways in experiments with          DC           avrRpt and the double mutant This          result was very different from what was seen with           PR induction or SAR Clearly the          two pathways we have delineated do not constitute a          complete picture of signaling leading to           PR gene expression                            Discussion                PR genes are thought to be tightly        associated with SAR because they are coregulated with SAR            and because many         PR gene products have been shown to        have antimicrobial activity     The complete impairment        of         npr plants in SAR induction    as        contrasted with a partial impairment in         PR induction    in response to         P syringae carrying         avrRpt challenged the hypothesis of        coregulation However         avrRpt was shown to differ markedly        from the other characterized         P syringae avr genes in the        responses it elicited on         ndr mutant plants       The        apparent challenge to the hypothesis of coregulation could        have been because of the choice of an atypical         avr gene Therefore SAR and         PR gene expression of         npr mutant plants were assessed in        response to a second         avr gene          avrB  Markedly different results        were obtained Mutant         npr plants were not fully impaired        in induction of SAR         PR gene expression or         PR gene expression in response to         P syringae carrying         avrB  These results are consistent        with the hypothesis of coregulation The apparent         NPR dependence of SAR induction in        response to bacteria carrying         avrRpt is likely quantitative rather        than qualitative        A potential alternative explanation for these results        might be residual function of mutant gene products in the        plant lines used The         ndr mutant is an unambiguous null        mutant in that a deletion removes most of the coding region        and the proximal promoter region     However none of        the characterized         npr mutants have a large deletion             As such attempts to define allelic series have        relied upon the level of residual function associated with        these mutants in assays of gene expression or fungal        disease resistance      However the complexity of        signaling leading to these outputs complicates analyses of        these phenotypes A null mutant might still show gene        expression or disease resistance caused by pathways that do        not require the corresponding gene product        What is required is an assay where the output is due        solely to an         NPR dependent pathway The        experiment presented in Figure provided such data The        combination of         npr with         ndr in a double mutant prevented        the         avrRpt elicited HR under the        conditions used Under these conditions DC         avrRpt failed to elicit any         PR gene expression the level was        statistically indistinguishable from that seen with        inoculation of a MgCl          blank Impairment of SA accumulation        in the double mutant Zhang Gutsche and Shapiro        manuscript in preparation resembled that in the         ndr single mutant    at early        time points prior to the onset of         NPR dependent negative feedback on        SA accumulation      Nonetheless SA accumulation        likely occurred by the time points taken in SAR and PR gene        expression experiments reported herein        This assay depends solely on NPR function The complete        lack of         PR induction supports our        contention that         npr is indeed a null mutant or        perhaps a severe hypomorph This contention is further        supported by published data showing that the         npr allele failed to interact with        putative target TGA transcription factor genes in a        twohybrid assay    or in an         in vivo  reporter genebased assay            The treatment of         npr seedlings with exogenous SA        failed to induce increases in         PR gene expression under some        experimental conditions    albeit not under all        conditions     The potential alternative explanation        that results presented herein were caused by residual gene        product function in the mutant lines used is thus not        correct        The idea that SAR and         PR gene expression are coregulated        has also been challenged by experiments with the         eds and         sid mutants     These mutants        have been implicated in SA biosynthesis They showed        impairments in         PR induction in response to        bacteria that were very similar to those displayed by         ndr plants but marginal if any        impairment in         PR or         PR induction Direct comparison        with results presented here required addressing an issue        with the potential to affect interpretation of that study        In that study         PR gene expression was quantitated        from uninfected parts of leaves that had been infected with           mL DC         avrRpt  This level of inoculum was        sufficiently high to cause false positive spurious        HRlike responses to DCempty vector     Indeed        when         sid mutant plants were inoculated        with    mL DC         avrRpt  no HR was seen data not        shown        The high levels of inoculum used in the cited study can        only be used without causing false positive HRs if a        bacterial strain that is not a pathogen of Arabidopsis is        used to deliver the avr gene product      When         sid plants were inoculated with           mL of a nonpathogen strain          P syringae pv         glycinea Race  carrying         avrRpt  HRs were seen data not        shown The identical results with the two bacterial strain        backgrounds imply that the cited results with         sid mutant plants were obtained        under conditions in which high levels of bacterial inoculum        overcame some effects of the mutation The         ndr mutation can also be overcome        at high levels of inoculum However the level at which         ndr phenotypes are overcome is        higher than that for         sid phenotypes in that    mL        of a nonpathogen strain carrying         avrRpt is required to yield        reproducible HRs on         ndr plants            Clearly the interpretation of results with         PR induction depends critically on        the experimental design The relatively unimpaired         PR and         PR induction in         sid plants might imply that the        HRassociated signals were quantitatively more important        than the SAassociated signals The same two pathways        invoked to explain SAR and         PR induction could potentially        account for         PR and         PR induction if this assumption        were correct        The results presented herein however argue strongly        that         PR induction is indeed regulated        differently than SAR or         PR induction The two pathways        identified as making the major contributions to         PR and SAR induction were shown to        contribute to         PR induction However significant         PR induction occurred in the double        mutant in response to DC         avrRpt Figure  DC         avrRpt elicited HRs on Columbia or         npr plants but not on         ndr plants or double mutant plants        data not shown As such these results can not be        explained by HRassociated signals or SAassociated         NPR dependent signals There must        be additional pathways contributing to         PR induction This conclusion is        consistent with the original interpretation of         PR gene expression data in         eds and         sid mutants that         PR and         PR are regulated differently                   The data presented in Figures and suggest that there        must be at least two additional pathways contributing to         PR induction DCempty vector        did not elicit significant         PR induction on the double mutant        at either time point Students         t test         P   However the analogous        experiment with         PR induction gave the opposite        results Moreover at both time points the         PR induction elicited by infection        with DCempty vector was to a similar extent regardless        of allele status at the         NDR or         NPR loci no statistically        significant differences Students         t test         P   These bacteria elicited                PR gene expression in spite of the        absence of a functional         avr gene the absence of PCD and        mutations in both the         NPR and         NDR genes As even         E coli has been shown to induce        plant defenserelated gene expression     it should        not be surprising that bacteria can elicit changes in plant        gene expression via many different signaling pathways        Indeed conserved features of bacteria can act as elicitors        of gene expression through pathways distinct from those        associated with geneforgene disease resistance                   However an additional pathway leading to         PR gene expression that stems from         avrRpt function must also exist        DC         avrRpt elicited no statistically        significant induction of         PR by the double mutant at either        time point Students         t test         P   However clear        induction of         PR was seen in the analogous        experiment The level of         PR induction was higher than in        response to DCempty vector Students         t test         P   As the double mutant        was susceptible to disease caused by this bacterial strain        data not shown perhaps this residual gene induction was        due to the virulence function of         avrRpt     Mutant         npr plants have previously been        shown to be impaired in induction of         PR but not         PR in response to virulent        bacterial pathogen            These details are presented in a model of the signaling        network for induction of SAR         PR gene expression and         PR gene expression by avirulent         P syringae bacteria Figure  We        have used a representation scheme proposed recently for        plant signal transduction networks that is based on Boolean        formalisms used in engineering and computer science            Either of two generators shown can elicit signaling        One generator is infection of plants carrying a functional         RPS allele with bacteria carrying         avrRpt  The second generator is        infection of plants carrying a functional         RPM allele with bacteria carrying         avrB  An or gate is used to show        that either way of eliciting signaling resulted in        accumulation of SA The         NDR allele status was represented        with a switch The         ndr allele was pictured as        analogous to an electrical switch where the contact is in        an open position impairing early SA accumulation        The HR progresses more slowly in response to         avrRpt than in response to         avrB       Evidence has been        presented however that differences between HRs are not        merely differences in kinetics     As such the         avrRpt elicited HR and the         avrB elicited HR were pictured as        two separate components When assayed under standard        conditions         ndr mutant plants did not show the                avrRpt elicited HR An and gate        was used to show that both infection with bacteria carrying                avrRpt and early accumulation of SA        were needed to give the characteristic slow HR By        contrast         ndr mutant plants did show the HR        to bacteria carrying         avrB  A straight line that is not        connected via a gate to SA accumulation thus leads to Fast        HRassociated signals        SAR is gated by an or gate with three possible inputs        As DC         avrB elicited SAR on the         ndr          npr double mutant neither of        these gene products was essential for SAR induction The        early SA accumulation was not likely to have been essential        either because that was markedly impaired by the         ndr mutation However the        characteristic         avrB elicited fast HR did occur        in the double mutant As such a straight line deriving        from Fast HRassociated signals is one of the inputs to        this or gate Another input is an and gate The        evidence requiring this gate is that SAR elicited by        DC         avrRpt was prevented by either a         npr mutation    or a         ndr mutation     We conclude        that the characteristic         avrRpt elicited slow HR can only        contribute to SAR in combination with         NPR dependent early SAelicited        signaling necessitating the and gate The final input is        SAelicited         NPR dependent signaling acting        alone                    PR induction is also gated by an        or gate with three alternative inputs The Fast HR        alone this study the slow HR alone     or        SAelicited         NPR dependent signaling             were each sufficient by themselves to give         PR induction Induction of         PR gene expression can also be via        any of these three inputs acting independently However we        this study and others     have presented evidence        that other pathways can also contribute to         PR induction As such         PR is gated by an or gate One        input is a branch point from the or gate leading to         PR induction The second input is        pictured as a question mark Evidence has been presented        herein that this second input represents at least two        pathways However the details of these pathways are not        known and are thus not pictured        No attempt has been made to represent the kinetics of        signaling events in Figure  Boolean formalism can        incorporate kinetic information through use of gating        delays Differential equationsbased kinetic modeling is an        alternative means of capturing the rich dynamics of        signaling networks      As timeresolved data sets        become available and feedback loops are delineated it may        be necessary to use these methods to understand system        dynamics and control     However the authors agree        with Genoud et al  that the scheme used in that        work and in Figure of this paper has advantages for        representing the topology of signaling networks This        formalism allows clear differentiation of additive from        obligatorily synergistic signaling interactions through use        of or and and gates respectively                    Conclusions        In conclusion the additive effects of two pathways        explain most if not all induction of SAR and         PR gene expression by the avirulent        bacteria examined One of these pathways stems from signals        associated with hypersensitive cell death and is         NPR independent The other pathway        stems from SA accumulation and signals through         NPR  By contrast         PR induction by avirulent bacteria        involves at least two additional pathways that also act in        an additive fashion                    Methods                  Bacteria and plant growth                    Pseudomonas syringae

ndrnprdouble          mutant line          The           ndr            npr double mutant was generated          using pollen from a           npr plant to fertilize flowers          of a           ndrgl plant The success of          the cross was validated by the hairy nonglabrous          phenotype of leaves of the F            plant DNA was prepared from leaves          of week old F

     except that hand inoculation using a syringe was          used instead of vacuum infiltration to introduce the          challenge pathogen Triplicate samples of four leaf disks          each were used on Day  and quintuplicate samples were          used on Days  and  Error bars represent standard          deviations of data means Significance of differences          between means at a given time point were determined using          Students           t tests Values of           P were read from a           t table A replicate experiment          gave comparable results In accordance with established          practice in the field     data was not combined          between the two replicate experiments                          Northern analysis          Plant growth and inoculations were as described for          SAR experiments Leaf tissue samples were collected at          indicated time points Samples were flash frozen in          liquid nitrogen and total RNA was isolated
