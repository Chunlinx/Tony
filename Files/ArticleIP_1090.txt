                                 Feminism Clinton and Harassment            Last month feministforemother Gloria Steinem took to the New York Times oped page to arguethat the sexual harassment laws should not protect Paula Jones Steinemsposition was roundly dismissed as a scholastic contortion of logic performedto protect her ideological friend Bill Clinton Conservatives gloated over thefeminists hypocrisy on sexual harassment the movements sacred cow No lessthan the New York Times editorial page accused Steinem of selling outher cause Did Steinem and the feminists sacrifice their principles to protectBill Clinton What are the different feminist schools of thought on sexualharassment How have they changed postClinton            Here indescending order of sternness are the five major groups for a refresher onharassment law and its history click              MacKinnonites This the socalled radical feministposition is trumpeted primarily by academics who take their cues from lawprofessor Catharine MacKinnon who holds appointments at the law schools of theuniversities of Michigan and Chicago MacKinnon argues that sexual harassmentlaws are a necessary corrective to the oppressive patriarchy of the workplaceand she wants current laws stiffened For instance she would prohibit men fromhaving sex with subordinate female coworkers MacKinnonites believe that thedisparities of power in these relationships render them exploitative bydefinition            MacKinnons position however is hardly fringe While a grad student at Yaleshe formulated the theory behind the current practice of sexual harassmentlawthat the employment discrimination protections in the  Civil RightsAct could be used to regulate workplace behavior such as dirty jokes andunwelcome advances MacKinnon argues that many journalists distort her work bycaricaturing her as a neopuritan To prove her reasonableness she concedesthat Clinton shouldnt be prosecutedat least not for sexually harassingMonica Lewinsky The Lewinsky affair she believes has sparked a hystericalbacklash against sexual harassment laws                            NOWistas Mainstream womens groupswouldnt go as far as the MacKinnonites and prohibit all sexual contact betweensuperiors and subordinates But with the Clarence Thomas  and BobPackwood  controversies these groups took the stance that femaleaccusers always deserve the presumption of veracity in sexual harassment casesWomen they claimed dont make these things up And feminists have anobligation to counter the prevailing tendency to dismiss accusers as nutty andslutty But when it came to Paula Jones only a handful of feministsegThe Nation columnist Katha Pollittconsistently supported her case withsimilar arguments Initially most womens groupsnotably the NationalOrganization for Womenmaintained a calculated silence Only after months ofthe press chiding them for their double standard did the groups begin toinvoke the presumption on behalf of Kathleen Willey            Now thatit appears the Jones case will do Clinton no harm feminist groups have becomemore vocal NOW President Patricia Ireland worries publicly that the dismissalof the Jones case will deter other women from bringing sexual harassmentclaims Jones case illustrates how difficult it is for a woman to get her dayin court Ireland and others also worry about a possible tumble down a slipperyslope with men making passes at women now that they have seen Clinton get awaywith it                            Strict Constructionists This group led by Yale LawSchool Professor Vicki Schultz argues that harassment law unhealthily obsessesover sex in the workplace Conservative judges Schultz argues have usedsexual harassment law as a pretext for preserving womens virtue And inprecedentsetting decisions judges imply that there is no such thing asharassment if there is no sex involved This she argues has led these judgesto discount the types of employment discriminationunfair promotion practiceworkplace taunts etcthe law was originally intended to check Pundits tendto like the Schultz position because it allows them to continue to defend theidea of sexual harassment law while attacking cases like Paula Jones whichfocuses on an alleged sexual act but makes no convincing showing of damage toher career             One Free Passers In her nownotorious opedGloria Steinem argued that Clinton should not be penalized for his boorishcomeons Sexual harassment she claims was born out of the feministproposition that with sexual advances no means no yes means yes And whenJones and Willey said no Clinton backed off Steinem and others in her campsuch as Backlash author Susan Faludi argue there is no inconsistencybetween their support of Clinton and condemnations of Packwood and ThomasUnlike Clinton they argue Packwood and Thomas interpreted no as yes andrepeated their unwelcome advances although most of Packwoods alleged passeswere single tries Steinems distinction is one side of a longstanding legaldebate over whether a onetime unwelcome advance is enough to create a hostileworking environment The courts divide on whether a onetime deed issufficient but many feminist legal thinkers take Steinems side                            Libertarian Hedonists The libhedposition goes a step beyond the strict constructionist position Articulated byselfproclaimed iconoclasts such as Camille Paglia and Katie Roiphe it arguesthat weve become paranoid about sexual harassment criminalizing consensualoffice sex and flirtation Libheds
