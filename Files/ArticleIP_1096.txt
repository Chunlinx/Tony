                                 Why Are We Using Chinese Rockets            Thelatest scandal to implicate the Clinton White House revolves around accusationsthat the president gave aerospace giant Loral Space Communicationsheaded by the Democratic National Committees biggest donor inthe  campaign cyclespecial permission to export satellites to Chinadespite Justice Department opposition Even if there is no actual evidence of aquid donations pro quo permission to export these allegations raisequestions Why would a US company launch satellites on Chinese rockets Whynot use American ones And if the rockets that launch satellites and nuclearmissiles are fundamentally the same why would the United States authorizecooperation with Chinas national aerospace company which has clear links tothe military                           Background In anticipation of a boomingmarket US satellite companies began contracting launches with China in themids To punish Chinas  Tiananmen Square crackdown the USgovernment prohibited the launch of American commercial satellites on Chineserockets except with a presidentially granted exemption The Bushadministration however granted waivers to the sanctions that soon put most ofthe contracts back on track Bush urged on by Newt Gingrich and otherRepublican leaders on Capitol Hill authorized the export of nine USsatellites for Chinese launch In fact sanctions changed little The exportof satellites to any country has always required government approval            As asenator Al Gore was the most vociferous critic of these waivers  Clickto read his criticisms from  Clinton campaigned against them Howeveraggressive lobbying by satellite manufacturers persuaded Clinton and Gore toreverse their position They have granted waivers for the launch of  moresatellites No application for a waiver has ever been deniedby anyadministration Last month before this scandal broke Clinton aides told theChristian Science Monitor that they hoped that the administration wouldsoon eliminate these sanctions altogether Click for a rundown of the specificactions by Loral that underlie the current controversy                           Why do US companies use Chineserockets American commercial satellite manufacturers of which Loral is thethird largest do not rely on China for most of their launches In the sametwoyear period that China sent two Loral satellites into space Loral launcheddozens of others on Russian French and American rockets Although Chinacurrently launches relatively few satellites Loral like its competitorsHughes and Lockheed Martin aims to increase its use of Chinese rockets forseveral reasons                            Cutrate pricesChina charges about half the rate of Russiaits least expensive competitor million vs  for a comparable launch Attribute this in part tomassive government subsidies given to Great Wall Chinas national aerospacecompany More important to restore business that China lost after a spate ofrocket crashes in  and  Great Wall slashed launch prices In the earlys the Chinese launched three to four satellites a year Last year they onlymanaged the successful launch of a single satellite for the Philippines                            Rocket shortageThe proliferation of cell phones digital television etc has caused thedemand for launches to outstrip the supply of rockets This shortage forcessatellite companies to exploit all available opportunities US export policyexacerbates the dearth To protect its aerospace industry US quotas for thisdecade allow American companies to arrange only  launches with each of theFrench Russian Ukrainian and Chinese national aerospace companies                           NASA policy Fixated on politically popular manned flights NASA hasdevoted most of its resources to highly expensive Space Shuttle flights NASAneglected development of the cheap disposable reliable rockets that othercountries pursued When the Reagan administration began authorizing commercialspace launches in the mids American aerospace companies which typicallycollaborated on massive government projects werent equipped to build entirerockets for commercial use The companies are still catching up and are notnearly as well stocked as their Russian and French competitors                           Is it dangerous for the United States to useChinese rockets It is indisputable that the technology used to launchcommercial satellites is largely indistinguishable from the technology used tolaunch missiles Like Russia and the United States China ripped off itscommercial space capabilities from its weapons program Chinas commercialrocket the Long March and its intercontinental ballistic missiles useprecisely the same rocket boosters and guidance systems Great Wall is partlyowned by the Chinese government and its upper management has intimate ties tothe Chinese militarys top brass            USmanufacturers moreover inevitably acquire a vested interest in improving theaccuracy and reliability of Chinese rockets since failures such as the crash that destroyed Loral and Hughes satellites are very costly In any casein the process of launching US commercial satellites it is unavoidable thatAmericans will transfer some technology to the Chinese  To install asatellite for instance American engineers work with Chinese engineers tosubstantially rewire and reprogram the rocket The law however requires thatDefense Department officials supervise these procedures At least one officialremains with the satellite from the time it leaves the country until itsliftoff            The Clinton administration considers therisks of technology transfers negligible Defense Department officialstold Congress last week that the Chinese have not upgraded their ICBMs since And they dont need tothe  missiles they supposedly have aimed at theUnited States have always been judged capable of hitting US cities by thePentagon though Chinas difficulty in commercial launches casts doubt on thePentagons assessment                           DidLoral harm national security In the wake of the February  Chineserocket crash an executive of a Loral subsidiary chaired a panel composed ofother satellite manufacturers that reviewed the findings of Chineseinvestigators Loral says the review was meant to reassure the insurancecompanies that indemnify their launches on Chinese rockets Loral denies thatits report to the Chinese divulged sensitive information about rocket guidancesystems as a Defense Department report claims The  page report thecompany says merely pointed out that the Chinese rockets had faulty solderingAnd this conclusion Loral claims was neither original nor based on firsthandinvestigation Finally the Chinese say that the State Department impounded theLoral findings before they ever reached them                           If youmissed the links click to read Gores  criticisms and for a breakdown ofthe Loral controversy
