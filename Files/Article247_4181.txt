                                 The Future Aint What It Used To Be                        Dear Dad            For as long as I can remember more than  years reporters have beenasking you to make predictions about the future And you have always given ananswer along the lines of what you told the ABC producer yesterday Itsconvincing and sober and intellectually responsible and it frustrates themto no end Just once perhaps you should give them what they want Watch forthe invention of flying cars in  which will drastically affect the courseof World War III when it breaks out in  Therell be a Mars colony by And by the way make sure to sell all your Xerox stock by next Wednesday            More seriously I have one question for you about all of this and onedemurral The question concerns patterns of technological change As a lot ofcommentators have been noting recently the future isnt what it used to beWhen I was a kid visions of the future were heavy on yes flying cars andMars colonies and the like Everyone was confidently predicting that by theyear  the human race would be well on its way to settling the solar systemwhile at home wed be casually buzzing from continent to continent in our carsand the robot servants took care of cleaning the house            These seemed reasonable enough predictions actually given the pace ofchange up till then in the  th century Its hard to believe thatin just  years less than a lifetime we went from Wilbur and Orville Wrighton the beach at Kitty Hawk to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon years If that pace of change had continued I would probably have been sendingyou this email from Jupiter orbit But it didnt continue In fact its hardnot to think that in a lot of areas technological change has slowed to acrawl with incremental improvements around the edges but no great leapsforward We are  years past Apollo  and have gone from a Moon landing to the space shuttle Thirty years ago we were flying on s and now we areflying on  literally the same airplanes In the United States at leasttransport by car and train is mostly slower than it was then trains are onearea in which the French have beaten us hands downif we had their highspeedTGV train you could come down from Boston to see your grandchildren inWashington with a twohour train ride instead of the sevenplus Amtrakcurrently takes The same is true of other sectors generation of energywhere weve stepped back from nuclear power and even with the exception ofcomputerguided bombs and the like weaponry Where are the stun pistols andblast rays we were supposed to be using by the year  The NRA has missedout on a great slogan here Personal blast rays dont destroy whole cityblocks People destroy whole city blocks            But on the other hand obviously some technological sectors have beenholding to the same incredible pace of change that aeronautics went throughearlier information technology and biotechnology first and foremost Why isthis And how does it relate to the broader structural changes in the economythat you talked about in your message            Heres my demurral Is there really such a thing as primordial identitiesin the way you suggest This is certainly what the presentday nationalistswould like us to think They would like us to imagine that for  years everySerbian mother put her children to bed whispering We must put up with thisregime for now But someday someday Serbia will awake Im sure some of themwere doing exactly that but lots of others adjusted just fine to the communistregime It was only when the regime collapsed that certain people saw anadvantage for themselves in highlighting ethnic and linguistic differences andin not so much resurrecting eternal unchanging primordial identities so muchas creating new identities based on the old myths and loyalties And I thinkthey would probably abandon these new identities easily enough if it suitedthem If the people of Serbia could vote freely and had the choice betweenpossession of Kosovo and membership in the European Union which do you thinkthey would choose            LoveDavid
