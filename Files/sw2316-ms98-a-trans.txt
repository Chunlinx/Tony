        its its hard topic topic because is it is it is it doing a good job or a bad job and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do   yeah and are you talking about public schools being lower level high school level or     well public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to uh uh high school   state school okay but youre excluding highlevel education   yes well yeah i am um actually actually i think that i at the higher level education i dont think theres so much of a problem there its pretty much funded well there are small colleges that im sure are struggling   okay   but uh its the job that the the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area like ours our school even a bad school is a good school up here where if i lived in New York City or Washington DC uh i would seriously consider moving if i had a child i wouldnt let them go to a public school system there but of course people are trapped economically and they cant do that   yeah i know down here the schools are you know i dont know they rate i moved to Arkansas and Texas after living in Ohio and the schools down here rate you know bottom ten percent across the country and having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why because theyre so far behind and so poorly staffed half the time the teachers dont know whats going on   well thats really too bad because it it its giving some people unfair advantage i mean we our high school up here is like a junior college in Florida what we learned   right well that was my experience going through junior high up there when i came down south for high school i was just repeating what id already done   yeah   because we were so far advanced and uh the you know id been in a parochial school before junior high and you know even the public schools are behind the parochial schools   yeah   so you know i i like the concept theyve got now where they have more directed education you know you you pick a career path or you get counseling earlier and then you you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over   oh they they have that down there that   well they talk about it and there are a few in some of the more like in i live in a big metroplex and some of the the better parts of the metroplex the the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools but uh you know   yeah its like if if your father owns a grocery store and youre really interested in that theres no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some general business courses in high school   right or if youre going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art you know theres no point in you know im an engineering student and if i have to go take art classes you know im not going to use them and through high school i could have gone so much further if id gone to a school that was directed   yeah thats where i was fortunate im a im a technician and we had a vocational um electronics in our high school   right in high school   so when i went to my first year of tech school uh i had a very easy time because our high school had a a good program   right i think the schools today you know the public schools are just theyre just overrun you know they dont know what to do theres too many kids and not enough teachers and too many kids dont care   yeah i find that that the that in the in the cities its more less the kids go there   and   to socialize not really to learn and the parents send them there because theyre supposed to and plus it gets them out of their hair and i also find that   right   that you can send a kid to school but if dont work with them as a parent i think youre putting your child at a big disadvantage   yeah and you know theres some kids that you know want to go learn but most of them just want to go play   yeah well i could i could see if a kid doesnt have any encouragement if  theyre you know come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about trying to work and or maybe theyre unemployed and theyre mad at the world i can see where that wouldnt be very good for a a kid you know hes coming up will you help me with my homework and theyre no get away from me ive had a terrible day so its got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from   yeah thats true im wondering with the boom down here its well not at the moment but a lot of the industrys moving southward   yes are they going to move to uh Mexico   so oh i dont know about that but a lot of the industry up in uh you know the northern states is moving south  and im wondering if thats going to have any effect you know on what you see now were were were behind down here         i say we because i live here if that might not turn around in the next you know fifteen twenty years   yeah maybe the maybe theyll bring their good schools with them  you know if the industry comes   yeah   hopefully theyll promote good schools because i know the town that i come from the the uh the large IBM plant has something to do with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one and plus for for the type of student thats going to that school its going to raise the level of the school   right   because your parents are engineers or chemists theyre theyre youre most likely to do better in school theyre going to help you   you hope   yeah you hope  well i think i i dont know i just think it its its a duty of the parent to do that i mean jeez my parents always helped me and i dont know its just like you say its the way youre raised and the economic situation youre in i can see some lady shes twenty one years old and shes got four kids a kid in her first grader i dont see where shes going to have much time for him  so i dont know its just like   i guess you just have to wonder is it up to the is it you know who whose supposed to make the change the the state the government the federal government you know wheres the money supposed to come from is it   i dont know actually i think it i think it should be a civic level the city level and a a system level really to find out and to to see what they need and not overinflate it   you know what what do you advocate more taxes or better management of what they got   like if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and youre getting raises every eighteen months you got to go hey now wait a minute were in a recession here   yeah   we uh our town didnt pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many many years just because people are are in the recession and theyre even though weve uh enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years now we got eight percent uh unemployment when it used to be four or five people are going whoa   yeah   so   starts hitting closer to home   yeah but i always  see its all its all money this like a couple other topics we had talked about was crime It its its all money based and what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level and and then if youre in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school who knows but maybe we do we need some more Catholic schools support the church instead  they seem to have done a the good job in the past in uh some places uh you couldnt go to a public school it was miles down the road and the only school you could go to was the Baptist school or the Catholic school so   yeah theyre a lot more strict   yeah the i dont   you uh have to learn you arent given the chance to you know screw off all the time     yeah i dont know if i would do that to my child though  but so hum pretty much though see i dont have any good ideas or or anything that would contribute see this isnt a subject that i think a lot about because im never faced with it because our school system in Vermont it seems to do a really good job   well i know im in the you know the only reason i asked about secondary schools or you know advanced education is because down here you know going to the University of Texas the education im getting i think is kind of shoddy for a public school   is it   i i dont think im getting what i should but you know in Texas its next to free because they they pay so much of it its state supported but at the same time its really not its not like going to MIT my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of MIT and thats its really too bad   well that   but thats i dont know i think it just builds on the foundation that theyve already built you get people out of high schools and college junior colleges that dont have the background for an MIT kind of curriculum so   well so you have to go to a lesser engineering school we have a very good public school up here and a degree out there means a lot its a very good school its its University of Vermont um we also have some two year college well theres a four year colleges they all have a pretty good reputation but like you say you
