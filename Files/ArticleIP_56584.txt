michael berube                                       Date Sun Nov            Kudos to Jacob Weisberg for reading Cornel West onhis own instead of relying on Leon Wieseltiers version Wieseltiers essay on the decline of the black intellectual wasnt really the devastatingcritique of Wests work that Weisberg once took it to be and its relativelygood to hear that although Weisberg had hitherto set his lights by it he nolonger agrees with Wieseltiers conclusion that Wests work is almost entirelyworthless            The truth is that Wieseltiers piece was ashameful spiteridden hatchet job on West motivated almost entirely by thefact that West had been profiled in The                New Yorker in  andthen assessed along with lesser lights bell hooks and Michael Dyson by me ina January  essay that likened contemporary black intellectuals to the NewYork intellectuals of the postwar period Robert Boynton in the Feb Atlantic Monthly had pressed the same analogy by reference to SkipGates Shelby Steele and Stanley Crouch and the analogy sent all too manyblack and Jewish intellectuals into frenzies of identity politics andterritorialism Wieseltiers reaction was the worst somewhat akin to hisfrantic illinformed denunciation of the essay by Lionel Trillings son in arecent issue of the American Scholar             Its true that West can be formulaic derivativeclunky and annoyingly selfabsorbed though surely in this last categoryWieseltier is more than a match for him And he really is a mass ofcontradictions But his virtues are considerable nonetheless and as Weisbergwrites suit him well for the role of Bradleys counselor This is much morethan can be said for Wieseltier hence the venom of his essay A tip of thehat then to Mr Weisberg whose work Ive enjoyed often in the past

          A very lucid analysis But Jacob you make fun ofthe Chekhov references without explaining them West has really grappled withthe great plays and found in the lack of a central consciousness theprotagonists are not mouthpieces for the playwright and refusal to demonizeeven the most destructiveseeming characters a hallmark of Christianforgiveness I confess I dont know as much as I should about Christiantheology and Im not sure Chekhov knew all that much either but I do shareWests and many others view of Chekhov as a kind of saint of the dramaalbeit a saint with a rarely acute bullshit
