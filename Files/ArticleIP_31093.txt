areshowing concern Since the Irish Republican Army refuses to decommission itsweapons before representatives of Sinn Fein its political wing are seated inthe new Northern Ireland executive and since the Unionist leader refuses tocall the assembly to order before the IRA gives up at least some of its armsthe current stalemate seems fairly intractable            Irelands SundayBusiness Post                called for the British prime minister to apply hisKosovo spirit to Northern Ireland saying Its time for Blair to assert hisposition and power to effect change demonstrated so clearly in the

reports that after scandals surrounding Olympic venue selections theprocedure was reformed so that International Olympic Committee members areprohibited from visiting potential locations Instead a member selectionpanel narrows the field of possible venues to two final contenders with thefinal selection being made by the IOC For the  games Sion Switzerlandwas the clear favorite of the two finalists offering good venues a strongtradition of winter sports and the political and economic security that theOlympic Games need However according to the Japan Times  thegrandees of the IOC resent being given a fait accompli and voted against therecommendation to remind the world just who makes the final choice Anotherugly motive was anger at the Swiss the paper claims since Swiss IOC
