                    Background        Although the role of the osteoclast in bone resorption        is becoming better understood   much remains to be        learned about osteoclastogenesis and the exact mechanism of        action of antiresorbing agents on the functional        osteoclast The antiresorbing agent estradiol is        especially noteworthy because of the association of its        decline at menopause with the development of postmenopausal        osteoporosis As previously noted by Liu and Howard the        underlying cellular changes responsible the increased bone        formation which follows estrogen administration are still        not well characterized          In the present report we report findings on alterations        in osteoclast morphology following long term administration        of high doses of estradiol to BDF mice Development        of osteosclerosis and the disappearance of the marrow space        in these estrogentreated mice is an interesting and useful        model since marrow stromal cells not only contain the        precursors for osteogenic cell lineages but they also        exert important effects on osteoclastogenesis and        lymphopoiesis and modulate the effects of some systemic        factors of bone turnover Osteoclasts as well as        osteoblasts possess estrogen receptors             Hematopoietic cells also influence osteogenic cell        differentiation and some evidence suggests that mature        lymphocytes influence osteoclast and osteoblast function        In the estrogentreated mouse model used in the studies        reported here natural killer NK cells which rely upon        an intact bone marrow for full marrow maturation are        arrested in a nonlytic state   since marrow space is        lessened due to the osteosclerosis the spleen provides the        source for T and B cells and macrophages        The objective of the present study was to assess the        functional state of osteoclasts in estrogentreated mice by        determining if osteoclasts retained tartrateresistant acid        phosphatase activity TRAP and normal ultrastructural        features                    Results        Radiographic examination of excised specimens from        control and estradioltreated mice confirmed the presence        of osteosclerosis in the femurs of estradioltreated mice        Diaphyseal cortices were prominent in the midshaft of        control specimens Figure Aand C but could not be        identified in specimens from estradioltreated animals        Figure B Dand E These changes were not due to        differences in radiographic technique since control and        estradioltreated femurs shown in Figure were exposed        sidebyside on the same film        Histologic examination also confirmed osteosclerotic        features in femurs from estradioltreated mice Specimens        from estradioltreated mice contained only small regions of        bone marrow Fig B in contrast to control bones Figure        A Since the normal preestradiol treatment endosteal        margin could still be histologically identified on these        specimens specimens were evaluated with quantitative        histomorphometry by first measuring the old normal marrow        area and then measuring the small marrow cavity areas        present at time of harvest On average  of midshaft        marrow space was replaced by bone in estradioltreated mice        at  weeks p   control vs        estradioltreated        Osteoclasts Ocl present in both control and        estradioltreated mice showed positive localization of TRAP        Figure C In contrast to the close apposition of Ocl to        the bone surface seen in control specimens in        estradioltreated animals Ocl extended away from the bone        surface with little bone contact Figure D In order to        further investigate this observation transmission electron        microscopy was performed to examine the fine structure of        the Ocl in estradioltreated and control specimens        Figure Aillustrates the normal ultrastructural        appearance of an Ocl from a control femur note the normal        ruffled border and snug apposition of the Ocl to the bone        surface Ocl from estradioltreated animals however        frequently showed only one margin of the cell perimeter        involved with small areas of ruffed border formation with        the remainder of the cell surface displaying a smooth        profile Fig B Some Ocl from estradioltreated animals        had no ruffled borders in spite of the appearance of some        attempt to form sealing podosome regions Fig C                    Discussion        The present study indicated that severe changes in Ocl        morphology are associated with the cells inability to        carry out resorption in the osteosclerotic        estradioltreated mouse Although osteoclasts retained TRAP        activity ultrastructural alterations were identified in        estradioltreated animals in both the sealing patterns of        osteoclasts against the bone surface and in altered brush        border morphology Proper sealing of the osteoclast against        the bone surface and a functional brush border are two        ultrastructural components believed to be of major        importance in Ocl function The ultrastructural alterations        identified in estrogentreated mice were very likely the        cellular functional basis for the decreased resorption and        development of osteosclerosis in estrogentreated mice        Osteoclast function and ultrastructural morphology have        been shown to be highly responsive to antiresorbing agents        such as ethanehydroxydiphosphonate EHDP           dichloromethylene diphosphanate Cl          MDP   calcitonin            other antiresorptive agents such as mithramycin          and to gallium nitrate          Although histochemical TRAP localization provides an        accurate and sensitive histologic method for identification        of Ocl understanding osteoclastogenesis and Ocl function        remain a challenging area of bone research The current        understanding of Ocl function is that the Ocl seals its        perimeter along the bone surface by means of the podosome             Within this sealed margin projections from        the cytoplasm form the ruffled border a specialized        Oclextracellular space in which bone resorption occurs In        the present study in the mouse differentiation of        osteoclast progenitors appears to be dependent on the        direct interaction of bone marrow stromal cells with Ocl        precursor cells    Recent data of Baylink   and        Linkhart   provide evidence that two inbred strains of        mice with different bone densities may have fundamental        differences in bone resorption not bone formation and        that genes affecting the bone marrow Ocl precursor        population may contribute to relative differences in the        CBLJ and CHHeJ strains In vivo and in vitro studies        of avian osteoclasts led Pederson et al to suggest that        modulation of the Ocl response to estrogen may be        controlled by alterations in the Ocl estrogen receptor        level          Maturation of osteoclasts from their macrophage        precursors requires marrow stromal cells or their        osteoblast progeny as shown by Udagawa et al   These        cells produce macrophage colonystimulating factor MCSF        and the receptor for activation of nuclear factor kappa b        NF         k B RANK ligand RANKL MCSF is        essential for macrophage maturation but formation of        osteoclasts also requires contact between osteoclast        precursors and stromal cells or osteoblasts   As        described by Hofbauer et al   the quantity of bone        resorbed depends on the balance between expression of RANKL        and of its inhibitor osteoprotegerin OPG Hofbauer et al        suggest that the stimulation of the pool of MCSF        precursors to committed osteoclastogenesis by RANKL may be        one of the central pathophysiologic pathways involved in        increasing the number of osteoclasts in osteoporosis        Futures studies of the estrogentreated mouse model are        needed which are designed to address osteoclastogenesis and        osteoprotegerin OPG secretion by osteoblasts OPG is        currently hypothesized to be an important paracrine        mediator of the antiresorptive action of estrogen on bone        cells   In osteoblast cell lines exposed to estrogen        OPG mRNA and protein levels were increased compared to        controls Hofbauer et al have suggested that estrogen may        exert its antiresorptive effects by enhancement of OPG        secretion by osteoblasts          Future studies should also assess the temporal        development of functional changes in the osteoclast        populations during estrogen treatment and the patterns of        osteoclast death with special attention to apoptosis        Estradiol has been shown to modulate IL action on human        osteoclasts in vitro estrogen administration inhibited        ILmediated cytokine IL mRNA induction and caused        increased Ocl apoptosis   When avian Ocl were exposed        to estradiol in vitro the Ocl plasma membrane became        depolarized and there was a marked decrease in potential        suggesting that estrogen may regulate osteoclasts through        ion channel activities   Estradiol has also been shown        to inhibit acid production in avian Ocl   The human        preOcl cell line FLG  has specific binding sites to        estradiol on the cell surface and estradiol exposure        increases the cellular pH cAMP cGMP and intracellular        calcium          In vivo work by Jilka et al has shown that Il can        prevent the bone loss associated with ovariectomy in the        mouse model   Girasole et al have recently shown that        production of IL is inhibited in vitro by exposure of        marrow cells to estradiol cultures of mouse bone cells        showed suppressed osteoclast development when exposed to        either estradiol or a neutralizing antibody to Il          Future in vivo studies combining estradiol and        selected interleukins may further elucidate how the network        of signals from the marrow microenvironment influences both        Ocl development and Ocl function                    Conclusions        Findings extend our understanding of osteoclast        structure and function in the mouse exposed in vivo to high        doses of estrogen Ultrastructural examination showed that        osteoclasts from estrogentreated mice were unable to seal        against the bone surface and were unable to form ruffled        borders                    Materials and Methods        BDF mice were selected for this study based upon the        following criteria The CBL mouse is positive for the        NK  epitope but from previous unpublished data we found        that the CBL responded poorly to estradiol From        previous hybrid resistance studies we had historical data        that the BDF mouse would be positive for the NK         epitope and respond well to the estradiol BDF male mice        aged  weeks were implanted for at least  weeks with        silastic tubing filled with  mg estradiol             agematched controls received empty tubing NK        cytolytic functions disappeared in estradioltreated mice        by  weeks Previous work with the model by Roubinian et al        showed that administration of  mg estradiol by this        method returned estrogen levels to normal in ovariectomized        mice for more than  months   Seaman et al has also        reported that administration  mg estradiol in this model        was capable of raising estradiol to  times the normal        level           At  weeks postimplantation euthanasia was        performed CO          inhalation and femurs were harvested        from  control and  estradioltreated mice        Crosssections of the femur and sections of femoral        metaphyses and epiphyses were studied For light        microscopy specimens were either fixed in  neutral        buffered formalin decalcified and embedded in paraffin or        processed nondecalcified and embedded in methyl        methacrylate For ultrastructural studies specimens were        fixed in Karnovskys fixative postfixed in osmium        tetroxide decalcified and embedded in Spurr resin Thin        sections were prepared and grids were stained with uranyl        acetate and lead citrate Sections were viewed on a        Phillips CM transmission electron microscope Light        microscopic sections were evaluated with quantitative        histomorphometry using OsteoMeasure software OsteoMetrics        Inc Decatur GA Tartrateresistant acid phosphatase        TRAP localization was performed to identify osteoclasts        with light microscopy Protocols were approved by the        appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use        Committee        Statistical analysis of quantitative histomorphometric        data used standard statistical methods means and standard        deviations were calculated Unpaired ttests were used to        test for differences between means a pvalue of         was considered statistically significant
