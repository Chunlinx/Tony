                 um well you know i i think it it really depends you know i think you know if if you know taking the current batch weve got you know i think Paul Tsongas probably isnt in it for like his own gain i i dont see him as that kind of a guy i can believe like that Bill Clinton might be um i certainly think a lot of people in Congress are   well its for me its hard to talk about uh specifics because i dont know the people all ive read is uh the headlines the uh   umhum   the generic question which is what theyre talking about i think its   yeah   all government any government is based on the honesty of the of the individual right   yeah well you know i think i think if you like compare us to other governments you know i i think we tend to be overly critical of our own government i mean you go and look like a lot of these African countries where corruption is right right out in the open its like you know you want to do something you know you better even be the presidents best friend or you know pay me a lot of money   yeah well thats thats part of it the tradition certainly modifies it if you have uh tradition of of um like   baksheesh or whatever they call it   yeah or might makes right or money and which is might   right or bucks make right   so uh in certainly youre not going to have the same kind of honesty on the other hand uh i i i think it seems to me that all the big scandals are based on either individual honesty uh going corrupt or frankly uh uh elective honesty going bad on us   well you know i i think you know to some extent you know people get the government they deserve is a cliche   yeah   but it its really true i mean if you know you hear these guy i think that this is the first election ive heard about where a lot of the incumbents are really finding saying okay were getting out because its too much heat i mean normally its yeah okay what big scandal but it comes times to reelect them they say hey this is the guy that brings home the bacon for us you know hes got seniority on all these committees were not gonna replace him   yes and thats again the what you said earlier about people get what they deserve they say well if if if a dishonest person is uh good for us well keep him in office   yeah and i mean also you know you look i think a lot of it has to do with reform with with with the issue of campaign reform when it costs you i mean ten million twenty million dollars sometimes ive heard horrendous figures to run for a Senate seat you know  job pays a hundred thousand a year you know it it it the you work it out unless someone is incredibly altruistic you know theres no reason for them to want to run for that   i i think that uh part of it again is this this uh   well organizations can go bad and our particular organization has is one of the best in the world but its still relative to itself is uh is in serious need of reform um ive ive been overseas and and theres a lot of as you pointed out theres a lot of corruption corruption in other countries and so when you come back to the States you say well as bad as this is im still awfully glad to be here uh so i guess the you know this this question was can we ever get uh totally uh honest government and i would say uh   right its an imperfect system because people are imperfect   yeah only to the extent that im honest can i can i uh uh act as an honest person   i i mean the problem is that    you know youve got as i said theres no incentive incentive to go into  i mean look at our state legislature and things where very nominal pay but theres also not you know whats the campaign the campaign is four guys go against each other and you know theres no advertising those people i can believe are doing it because they want to change the process but when youre talking about having to spend tens of millions of dollars to get elected and then being in the pockets of all these people who gave you the money and then having to regard how to repay you know how to uh kind of do for yourself i think i i really think that its not so much that corrupt people go into it as that the process corrupts   i i i would agree with you there well the other side of the coin too is that that the whole that the process even from the beginning uh you scratch my back ill scratch yours uh i would even i would disagree with you a little bit because i think in the state level thats just part of the uh the internship so to speak and theres a lot of corruption   i i think it depends a lot on on the state i think that it varies from state to state   oh yes but but what i meant was why do people go why do people run for the school board because thats step one on the ladder     oh oh man i dont want to talk about the school board weve just weve just been having school board meetings and it was like people suing each over over things they said
