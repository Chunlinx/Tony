DearPrudie                                                      I received the worst version of the dreadedChristmas letteraddressed to no one in particularwith an early Christmascard The computerized letter began with the rundown of every family membersaccomplishments for the last year Included in the accomplishments werebeing fired from a job suing someone for discrimination three neardeathexperiences and an extended hospital stay Having spilled their collectiveguts all over the page the writing family then began a paragraph thatominously began We dont know how to begin this next paragraph  Whatfollowed was breathtaking in its bad manners They went from thirdpartynarrative to firstperson accusatory stating that their youngest son insertname here had been married in May and they spent A LOT OF TIME making sureYOU were invited to the wedding and that YOU had not cared enough to attendsend a present OR EVEN SEND A  CARD Finally they say they want to knowWHY                                       Yes I was one ofthe boorish many who didnt attend their sons wedding or send a gift or evena  card since I had met the son only once when he was  Do I owe my friendan apology and her son a card                                       To Ignore or Not To Ignore                        Dear To            How about ignore tillthe end of time Of all the tacky cloddish judgmental communications Prudiecould imagine this one is right up there Prudie doesnt care for theseChristmas letters to begin with finding them most often little packages ofbraggadocio and bathos They are extremely difficult to do well and the bottomline is that nobody really gives a rats patooty whether the writer has had aneardeath experience or a promotion In this particular case Prudie hopesyour friend does not get Dutch elm disease            Prudie immovably                                             Prudence                                                      Im married to MrAngry at the World He isnt always this way When were with friends hegenerally covers it well but with family his anger is obvious So obvious thatour children refuse to go places with him because his temper is always flaringHolidays with him are a nightmare He makes everyone nervous and no one has agood time He whines and yells at the kids for laughing or playing too loud Myyearoldson suggested that we just get Dad a motel room for the holidays andlet him deal with room service Im considering itbeing so tired of dealingwith his tantrums and childish attitudes His family doesnt celebrateholidays and he feels that my family traditions are impossibly overdone Ifeel however that children need holiday celebrations and I like thetraditions feeling they give meaning to life My question Since he seems tohate holidays so much would it be appropriate to just let him spend holidaysat a motel I keep thinking that maybe if he saw what holidays would be likewithout us he would realize what hes missing Please help me                                       What To Do                        Dear What            Your grinch sounds likeScrooge with a mood disorder If he goes bananas because the kids are laughingtoo loud and your yearold is suggesting shipping him off you have areal problem one for which Prudie doubts that parking Dad at a Holiday Inn isthe answer The fact that his family didnt celebrate and yours did may havesomething to do with it Your whining yelling spouse may be whining andyelling for help Try to get him to see a mental health professional using theargument that his behavior goes way beyond not being in a celebratory moodChristmas with a roomservice waiter is not a solution            Prudie encouragingly                                             Prudie                                                      As a former storemanager and a shopper may I add a small PS to the store manager who wrotelast week about  in the supermarket I had a lady who would feed her childall the way through the store When it was brought to my attention on her nextvisit I met her at the door and told her we wanted to weigh her son  andthen we would weigh him again on checkout That was the last time she ever fedhim while shopping though she continued to shop at our store for many yearsSometimes all it takes to put a stop to it is to let the grazer know that youknow                                       bf                        Dear b            You must have worked atsome wonderful store to have embarrassed the lady like that and still kept heras a customer That was a very creative solution but risky she might aseasily have asked if you were a pediatrician and then stomped out A few thingswe do know from the original letter however Eating from supermarket shelvesis stealingan act all consumers pay forand openaccess bins may not bepristine            Prudie informationally                                             Dear Prudence                                                      All I ever thinkabout is sex All I ever look at on the Internet is sexual stuff                                       In Trouble or Not                        Dear In            If youre a teenage boy your preoccupation wouldbe pretty normal Actually a lot of people think about sex a lot of the timeNow that theyve lifted censorship in the Soviet Union for example its agood guess theyre not reading Solzhenitsyn online This is not a moral issueper se Its OK to feel sexyor to be interested in erotica though much ofwhats on the Net hardly qualifies as erotic            If what you are reallyconcerned about is that your sex drive and interest are unmanageablethat isdominating your mental life your compulsive interest may in fact be aboutsomething else  anger perhaps or feelings of inadequacy It may be anavoidance mechanism Because you are concerned and Prudie is not apsychiatrist why not see a professional to find out whats what Insuranceoften pays cognitivebehaviorist therapists You might perhaps wind up withProzac considered a notorious cold shower Moderation is what youre aimingfor and consider it a plus that you know your interest may be excessive            Prudie pharmaceutically
