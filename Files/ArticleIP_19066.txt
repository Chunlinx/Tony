by grownups without apparent irony within the past hourI guess its gone the route of coolrevived as quaint and retro by younguns and gradually deironized I assume the term originated as a s or ship allusion to the LP record But maybe not                        Well close Briefly the word dates back to jazz circlesin the s and ultimately derives from the phrase in the groove meaningperforming or doing exceptionally well What the groove in that phraseoriginally referred to is hard to establish definitively because severalmeanings current in the s all permit plausible theories Many dictionariesdo link the groove of in the groove to the groove of a recordBut groove could also refer to the path between a pitcher and the strikezone and had done so since the turn of the century a pitcher who wasthrowing in the groove was throwing very well Groove also had avulgar sexual connotation which could likewise give in the groove theconnotation of high performance and pleasure And groove could simplymean a style a sense associated with the parallel between being in agroove and being in a rut  In the  th centurygroovy actually meant to be in a rut or to be of settled habits

usually was I suspect that the word has long existedin a netherworld between interjectional utility and outright puton Perhaps aningenuous minority used it innocently in its hippie heyday but most often oneheard it uttered with a bit of wonderment as if the speaker couldnt believethat he or she was really using the word            Groovy continues to thrive with the same sort ofambivalence
