        your turn     okay uh i dont think they should abolish it i think its i think if they put it into force more often they wouldnt have as many problems as theyve got   but not for petty theft   right no no for major things like premeditated murder mass murders uh you know that type of thing i dont think it should just be used loosely     well it should be used as a deterrent do you think   yeah well   or should it be used uh as to prevent further uh crime like   yes yeah prevent these people from ever getting out on the streets by you know some technicality and they go down the line ten years and then on some little technicality they get out and theyre on the streets again doing the same they they did before   hm umhum   and you know you know thats about the only thing and like for petty for theft and and stuff like that or manslaughter you know i dont think they should do that   well you know theres this old um Jewish is it saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth   oh well well i guess if i if it was someone in my family id probably feel that way you know ive never had anybody in my immediate family uh murdered and so i really wouldnt know but but i feel like if i did i probably would feel that way   uh one of the things i was thinking about is uh you know from societys point of view if you put a value on each person what you want to do is to maximize the end game value so if you have someone that that destroys that value   umhum   uh then what you want to take steps to uh minimize the loss of course you have to also put value on the criminal   right   so if you terminate him thats a loss of value so you know if you weight everyone equally   well thats true   then you have to say well the likelihood of not terminating him if if you dont terminate him the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person in other words youd have to youd have to murder more than one other person   besides him   uh in order to justify taking his life   okay   another way you could do it is weight this value by uh the value to society of the people uh which is pretty uh delicate thing to do but one way of doing it is uh by income so  if this guy doesnt make a great deal of money which is often times the case then     his life isnt worth very much then   then hes obviously not worth very much and so uh the likelihood that you know maybe expected expected murders by him is is um integrated over the income of the people uh that he murders is maybe you know a loss of who knows eight hundred thousand dollars uh but if he only uh integrated you know integrated income over the expected expected remainder of his life is um small less than eight hundred thousand dollars then you terminate him of course one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm is you find that its more easy its easier to uh to uh uh terminate older people than younger people since the uh uh integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less   right   which means well i suppose you could say well that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation   potential i mean thats the thats the key right there potential   umhum   now are they are they rehabilitative or or not huh   now thats all fine and well and and uh good philosophically but if youre involved yourself personally   umhum   uh i know i have a friend whose uh son was murdered on on the night before his sixteenth birthday and let me tell you uh i i knew them personally uh not intimately but quite well and uh   umhum   youre talking about real trauma i mean trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies   i can imagine   uh the father you know of of course um a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get i think in terms of psychological impact   yes yeah   um     was he murdered did they find out who killed him   and oh yes they found him and he is on trial for capital murder   hm so it hasnt been a long time ago just recently   uh well actually he im im sorry he uh was convicted uh and of course now you know and you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process but     yeah yeah that appeals process i mean its what you know really you know just drags out and out and out my brotherinlaw here in Texas his by marriage my sisters husband husband his sister was murdered down here by a guy in in well actually in Houston and uh he would
