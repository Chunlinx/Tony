                                 Brandis Bra                           Whats theGoal                        Normally I find William Saletan to be one of themore intelligent journalists on the mainstream beat However his analysis of the controversy surrounding Brandi Chastains removal of her jersey afterclinching the World Cup trophy is indulgent quixotic and utterlyaggravating            He dismisses the men do it explanation assuperficial when its the only one that makes any real sense Does anyone oneither side of this absurd debate really believe that an athlete upon scoringthe winning goal in an international championship game was actually trying tostage some kind of cultural coup With adrenaline pumping in the moment ofrealizing the dream of being a hero with memories of the soccer greats runningthrough her head she did what soccer players do when they cant containthemselves Are the pundits of the world so conceited that they really believethat she was acting to supply them with more fodder            I think it was the game against North Korea whenin celebration of a goal one of the players did a running flipflopflip acommon soccerplayers celebration The announcer called it gymnasticsApparently to him the only sports against which women would be measured weregymnastics and figure skating Regardless of which side of the sports bradebate Saletan supports or anyone else who considers Chastains behavior inlight of its social commentary rather than its expression of athleticcompetition and pride its the same kind of sexism            Soccer in America forthe moment is a womans sport That means that the culture of soccer with allits grace and skill brutality and bravado will be exhibited by femaleAmerican athletes It makes me wonder what people would be saying if womensbaseball became popular and the commentariat was forced to watch women chewingtobacco and grabbing their crotches             Chad Levinson                        NewYork                           Dont DevaluateNow                        Paul Krugman has been for a long time a verycritical observer of Argentinas currency board he has suggested a devaluationmany times in the past Almost at the end of his article  he says thatgiven that the Brazilian devaluation didnt bring hyperinflation it could beexpected that an Argentinian devaluation wouldnt bring hyperinflation Heconcludes that from the fact that the two countries have dismal economichistories but dismal doesnt mean the same On the surface both countriesmight look quite alike but peoples reaction to inflation and economicmeasures has proved to be very different so we shouldnt expect to see bothcountries reacting the same way            I deeply admire Krugman but if he wants to writeabout Argentina or any Latin American country he should dedicate some time totrying to understand what each country is like They all might look the samebut they are different people are very different and react in different waysHistorically what has been good for Chile Argentinas neighbor has been adisaster for Argentina and this works the other way around If he haddedicated time to studying Argentina he would have found out that EduardoDuhalde is desperately trying to gain votes relying on old clichs that heexpects will still be appealing to Argentinians and trying to show howdifferent he is from Carlos Menemin part because he is different and in partto avoid the opposition attack Krugman would also have found out that theBuenos Aires Stock Exchange is not representative of the way things are Bondsare important and what businessmen are doing is important            I agree that we have aregular recession and that the currency board prevents us from applying theusual recipe but its not clear that it would work and at this point breakingthe peso commitment would be extremely onerous Right now we have a recessionand an increasing fiscal deficit a comment on the virtues of keeping balancedaccounts would be very appropriate if we devaluate chances are we would alsohave an inflation outburst a rush against the banking system and a capitalflight When analyzing Argentina its important to keep in mind that sinceweve been cheated many times we have learned how to beat the system             Mara LauraSegura                        BuenosAires Argentina                                             Paul Krugman replies                               I was of course aware of the politicsthat led to Duhaldes remark And in case this wasnt clear the article didNOT claim that Argentinas currency board is necessarily a foolish ideaonlythat its downside could not be ignored But I will say this One should alwaysbe suspicious of arguments that claim that one country is utterly differentfrom others Yes every country is uniquebut not all that unique Anywayonly a few months ago many peopleincluding Argentine economistswereclaiming that the contrast between Argentine success and Brazilian crisis meantthat Brazil must emulate Argentinas currency board you cant take thatposition and then claim that the role reversal that has taken place sincedoesnt teach a contrary lesson                                       Pilot Error                        I agree with James Fallows warning  toinexperienced pilots who may know how to fly under good weather conditions butwho havent much under the belt on a hazy night We all mourn the death of JohnF Kennedy Jr but at the same time I will go beyond Fallows opinion and saythat Kennedys decision to fly on a hazy night in a new oneengine plane overwater is not riskyits down right reckless  I have two daughters andif I knew that my two daughters were going up in a oneengine plane with ahusband who lacked sufficient experience on a hazy night over the sea Id doeverything in my power to prevent it from happening If the pilot wants to takethat chance alone fine but once he allows passengers he has to beresponsible enough to make the right decision for not only himself but forthose two girls as well            My daughters safety isthe primary concern Unfortunately John Kennedy wasted his own life and thelives of two young and beautiful girls without thinking This isnt worththe risk  when he knew it could be dangerous under such conditions             Sandy Shapiro                        Woodside Calif                           Governer Bush inDeed                        Regarding  I have been in the title insurancebusiness for  years and prior to that did my masters thesis on the field atWharton            It is not true that a person must include a priorset of restrictions in a deed when he sells his property He may simply refuseto include them It is up to the buyerand the buyers title companytodiscover them in the chain of title and to determine if they have any legalforce or effect            Bush did not have to do anything except direct thatthe restrictions be omitted or stricken from the deed he granted to his buyerThe only circumstance in which he would need to seek the consent of otherlandowners in the development would be if he wanted to petition to change therestrictions or permit an exception to them            As a lawyer Bush should have been fully aware ofthe language in this instrument which both he and his wife had to sign and ofhis legal prerogatives As the governor of his state he should have had thedecency fortitude and sensitivity to recognize the importance of refusing toinclude these restrictions in his deed            Incidentally inPennsylvania the presence of a racial restriction in a set of deedrestrictions makes all the rest of that set of restrictions eg as to themaximum height of fences the prohibition of nonsinglefamily residences etcnull and void This was a result of a case involving the will of Steven Girardand Girard College in Philadelphia that went to the US Supreme Court in thes and resulted in a landmark decision             Robert CDean                        Lancaster Penn
