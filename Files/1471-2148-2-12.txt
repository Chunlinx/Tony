                    Background                  The experimental system          The design of the evolution experiment has been          described elsewhere     In short  lines were          derived from a single strictly asexual clone of           E coli B that has been in the          laboratory for several decades see          httpmyxocssmsueduecolistrainsourcehtmlfor more          information The strain is prototrophic it can          synthesize all components of a cell from a single energy          source such as glucose and inorganic salts nitrogen          etc and has undoubtedly undergone some general          adaptation to the laboratory environment but has not          been selected under any specific conditions like the          evolution protocol prolonged serial transfer in minimal          medium A spontaneous mutant of the ancestor capable of          using arabinose Ara  was used to found six of the          replicates whereas the other six were founded with the          Ara ancestor This trait can be used to distinguish          between populations on indicator plates and is neutral in          the selective environment     The populations are          maintained by the daily transfer of  ml of culture          into  ml of fresh Davis minimal media supplemented          with  gml of glucose DM These conditions allow          roughly    cellsml at stationary phase Every           generations  days samples of each population were          stored in a glycerol suspension at C          The bacterial populations that are the focus of this          study have been well studied                     A brief review of the relevant observations follows          First each of these lines has adapted to growth in a          serially diluted or seasonal environment of          glucoselimited minimal media        The          dynamics of adaptation are well known after a period of          rapid adaptation during the first  generations the          rate of improvement has subsequently slowed to almost          onethirtieth of the initial rate      Moreover          relatively few mutations generated this early rapid          adaptation       Thus these populations have          experienced two types of dynamics one of rapid          adaptation followed by one of much slower improvement          Nonetheless this gradual adaptation contributed          significantly to the mean fitness relative to the          ancestor of  by generation               Travisano and Lenski     demonstrated that          adaptations specific to growth on glucose were partly          responsible for the initial fitness improvements They          found that evolved populations tended to outcompete the          ancestor on substrates that share membrane transport          pathways with glucose but were inferior on substrates          that did not To assess the longerterm consequences of          these adaptations Cooper and Lenski    employed          Biolog plates which are microtiter plates containing           different carbon sources and an indicator dye that          reflects the amount of respiration on each substrate          Sampling three clones per population after generations            and  the authors found that average          performance on the  informative foreign substrates          decayed significantly over time The primary objective of          this study was to deduce which of two population genetic          mechanisms antagonistic pleiotropy and mutation          accumulation was more responsible for specialization          results were strongly in favor of antagonistic          pleiotropy However this experiment also approximated          the evolution of one aspect of the           fundamental niche  diet breadth          in these populations          Cooper et al    continued this line of research          by studying the evolution of thermal niche in these          populations which are maintained at a constant C          Maximum growth rate which has been shown to be the          primary determinant of fitness in this system              was measured across a range of temperatures C          over evolutionary time The authors found a surprising          amount of correlated adaptation to moderate          temperatures surrounding C suggesting that selection          at this temperature had favored mutations that also          improved performance at presumably physiologically          similar temperatures However mean performance at          extreme temperatures C C decreased over          evolutionary time with several evolved clones failing to          grow at these temperatures Judging the effect of this          laboratory evolution on the thermal niche of these          bacterial populations therefore depends on ones          perspective Mean growth at extreme temperatures tended          to decrease but mean growth rates across a range of          moderate temperatures actually increased over time          In summary the functionality of these evolved           E coli populations under certain          conditions has been compromised by longterm adaptation          to a singleresource singletemperature environment Yet          most of these experiments have approximated the          fundamental niche by examining each clone in isolation          from its ancestor and other members of the population By          comparison measuring the realized niche requires a          headtohead test of fitness with the ancestor After a          survey of diet breadth using Biolog plates this study          focuses on a series of direct competitions between          evolved isolates from  generations and the ancestor          in four foreign environments Assays of individual          functions and wholeorganism fitness are clearly quite          different but it is the latter poorly measured property          that ultimately determines both evolutionary success and          the tangible dimensions of the niche                          Experimental design          These experiments focus only on isolates from the          populations at  generations and their common          ancestors Three clones from each population were picked          randomly from platings of these cultures and frozen          separately each experiment therefore compares  clones           populations   clones with the two ancestors Ara          and Ara  I studied multiple clones from each          population because there are withinpopulation          polymorphisms that may be associated with functional          differences                 The environments are described as follows First I          both increased and decreased the concentration of glucose           gml of glucose is standard in the evolutionary          medium in order to test the specificity of adaptation to          the environment I hypothesized that adaptation to a          particular concentration of glucose in the medium might          reduce competitive ability at either lower  gml or          higher  gml concentrations perhaps because of          tradeoffs between resource affinity and maximum growth          rate Next I added bile salts which are organic          detergents that are lethal to most nonenteric bacteria          to the standard experimental medium Tolerance to bile          salts is a characteristic that has been used to define          enteric bacteria over the years which is shared by the          ancestor in this experiment In           E coli  it has been established          that bile acids may traverse the outer membrane through          the OmpF porin which is the same porin through which          glucose passes     If selection for improved glucose          transport resulted in a greater number of OmpF porins          relative to the more bileresistant smallerchannel OmpC          porin      for example it is possible that          tolerance to bile salts was compromised as the          populations evolved As a second test of the effect of          selection on the outer membrane I measured the          resistance to the antibiotic novobiocin of each          population While novobiocin acts primarily as a DNA          gyrase inhibitor resistance is mediated by the          concentration of phospholipids in the outer membrane for          which the           cls gene encoding cardiolipin          synthase is partly responsible     Again if          selection had increased membrane permeability          sensitivity to novobiocin might have increased relative          to the partially resistant ancestor          I chose the LB Luria broth environment because its          nutrients are so different from the selection medium but          other conditions remain the same eg culture vessel          temperature and serial transfer regime LB media          consists of tryptone yeast extract which is the          watersoluble portion of autolyzed yeast and salt In          short it is a complex of nutrients largely devoid of          simple carbohydrates like glucose The LB environment was          diluted with distilled water to generate comparable cell          density with the standard selective environment For each          competition in a foreign environment fitness was also          simultaneously measured in the standard medium for a          direct reference                            Results                  Diet breadth narrows          Consistent with a previous study     I found a          significant decline in diet breadth of an average of           for all evolved populations Figure  one sampled          ttest t   df   p   This decline in          diet breadth proved to be general and not limited to a          few substrates on average evolved populations tended to          perform worse than the ancestor There was no significant          variation among populations in the sum of all catabolic          functions but there was significant variation among          clones within populations Table  A single          specialist clone in population A that grew less than           as well as the ancestor on  of  substrates caused          much of this effect but this clone was otherwise normal          on glucose Another specialist clone that was          abnormally deficient on fewer substrates was also found          in population A These clones were not better or worse          competitors than other clones in the evolution          environment because of their reduced functionality          however data not shown If these two outlying clones          are omitted from the nested ANOVA of diet breadth then          significant variation exists among populations F               p   but no longer          among clones within populations F              p                            Fitness improved in foreign environments          I evaluated diet breadth in a second contrasting          manner by competing clones from evolved populations          directly against the ancestor in four foreign          environments In the first experiment I measured          competitive fitness versus the ancestor over a fold          range of glucose concentrations in the otherwise standard          experimental environment Clones were competed in two          test environments DM and DM as well as in the          control environment DM I found a significant effect          of glucose concentration on population mean fitness          Table  Populations and clones within populations          also varied significantly in their performances at          different glucose concentrations as evidenced by the          significant interaction terms in the ANOVA in Table           Not surprisingly populations were most fit in the DM          environment in which they evolved Figure  ttests for          paired comparisons DM vs DM t           s   df   p   DM          vs DM t           s   df   p            However all populations were more fit than the ancestor          in both DM and DM that is adaptation to the DM          environment brought about correlated improvements in          fitness rather than tradeoffs at other glucose          concentrations Figure  In addition populations were          uniformly more fit in the DM environment than in the          DM environment paired ttest t           s   df   p            In the second experiment I evaluated the effect of          adding bile salts to the experimental medium Figure           The evolved populations performed nearly equivalently          with or without bile salts relative to the ancestor          tailed paired t           s   df   p   A nested          ANOVA on the fitness data in DM  bile salts did reveal          marginally significant variation among and within          populations Table  A single clone from population A          caused nearly all of this variation within populations          this same clone was also deficient on numerous carbon          sources on Biolog plates When I omitted this clone from          the nested ANOVA there was more significant variation          among populations for fitness in bile salts F              p   but not among          clones within populations F              p            In the final experiment I altered the competitive          environment in a more pronounced manner by using a much          more complex medium LB instead of minimal salts          supplemented with glucose I anticipated the greatest          difference in fitness between this environment and the          control Indeed mean fitness in LB was significantly          lower than that in the control environment paired          ttest t           s   df   p            However it was surprising that nine of  populations          had nevertheless increased in fitness in LB relative to          the ancestor and that the fitness of one population          A was statistically indistinguishable when grown in          LB or DM Figure  On the other hand three          populations were statistically equivalent to the ancestor          in LB fitness ie the  confidence intervals of these          means not shown did not exclude the ancestral fitness          which equals  In addition a nested ANOVA using          fitness in LB revealed highly significant variation among          populations but not within populations Table                           Most populations become sensitive to          novobiocin          Assays that examined the ability of each population to          grow on agar plates containing novobiocin demonstrated          that most populations became sensitive to this antibiotic          not shown Nine of  populations were completely          sensitive to the antibiotic no colonies were observed          for any of the three clones tested per population Only          one of the  populations Ara retained a level of          resistance comparable to that of the ancestor and two          other populations Ara and Ara were intermediately          sensitive                            Discussion        Spiegelman and collaborators     asked        bacteriophage Q only to go forth and replicate in the        medium containing Q replicase and numerous functions were        lost We have issued a similar injunction to these         E coli populations except in a        glucose and minimal salts medium Following this precedent        these longterm evolving         E coli populations should have        become streamlined glucose scavengers and evolved a        substantially reduced niche This was not the case at        least not nearly to the extent observed in Q Only one        absolute catabolic loss Dribose    was observed in        all twelve lineages and one additional function        resistance to novobiocin was lost in most populations        These populations performed no worse on average than the        ancestor in most functions assayed and the significant        losses that were found tended to be small in absolute        magnitude not shown see also            Nonetheless the fundamental niche approximated by        Biolog plates declined by an average of  and no        systematic gains in function occurred that might have        compensated for other losses of function In these        populations specialization did not involve numerous        wholesale losses of function but rather reduced        performance on many substrates not used during the        evolution experiment The degree of decay varied both among        and within populations for growth on different substrates        Table  and a substantial amount of functional decay        occurred in two of the  clones sampled Thus the        fundamental catabolic niche of these populations became        narrower while adapting to this simple laboratory        environment        However I arrived at a strikingly different conclusion        when I measured the relative fitness which is analogous to        the realized niche of the evolved populations in four        different foreign environments In these assays        performance was quantified by directly competing the        evolved genotypes with the ancestors and in nearly every        case the evolved genotype was the superior competitor        These correlated improvements in fitness in novel        environments suggest that adaptation to the laboratory        environment was nonspecific and multifaceted and seem to        downplay the significance of the compromised fundamental        niche        Each of these novel environments was not entirely        foreign to the evolved populations however Though glucose        concentration was both raised and lowered tenfold        conditions remained otherwise identical to those of the        evolution experiment These populations were clearly        superior at the lower concentration which in hindsight        likely results from their familiarity with this glucose        level Because glucose concentration in the experimental        medium drops below  gml as the population grows        competitive ability at lower concentrations was likely        favored even if only briefly     Yet the mechanism        behind the greater fitness gains in  gml than in         gml glucose need not be the glucose concentration itself        Vasi et al    argued that selection in these lines for        improved resource affinity at low concentrations was weak        which perhaps implicates some other factor in the medium        oxygen concentration different concentrations of        metabolic byproducts toxicity of increased nutrients        etc as the cause of the lesser fitness gains in  gml        glucose        Bile salts are an important component of the natural        environment of         E coli  so much so that resistance        to these compounds is often used to define enteric bacteria        in microbiological assays Bile salts are like novobiocin        in that both are antibiotics that interact with the outer        membrane but their mechanisms of interaction and their        effects on these populations are rather different Most        populations completely lost the ability to grow in the        presence of novobiocin which suggests an increase in        membrane permeability     However no significant        differences in fitness were found when bile salts were        added to the selective medium indicating that the        mechanisms of increased outer membrane permeability were        not detrimental to bile resistance This may reflect an        ability of         E coli to actively export bile salts        that was unaffected by this experiment     Thus if        changes in membrane permeability perhaps through modified        expression of genes like         cls     were responsible for the        loss of novobiocin resistance they apparently had specific        effects that did not compromise other membrane traits like        tolerance to bile salts Experiments are underway to        establish the mechanism that links adaptation increased        membrane permeability and increased novobiocin        sensitivity        I found no systematic cost of adaptation to the simple        laboratory environment when I modified the glucose        concentration or added bile salts but rather found        correlated improvements in fitness that were sometimes        nearly equivalent to the direct adaptation The simple        explanation is that each of these environments differed by        only one factor from the minimal medium in which the        populations have evolved However the complex LB        environment is certainly different enough from minimal        glucose medium that any improvements in fitness in the LB        environment are surprising One interpretation of all of        the correlated adaptations in novel environments is that        natural selection favored beneficial mutations that are        unaffected by the nutrient medium itself Whereas I altered        the carbon source and media composition I did not change        other conditions like the speed of shaking aeration        temperature or the batch culture protocol Perhaps more        significantly the populations remained sheltered from the        potential onslaught of competing bacteria and predatory        viruses which could conceivably drastically alter their        performance It is likely that the  populations have        adapted in part to several of components of the        feastandfamine minimal laboratory environment and        changing only one of them may not affect the superiority of        other genetic adaptations Thus detecting adaptive decay        may require more dramatic modifications to the        environment        Evidently these evolving populations by acquiring        mutations that were beneficial under several environmental        conditions expanded the niche they could potentially        realize More specifically mutations that improved fitness        in  gml glucose may have also improved fitness in         gml glucose because of the common resource as well as        in dilute LB because of the equivalent cell density        allowed by the medium The same genotypes examined here        were also tested in undiluted LB which is a medium that is        roughly fold more concentrated More losses of fitness        were found which suggests some specialization based on        resource concentration but replicates of the same genotype        were too inconsistent to be considered reliable VS        Cooper unpublished data In general these competitions        in novel environments suggest that mutations that were        beneficial in the selective environment may sometimes have        positive pleiotropic effects        These contrasting conclusions about how the niche of        these bacterial populations has evolved may actually be        reconciled if we consider the potential mechanisms of        adaptation  in fact they might inform our hunt for them        as well The contrary findings of novobiocin sensitivity        and bile salt resistance have already been presented but        these results along with other catabolic phenotypes        potentially limit the gene candidates upon which selection        may have acted to improve life in a simple glucoselimited        environment The fact that evolved clones appear to respire        several resources poorly yet are at least as fit as the        ancestor in the diverse LB environment suggest that        enhancements in the general growth potential of these        populations may compensate for these deficiencies This        argues indirectly that the mutations responsible for        reduced         fundamental diet breadth are either        completely silent in environments similar to the evolution        model or are in fact beneficial                        Conclusions        The expansion of the potential niche of these        populations into different media formulations is indeed        remarkable but should not be construed as an evolutionary        trend towards generalism Travisano and Lenski            demonstrated that  generations of evolution was        sufficient for these populations to lose fitness when grown        on alternative sugars and the reductions in maximum growth        rate at extreme temperatures suggest a trend towards        specialization in thermal niche     Together these        investigations of the correlated responses to adaptation to        a specific environment demonstrate the mismatch between the        arbitrary scales that we use to measure performance and        real biological alternatives Genetic variation need not        project phenotypes along a Celsius scale or among an        assortment of carbon sources As a result generalizations        about the nature of the evolution of specialization and        the clarification of the folk wisdom may elude us until        the mechanisms and tendencies of evolutionary change are        better revealed Thus despite the inclination to add        complexity to these microbial environments so as to better        simulate the real world it remains evident that we as        evolutionary geneticists still have our hands full                    Methods                  Measurement of diet breadth          Following closely the protocol described in Cooper and          Lenski     I used Biolog ES designed for           E coli and           Salmonella spp microtiter plates          to obtain estimates of catabolic diet breadth These          plates have  different carbon sources and a tetrazolium          indicator dye whose intensity is proportional to the          amount of respiration on that substrate I measured          optical density immediately after inoculation and then          after  hours of incubation the difference in these          figures less the reading from the blank well estimated          functionality on each resource Diet breadth is expressed          as the average performance relative to the ancestor on          all foreign resources Mathematical transformations          required to generate this average are described in detail          in Cooper and Lenski     Experiments were conducted          in two complete
