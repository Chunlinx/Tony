                                 Fiddling Around            We allknowsupposedlythat if John F Kennedy were president today he wouldnt beHis administration would have collapsed under the relentless reporting of hisdalliances with actresses such as Marilyn Monroe and Angie Dickinson unsavorycharacters such as mob moll Judith Campbell Exner suspected East German spyEllen Rometsch and twentysomething White House staffers known as Fiddle andFaddle Back in the s the mens club of reporters dined out on rumors ofKennedys adultery as they made sure those stories were kept out of thenewspapers We knew We all knew said former journalist and LBJ aide GeorgeReedy in historian Thomas Reeves book on Kennedy A Question ofCharacter  Answer to the Question rotten            But ithas become a journalistic truism that the club has been disbanded that todaythe press would pursue rumors of flagrant infidelity by a president As JosephLelyveld executive editor of The New York Times  recently told TheNew York Observer  It was always clear that given Clintons allegedhistory reckless philandering in the White House would be a story            For proof one only has to look at the scandalthat has engulfed the administration right Yet something nags about the storyof the yes yes alleged affair between Clinton and his very own FiddleMonica Lewinsky If such behavior is a legitimate story why has it taken sixyears to find out that Clintons rapacious sexual appetite has apparently neverbeen slaked but simply changed venue During this time the press has surely hadas much suspicion about Clintons misbehavior click for some samples as itdid of Kennedys but has chosen until recent weeks mostly to ignore ordismiss it            Onesimple reason is that today as in Kennedys day proof of presidentialmisbehavior is hard to come by We may all know JFK had an affair withMonroe but Seymour Hersh while writing The Dark Side of Camelot  wasso desperate for evidence that for a time he was duped by forged documentssupposedly proving the liaison In his history of the Kennedy era RichardReeves writes that Kennedy concerned that increasingly clamorous rumors of anaffair with Monroe might actually make it into print sent former journalistand Peace Corps official William Haddad to tell various publications thatKennedy himself said the stories werent true Years later Reeves writesHaddad said He lied to me He used my credibility with people I knewAttention Paul Begala            But when seemingly hard facts about Clintonspast have thrust themselves upon the media journalists have needed a differentjustification for turning them aside other than the s doctrine that it wasnone of the publics business That justification was the widely heldconvention that during his candidacy Clinton addressed the issues of his pastinfidelities however obliquely and that by electing him twice the public hadgiven him a pass Commentator Mark Shields has said of the Lewinsky scandalthat it represents a violation of a tacit agreement between Bill Clinton andthe American electorate in  That is the public would ignore his Arkansasshenanigans as long as they didnt continue in the White House Lets call itthe Ozark Exemption            Lelyveld says the New York Times decided not to pursue  allegationsof numerous simultaneous affairsmade by four Arkansas state troopers whoguarded thenGov Clintonbecause We made a deliberate choice  not to beaggressive on Clintons Arkansas philandering  partly because the countryhad voted on it Its debatable however how fully the public was informed ofthe extent of Clintons alleged womanizing As Newsweek recentlyreported among other tactics the campaign paid  to privateinvestigator Jack Palladino to find and discredit alleged Clinton paramoursLarry Sabato a political scientist at the University of Virginia told TheNew Yorker that Palladino led a very aggressive campaign to suppressinformation One reporter I spoke to who covered the race said he came tobelievebut of course never made publicthat Clinton had had hundreds oflovers            The handling of the Troopergate charges isillustrative of the medias discomfort with the whole subject In December both the Los Angeles Times and the Clintonbashing AmericanSpectator published similar versions of the story almost simultaneouslyThere was a small flurry of attention among the networks but according to theColumbia Journalism Review  CBS declined even to air the charges TheNew York Times wrote only reluctantly about it and the WashingtonPost treated it mostly as a media story Within the Los AngelesTimes  publication of the story was controversial Jack Nelson the papersWashington bureau chief at the time said there was conspiracy in myopinion by rightwingers to force the newspaper to run the story before itwas ready Representing the troopers was Arkansas attorney and avowedClintonhater Cliff Jackson who had tried to arrange for a rightwingfinancier to create a fund for the troopers before publication in case theylost their jobs                           Columbia Journalism Review writer Christopher Hanson even called for areturn to the standards of Kennedys day He wrote In the s after alljust a few dozen national reporters could define what is news and they wereable to decide that JFKs sexual adventures an open secret did not qualifyToday unfortunately the rationalists have lost the power to set standards ofrelevancy            There was a central charge in both the LosAngeles Times and American Spectator accounts that should have beena warning that Clintons predilections werent just history but also currentevents This was that Clinton after his election to the presidency  hadthe troopers escort a woman to the basement of the governors mansion to meethim at dawn while Hillary slept upstairs It also signaled a penchant for theconvenience and risk of cheating at homea trait for which Kennedy wasknown And a now eerily familiar phraseone that seems unlikely to be spokenspontaneouslyrecurs in the Los Angeles Times story When the papercontacted the unnamed woman said to have met Clinton in the basement sheresponded that there was no improper relationship Another woman confrontedby reporters at first denied even knowing Clinton Subsequently she told themshe and Clinton had not had an improper relationship            TheAmerican Spectator piece led directly to Paula Jones Identified only asPaula in the story she was described by one trooper as offering to becomeClintons girlfriend after their encounter She filed suit against Clinton in charging that Clinton had exposed himself to her But while she gotplenty of media attention her story was widely dismissed as irrelevant underthe Ozark Exemption or as the nattering of in the words of Newsweek sEvan Thomas some sleazy woman with big hair coming out of the trailerparksa remark for which he later apologized It wasnt until Stuart TaylorJrs  American Lawyer investigation that the rest of the mediabegan to take the charges though perhaps not Jones seriously The mediasclass bias protected Clinton from women like Jones and Gennifer Flowerssurelyhe couldnt be attracted to a woman who wasnt a Yale Law School graduate            The other significant story of Clintonscontinuing sexual adventuring was Michael Isikoffs account last August of amurky encounter between White House volunteer Kathleen Willey and thepresident The allegation reported in Newsweek  is that when Willey metalone with Clinton at the White House in  to ask for a paying job Clintonmade a pass at hera charge denied by the presidents attorney What Isikoffcouldnt pin down was whether the advance was welcome or not Among mediaheavyweights the story was about as welcome as a piece of kryptonite TheNew York Times didnt even cover the Willey story until the Lewinskyallegations broke in January and the Washington Post dismissed it as amedia imbrogliothe Drudge Report had leaked details beforepublication            Perhapsthe only person who took the account seriously was the president himselfRecent reports allege that Clinton broke off his sexual relationship withLewinsky around that time because he was afraid of the attention the Willeystory might provoke Kennedy too took action when liaisons became toodangerous For more on that click             The Lewinsky story exploded because it takesthe presidents behavior beyond the sexual into the criminalwith its loomingquestions of perjury and obstruction of justice Historian Thomas Reevesbelieves that despite the medias reluctance to look into Kennedys privatelife if he had lived to have a second term The realities of his lecheryand his dealings with Sam Giancana might have leaked out while he was still inoffice gravely damaging the presidency  Impeachment might well havefollowed such public disclosure In other words the careless only stay luckyfor so long
