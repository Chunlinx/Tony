           okay Carla can you tell me uh uh what type of movies do you like   um well i like uh i guess i like all kinds of movies but the ones i dont like are kind of like Monty Python that type of thing but i like all kinds of movies i like to see movies when they come out and uh i generally prefer watching movies that have the stars that i like like Arnold Schwarzenegger and that type thing   oh like the Terminator or   yeah i mean those are kind of rough for me sometimes but i still like him as an actor so i like watching those movies   i liked uh when he played in Twins did did you see that   uhhuh yeah i saw it   which was out of character for him you know playing such a a softy um i tend to uh i like the lighter movies myself   yeah yeah   rather than the uh the uh tear jerkers i think uh at least for me uh life is full of that stuff you know and it needs some light moments   yeah uhhuh i dont really like the tear jerker type either surprisingly surprisingly even though you know  just seems like i dont know they try to make things sad sometimes that really arent i dont know why did you see the movie Dad that was a movie that really really was good and really got me   um no uh who who was in that   uh had it was the guy from Cheers Ted Danson i think was in it that was so good   oh yeah yeah yes yes okay i like him in fact he was up hes hes big into uh uh ecology and he was up to save the Bay you know for uh Narragansett Bay   yeah umhum um   so he came i i actually i live in Rhode Island you know i work in Massachusetts because its not that far away but i live in Rhode Island so but no i didnt see that one i didnt um   uhhuh   were kind of uh uh we look at the movies and we say yeah were going to go and see them go and we probably dont usually end up until until they come out on in tape   uhhuh yeah   and then well go down to the video store and rent them and and look at them um i like uh   uh some science fiction movies i liked uh Alien i thought that was good   oh really   and uh uh Two Thousand and One   uhhuh   i dont know if youve did you   see i havent seen many of those but i do like them i mean no   you didnt see Two Thousand and One oh that was that was excellent that was if you if you get a chance you can you can rent it   yeah uhhuh   uh i like a lot of Gene Wilder i like him too   uhhuh   i like uh all the stuff that hes done and Mel Brooks   yeah   uh   what was the latest movie youve seen   the latest movie was uh Back to the Future part two or three whatever   yeah ive seen all those those are pretty good   yeah i like him i like   i liked the first one best i think   theyre usually yes the the first movie out is usually the best one and then they try and do other sequels some of the sequels   yeah   some work but most of them dont i think theyre trying too hard on the pushing but that seemed to that seemed to be pretty good i dont i dont i liked that um i havent seen any of the real uh new releases im trying to think of uh uh whats out there now actually not there isnt much of anything really uh   uhhuh ive seen like all the movies that come to the dollar theatre theres a dollar theatre in town we dont really pay um five bucks to go to see a movie because they have pretty good movies you know not too long after theyve been out at the dollar theatre so we go there we used to go there quite a bit we havent been there lately very much but i think the last movie i saw was Awakenings have you heard about that   um   it was more like a it was a true story it was based on a true story its about a its about a disease that that caused people to go into like total what do you call it  i mean   like a like a coma or amnesia or   kind kind of like a coma yeah and then they came out of it i wont tell you the rest   oh is that um um it was like a life after death experience something similar to that was was   no that was Ghost wasnt it  wasnt that Ghost i didnt see Ghost but ive heard   no i didnt see Ghost either um but i know what you mean ive i saw uh   it was based on a true story   i saw the what this was based on a true story   yeah yeah are are you thinking of uh Flatliners   yes thats the one right okay okay yeah yeah and they didnt want to come back   that was uh life yeah that was good that was real good right     or or they came back but they werent really back   well they uh they almost didnt make it back in a couple cases but uh they came back and their lives were different after that and all this it was it was pretty it was pretty neat     yes so youre in you like the you like all the Steven King   i have to go see it yeah um i dont like real scary movies though at all   yeah no im not um well Alien was Alien was Alien was yeah     was it see im not im not really into scary i mean i   it was it kept you on the end of your seat   uhhuh   um i dont like any of the Chainsaw Massacres and all that kind of stuff you know the the gory ones i dont care for them at all uh i just avoid all that uh   umhum yeah   and the like Friday the Thirteenth and them   yeah       ive never even seen any of those part one or zero or ten   yeah i dont like that but that getting back to that theatre you got you guys got a theatre down there that it only costs you a dollar and you can get in to see is that right   yeah and they have seven movies playing at once so its pretty good selection and theyre always you know top top rated movies i mean ive seen you know quite a bit of i just saw Kindergarten Cop there i guess that was the last movie i seen it was good i liked that   the what was it   Kindergarten Cop   oh thats with uh that was with Schwarzenegger too yeah yeah   Arnold yeah that was a softy movie   yeah   for him   thats right yeah thats right thats right um
