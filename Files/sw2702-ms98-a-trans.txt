        well as much as id uh id like to say that ill be looking for a flashy convertible or a or a four by four or something i guess the next car ill be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door   what kind of car do you have now   oh weve got a uh an older Delta Eighty Eight and then uh our our newer car is a uh a Corsica and uh well probably be looking for something about that uh that same style that same kind of four door hard top style and   yeah yeah you got kids   uh no but were planning for it so uh in fact uh our Oldsmobile is a is a like an old Delta Eighty Eight but its in pretty good shape its in really good shape and weve been really pleased with Oldsmobiles thats probably where the first place wed look   okay yeah yeah huh   but uh   well weve always had uh Fords uh mostly because my wifes stepfather works at a Ford dealership   uhhuh thatll do it   yeah thatll do it um but yeah were were in the same shape i think our next car will be a you know some big old four door  uh something that can haul the kids to baseball practice and piano lessons and  weve got a minivan   yep uhhuh   and thats great and i drive i drive uh well i used to drive an Escort but it died on me so i  i mean i i i used to run it i uh where we used to live i used to commute a hundred and forty miles a day     oh jeez   and uh and this Escort took it all and its it it got up to uh uh i was at ninety four thousand miles on it and the engine just went   umhum   so i i bought i bought a used um Dodge Aries   yeah   which has been okay i i mean i havent had it that long but  it itll its an eighty five Aries but it only had thirty four thousand miles on it when i bought it   really umhum oh jeez   and i just you know i just drive it to work so its just a ten minute commute everyday   umhum   so um it doesnt get much of uh i mean  its not like im putting it through its paces  but i think uh and its a four door which is nice but its still a little cramped ive got three kids   yeah yeah umhum yeah yeah sounds like you you need at least like a Taurus size or something like that   so i i yeah thats what i was thinking of was a Taurus um   yeah i i know i know a lot of the guys at work they uh the ones that have uh families uh and they still want kind of a sports car theyve been uh a lot of them been getting these uh Taurus SHOs that i guess its the sport version of the Taurus in fact it comes with a standard stick and uh   oh really  yeah ooh   and a lot of those it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that but uh   yeah   and usually theyre in like black and gun metal grey and and those kind of colors youre not gonna see too many uh you know green ones or blue ones or anything like that they they put them in sporty colors i guess but uh     yeah yeah well my wife wants a Miata   oh well sure  thats what you know until till you look at the price tag and then you go what what would i really besides tooling around and looking really cool and having a lot of fun what would i really do with this car if it what     right right yeah i know i know its like i i guess i could fit in it  maybe   yeah i i went i went through that when i first got out of uh college i had an old car that i bought just to get to to my job my first job   yeah   and when i got there the first thing i did was trade it in on a Spitfire and i i knew that was gonna be the only time i could afford a two seater uh sports car   no yeah   but that that just does not make it as an only car its uh its like i bought i would i bought a set of stereo speakers     yeah   and it was one of those cash and carry deals and i had to take them one at a time with the top down       and it was winter so i was like in this coat with the top down and the speaker in the passenger seat   oh no     and i drove that one home and then i went back and got the other one and put that in the passenger seat and drove that one home       and uh funny funniest sight and  you kind of outgrow that real quick when its your only car   yeah yeah well i you know its funny most people that ive talked to did stuff like that when they were in college or you know  or when they were single anyway theyd theyd buy themselves a sporty car because it was their last i never did that uh you know my first car was a Toyota Corolla   umhum yeah oh really   and uh because i got a good deal on it and uh that was a great little car actually   yeah   i met thats how i met girls was id find out if a girl could drive a manual transmission which i id never i id learned on an automatic transmission and so so id go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive this car   uhhuh boy thats a good deal   and uh in fact i married one of those people and it worked yeah it worked all right real good   ah okay well ill have to remember that if i ever get in that situation again huh because i i know weve uh thats thats something that that we definitely have to go with is an automatic transmission my um my wife just does cant cant cant uh  she doesnt really wanna learn i guess the uh the standard shift in fact i i remember once we uh   yeah yeah   we uh went uh went on a uh test drive we got one of these things from Lee Iacocca that said you know ill give you a fifty dollar savings bond if youll test drive a car and we went uh we went uh   yeah yeah   we went to a dealership and uh it it was it was pretty she she did pretty well but it was one of these things where we just went to a big parking lot and the uh dealer kind of gave her standard shift parking because thats all it was it was it was the funniest thing it was like a   yeah     a big Le Baron it was a Le Baron with everything on it but it had a standard shift it was the craziest thing i ever saw and and and thats probably why they were trying to sell them i guess   wow thats weird yeah huh   and uh we just kind of went back and forth and back and forth she did pretty well after a while but uh its its kind of hard to learn i guess   yeah well my wife i mean shed always driven standard transmission and uh and and in fact all our earlier cars were standard a standard transmission in fact the minivans a has a stick shift   umhum okay   and in fact this Dodge Aries is the first car weve ever gotten that had anything you know its got automatic transmission cruise control you know electric locks you know its like its like a luxury car except that its the Dodge Aries you know so uh   oh jeez yeah yeah what the oh well well i guess that i guess thats about all i got to say about cars   well  um the the thing about this uh the i will say this about the minivan   uhhuh   we thought that was a luxury car when we bought it it it   uhhuh i would think so yeah because its so big   yeah and and it was quiet it had a stereo system we never had it you know we always had the AM radio  and uh course this had stick shift it had speakers speakers that you can control from the backseat   oh yeah sure sure umhum   and you can change the channels on the on the radio from the backseat too and put speaker speaker phones in it so uh   uhhuh now now now that used to be a luxury but i bet on the next time you buy a car thats gonna be mandatory  youve got to have that now youre used to it and you got to have it   right thats right thats right and you got to pay for it too and i bet and i bet it costs twice as much as as when i bought mine   yeah thats true too it  probably does it probably does but uh oh well well Bill its been nice talking to you okay you have a good evening umhum byebye   well nice talking to you thanks a lot bye bye
