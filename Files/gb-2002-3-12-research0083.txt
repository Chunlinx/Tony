                    Background        In the lexicon of genomics an annotation is any feature        tied to the genomic DNA sequence for example a        proteincoding gene model a transposon or a        nonproteincoding RNA gene Adding such annotations to the        sequence of a genome in a rigorous and consistent way is a        prerequisite for the efficient use of that sequence in        biological research Learning how to identify display        query and interpret genome features in wellcharacterized        model organisms like the fruit fly         Drosophila melanogaster  is crucial        to understanding the genomes of more complex organisms        including         Homo sapiens         A major longterm goal of the FlyBase    annotation        project is to overlay the         Drosophila melanogaster genomic        sequence with all available biological information and to        provide traceable evidence for every annotation in a        publicly accessible database In this paper we provide a        description of our most recent step toward these goals        In March  a collaborative group including Celera        Genomics the Berkeley and European         Drosophila Genome Projects BDGP and        EDGP and a number of additional         Drosophila experts published the        annotated nearly finished genomic sequence of the fruit        fly    This annotated sequence was called Release         in anticipation of future changes to the sequence and        annotations At that time the annotation of genes relied        heavily on computational geneprediction algorithms with        only limited human curation The BDGP provided        approximately  expressed sequence tags ESTs mostly        from the  ends of genes which were used in the        computational analyses of the genome   Because these        ESTs were derived from nonnormalized cDNA libraries and        were limited in number they corresponded to only about         of all genes in the genome   Complete or nearly        complete sequences for an overlapping set of approximately         known         Drosophila genes in GenBankEMBLDDBJ        were also available   Owing to the nature of        wholegenome shotgun WGS assembly the  gaps present        in the genome tended to occur at the sites of repetitive        sequence   gaps corresponding to transposable elements        were filled with composite sequences reflecting sequence        reads from throughout the genome rather than the actual        sequence Release  predicted  proteincoding genes        encoding  transcripts each gene was assigned a        unique CG identifier The coordinates and predicted        sequences of the annotations although not the evidence for        the predictions were made available to GenBankEMBLDDBJ               and FlyBase the public databases        charged with making these annotations accessible to the        research community In FlyBase the annotations were made        available as part of the genome annotation database Gadfly                 Release  a collaborative effort between Celera        Genomics and the BDGP was submitted to GenBankEMBLDDBJ        and FlyBase in October  after approximately  of the        gaps in the Release  sequence had been filled Changes to        the annotations were based largely on approximately         new  ESTs sequenced by the BDGP which increased the        number of genes with  UTRs and allowed further refinement        in gene structures Sequences of transposable elements        remained inaccurate being based on composite sequences In        all  transcripts were modified  transcripts were        deleted and  transcripts were added Release         predicted  proteincoding genes encoding         polypeptides of which   were unchanged relative        to Release  Thus the change from Release  to Release         was minimal        Inaccuracies in the Release  and  predicted gene        structures resulted mainly from computationally predicted        annotations which lacked supporting cDNA data In addition        the annotation was carried out rapidly by a large and        diverse group of curators Mistakes in the annotation of        more than  genes were reported to FlyBase in error        reports from the community and over  discrepancies        between the translated annotations and those in the curated        protein database SWISSPROT   were reported by Karlin         et al    Finally a report of         new predicted annotations that did not match any of        the original  predicted genes   and another        based on analysis of testes cDNA sequences   suggested        that the initial annotation may have missed a substantial        number of genes        The         D melanogaster  megabase Mb        euchromatic genomic sequence has now been finished to high        quality   Here we report the results of the        reevaluation of previous annotations in light of the        finished euchromatic genome and considerable additional        experimental data We call this sequence and new annotation        set Release         To support this reannotation effort a computational        pipeline was created and the results were stored in a        new Gadfly database so that evidence for the annotations        can be tracked and queried by the public   To identify        new features in the genome we utilized prediction software        and annotated alignments of nonproteincoding genes        transposons   and pseudogenes To improve the extent        and consistency of human curation a small group of expert        FlyBase curators visually inspected each gene in the entire        euchromatic sequence using defined rules to integrate        computational analyses cDNA data and protein alignments        into updated annotations To assess the accuracy of the        exonintron structures we compared the resulting        annotations to the subset of curated peptides in SWISSPROT        and TrEMBL that are based on experimental evidence                 The annotations in Release  alter the majority  of        gene models yet confirm that previous releases accurately        reflected the number of proteincoding genes The gene        models have been enhanced in a number of ways The number        of genes with annotated untranslated regions UTRs and        alternative transcripts has increased as a direct result of        the increase in EST and complete cDNA sequences and the        fine details of the exonintron structure are significantly        improved Numerous genes have been merged andor split         that is the partitioning of adjacent exons into individual        gene models has changed  based on cDNA and protein        sequence alignments Overall the improved annotations        result in changes in more than  of the predicted        proteins however more than  of the exons in the        originally predicted genes contain sequences that are        present in predicted exons in Release  We describe these        changes under the headings Genome statistics how is        Release  different New and deleted annotations and        Structural changes to gene models in Results and        discussion        The new annotations reveal a surprising number of genes        that fall outside the typical definition of a        proteincoding gene model with a  UTR coding sequence        CDS and  UTR distinct from neighboring genes We found        genes containing  UTR sequences that overlap the  UTR        of the gene immediately downstream examples of dicistronic        transcripts two or more distinct and nonoverlapping        coding regions contained on a single processed mRNA and        genes that by means of alternative splicing encode two        completely distinct nonoverlapping peptides These        atypical gene models illustrate the complexity of detailed        annotation and pose new challenges for the computational        annotation of genomic sequence We describe these unusual        genes as well as assessment of and access to the data        under the headings Complex gene models Assessment of        Release  quality Accessing data and reporting errors        and Future updates                    Results and discussion                  Genome statistics how is Release           different                      Increase in the number of exons and transcripts            but not genes            Although the reannotation process changed the            majority of gene models the number of proteincoding            genes changed minimally from  genes in Release             to  genes in Release  to  in Release  of            which  are in the euchromatin Table  and             in the heterochromatin   However the Release             gene structures have changed to contain more exons The            total number of unique exons in euchromatin defined as            having unique sequence coordinate termini has            increased  from  in Release  to  in            Release  see Table  The number of proteincoding            exons has increased as well from  to  we            define a proteincoding exon here as any exon            containing CDS even if the majority of the exon is            UTR The consequence is that the average number of            exons per gene has increased from  in Release  to             in Release  which is very similar to             C elegans    and             Arabidopsis    but            significantly lower than             H sapiens  see for example                         A major contributor to the increase in exons is the            increase in the number of proteincoding genes with            identified  UTRs One limitation of             ab initio gene prediction            programs is that they predict only open reading frames            ORFs EST and fulllength cDNA data are absolutely            essential to identify UTRs The expanded set of            available ESTcDNA data led to a significant increase            in the number of annotated genes and transcripts with             UTRs from  of the genes in Release  to  in            Release  and  UTRs from  of the genes in            Release  to  in Release  Table  These numbers            reflect data availability sequences from cDNA clones            representing at least one transcript from approximately             of the genes in             Drosophila were supplemented by a            large number of additional  ESTs    The            length of the UTRs also increased with these new data            Table  the average  UTR length per transcript            for genes with annotated UTRs increased by  to             nucleotides and the average  UTR length for            genes with UTRs by  to  nucleotides            Four times as many genes in Release   as            compared to Release   show alternative transcripts            Table  The vast majority of these are due to            alternative splicing an introduced bias see Materials            and methods but  are due to alternative promoters            and  to alternative polyadenylation sites            Alternative splicing results in the  increase in the            number of proteincoding transcripts and is largely            responsible for a  increase in the number of unique            protein species from  in Release  to  in            Release                                 Fortyfive percent of predicted proteins differ            from Release             The changes in gene models also result in larger            proteins Proteins in Release  have a mean length of             amino acids and a median of  amino acids This            is an increase compared to Release  where the mean            was  amino acids and the median  amino acids The            longest transcript and protein are encoded by             dumpy dp  which encodes a            massive  kilobase kb mRNA and a  aminoacid            polypeptide The Dp protein is a component of the            extracellular matrix and appears to serve as an            elastic adhesion molecule at cuticlecell junctions            such as the epidermalcuticle interface              The vast majority  of the Release  annotations            contain sequences that are present in exons from            Release  however only  of the unique peptides in            Release  are unchanged in Release  Table  Of the             unique Release  peptides   are exact            matches to Release  peptides Reciprocally  of the            peptides are different from Release  emphasizing            that although the overall picture of the number and            distribution of transcription units in the             D melanogaster genome remains            largely the same the new annotations include many            changes to the protein products encoded by the            genome                                    New and deleted annotations                      Transposable elements            The sequences of the vast majority of transposons in            Releases  and  were composites derived from a number            of copies of that transposon type In Release  these            composite sequences are replaced with the actual            sequences present in the sequenced             y              cn              bw              sp strain for each individual            element    In all  transposons are            annotated in the euchromatic Release  genome Table              long terminal repeat LTR transposons             LINE transposons  terminal inverted repeat TIR            transposons and  foldback FB elements These data            include both fulllength and partial elements Details            of these analyses are reported in an accompanying            article                                  Nonproteincoding RNA genes            Small nonproteincoding RNAs are also included in            this reannotation We searched for new tRNA genes            using the program tRNAscanSE   and Sim alignments            to known tRNAs  are annotated in the euchromatin            Table  Release  reported  tRNAs   two tRNA            genes were deleted as a result of sequence finishing            resolving repeated regions of the genome            Other nonproteincoding RNAs are limited in            general to those already curated in the FlyBase            database    All  of the known microRNAs in             Drosophila are located precisely            in the Release  genome We annotated the majority of            the  small nuclear RNAs snRNAs involved in            splicing with the exception of the four snRNAs Ka            Kb K and K   for which there were no sequence            or cytological data available Of the  snRNAs            supported by such data we found that nine were            redundant entries and another five could not be            identified at the previously specified cytological            locations possibly due to strain variation andor            inaccuracy in previous localization experiments Thus            we precisely located by sequence alignment  snRNAs in            the genome including a new copy of the             snRNAUatac gene in the A            region            All nine of the small nucleolar RNA snoRNA genes            in FlyBase were identified by Sim alignment of            sequence obtained from the literature In addition we            incorporated data from Tycowski and Steitz   and            located  more snoRNAs Identification of other            snoRNAs should be possible in the future with the use            of algorithms like Snoscan which looks for Oribose            methylation guide snoRNAs   however the program            will have to be customized for             Drosophila             The longer nonproteincoding RNA genes              element bft RNasePRNA Hsromega            SLRNA pgc roX roX  and             iab  are annotated in the            genome  new miscellaneous noncoding RNA genes            were detected by alignment of spliced DGC cDNAs that            did not appear to contain an ORF of significant length            In some cases these appear to be candidate antisense            genes which have also been reported in other organisms              Further experiments will be necessary to verify            the existence of these interesting genes and to            determine their function                                Pseudogenes            The number of pseudogenes reported in             Drosophila is substantially            smaller than that in             Caenorhabditis elegans               We annotated the  pseudogenes in FlyBase that map to            the euchromatic sequence and correspond to            proteincoding paralogs see Supplementary Table  in            the additional data files We identified five new            pseudogenes four histones and one lectin              CR  Supplementary Table             Of these  pseudogenes  are recombinationally            derived with introns in tandem to their functional            paralogs one              MgstlPsi  is retrotransposed            with a polyA tail lacking introns which its            functional paralog possesses and one is too            degenerate to classify definitively We did not make            any attempt to comprehensively survey for new            retrotransposed pseudogenes or annotate pseudogenes            identified by Echols             et al    WormBase               currently reports  pseudogenes in             C elegans  It is very likely            that a subset of the genes identified as proteincoding            genes in Release  are actually pseudogenes In            particular  proteincoding genes were noted as            containing a probable mutation in the sequenced            strain and more than  were marked problematic            because of inconsistencies with the experimental            evidence and the predicted ORFs                                New proteincoding genes            Release  contains a total of  new proteincoding            genes Table  that is gene models that show no            overlap with exons in Release  Of these   are            based solely on geneprediction data and  of these             are based on GENSCAN predictions alone Unlike            Releases  and  which relied heavily on Genie              Release  annotations did utilize GENSCAN predictions            with at least one exon with a score   in the            absence of other data The majority of the new genes            show matches to EST   or fullinsert cDNA            sequences   indicating the importance of            these alignments in identifying new genes missed by the                        ab initio gene prediction            programs An additional set of new genes was identified            by the community in error reports   or in            GenBankEMBLDDBJ submissions   Finally we            created   new annotations in Release  using            protein homology data from BLASTX analysis arising            from the comparison of translated Release  sequence            with sequence of other proteins in             Drosophila or other model            organisms in the absence of other supporting data            Release  sequence finishing had the largest            impact on areas of repetitive sequence because the            Release  WGS sequence assembly often collapsed these            regions   Duplicated sequences present assembly            challenges to genome sequencing efforts tandemly            duplicated genes tend to collapse in sequence assembly            and cannot be annotated until the duplications are            resolved Wholegenome analysis of the Release             sequence suggested that             Drosophila has fewer newly            duplicated genes than nematodes or yeast   We            investigated whether sequence finishing might have            uncovered previously undiscovered duplicated genes in             Drosophila  From this analysis            we found that the number of newly duplicated genes is            more similar to             C elegans and             Saccharomyces cerevisiae than            previously believed            We measured the frequency of newly annotated            duplicated genes by comparing each of the transcripts            encoded by the  new genes in Release  to all            Release  transcripts using the BLASTN program Of the            new genes   have duplicate genes             identity probability    e  somewhere in the            genome whereas  of a random sample of             Drosophila genes have duplicates            by this measure Thirtysix new genes are in repeat            regions that were collapsed in Release  and have now            been resolved For example in the previously annotated            tengene trypsin cluster on chromosome arm R three            new trypsin genes              CG CG CG  have            been added   and Figure                                 Deleted proteincoding genes            We rejected a total of  Release  genes during            the Release  reannotation Table  primarily on the            basis of a lack of supporting computational or            experimental evidence see Materials and methods            Nineteen Release  genes were deleted because they were            contained within transposable elements If based solely            on computational geneprediction evidence genes that            were less than an arbitrary length of  amino acids            were deleted We required an arbitrary length of             amino acids for all annotations not specifically            supported by literature references for example the            DIRG genes   and  of the deleted Release             annotations were removed because they failed to meet            this criterion Figure a inset            The sizes of the predicted protein products in            Release  and Release  were compared Figure a            along with the protein sizes of Release  annotations            deleted in Release  and sizes of proteins newly added            in Release  Figure b When examining the size range            of  amino acids there is a marked decrease in            Release  annotations compared to Release  due to the            more stringent data requirements for small annotations            in Release  Figure b inset                                    Structural changes to gene models                      Gene merges            Evidence supporting the merger of gene models came            mainly from the alignment of fulllength cDNA sequences            and to a lesser extent from protein homology            evidence Merges based solely on BLASTX similarity were            more difficult as the exact exonintron structure of            the merged model was not experimentally indicated A            total of  Release  genes were merged to form              of total Release  genes Sometimes the original            predictions were spaced quite far apart in the genome            a probable reason that the gene prediction algorithms            separated the exons For example multiple ESTs support            a merge of             CG and the             Flotillin gene              Flo or             CG  adding two  exons            almost  kb away from the Release  annotation of the             Flo gene Figure  The new             Flo transcript encodes a            protein with an additional  amino acids at its amino            terminus                                Gene splits            Gene model splits were often necessitated by the            facts that geneprediction programs such as Genie and            GENSCAN can string together genes that lie close to            each other and do not resolve nested genes Of the            Release  genes  were split to form   of            total Release  genes For example the annotated gene                        CG  with  exons in Release             Figure  appears to have been based on a Genie            prediction note that GENSCAN had predicted two            separate genes EST evidence and BLASTX homology to            other fly proteins indicated that this gene should be            split into two threeexon genes             CG and             CG  One  UTR exon and one            proteincoding exon in             CG were missed by both Genie            and GENSCAN Thus neither Genie nor GENSCAN correctly            predicted the structure of these two genes each            correctly predicted aspects of the gene models but EST            and BLASTX data were necessary to accurately determine            the structure of the two genes                                Gene splitsmerges            Gene splitsmerges were defined as changes involving            more than one gene in both Release  and  While not            common splitsmerges are interesting in that they            involve simultaneous restructuring of multiple Release             annotations One notable example is the split of             CG into the             CG and             sns annotations Figure  In            this instance BLASTX GenBankEMBLDDBJ and cDNA            records indicate that the  half of             CG should be split off as a            separate gene model              CG  while the            GenBankAF record indicates that the  exon of             CG plus six other Release             annotations should be merged into the extensive             sns annotation There were             cases in which Release  annotations suffered a            reassignment of exons more complex than a simple gene            split or merge to generate Release  annotations                                    Complex gene models                      Nested genes            The phenomenon of genes within genes in which a            gene is included within the intron of another gene is            common In the analysis of the  Mb             Adh region of             Drosophila  the frequency of            nested genes was reported to be approximately               In extending this analysis to the entire euchromatin            we find that   of all Release  genes            including noncoding RNAs are included within the            introns of other genes Of the  nested            proteincoding genes the majority  are            transcribed from the opposite strand of the including            gene We observed  cases in which the exons and            introns of a gene pair are interleaved Transposons may            also be located within the introns of genes we            observed  such cases                                Overlapping genes            We analyzed the mRNAs predicted for neighboring            genes to find those transcripts that share common            nonproteincoding genomic sequence About  of            annotated genes  involve the overlap of mRNAs on            opposite strands Some of these involve overlapping            messages that have been previously described for            example             Dopa decarboxylase and             CG   however the vast            majority were not previously known to overlap            Complementary sequences between distinct RNAs from            overlapping genes on opposite strands have previously            been reported in eukaryotes and have been implicated in            regulating gene expression for reviews see               For example the complementary sequence shared between             Dopa decarboxylase and             CG is thought to be involved            in regulating the levels of these transcripts              The large number of such overlapping transcripts            identified here raises the possibility that antisense            interactions may not be an uncommon mechanism for            regulating gene expression in             Drosophila             We were surprised to find over  cases of            overlapping genes on the same strand for which            cDNAEST data indicate that the  UTR of the upstream            gene overlaps the  UTR of the downstream gene In            some instances the  UTR of the upstream gene extends            past the postulated translation start of the downstream            gene One example of such an overlapping model is             CG and             Spn CG  tandem genes            encoding serine protease inhibitors Figure  The two            gene models are individually supported by a variety of            BLASTX data as well as fullinsert cDNA sequences            Interestingly the  exon of the DGC cDNA clone            covering the             Spn gene AT is entirely            included in the most exon of the             CG DGC cDNA clone GH            The existence of overlapping genes raises many            questions Are such pairs of genes typically            coregulated Where are the transcriptional regulatory            elements for the downstream gene What are the            structural constraints on the overlapping            sequences                                Alternatively transcribed genes            One mechanism for increasing potential protein and            regulatory diversity is through the production of            alternative transcripts Approximately  of Release             genes have more than one predicted transcript and this            is almost certainly an underestimate Many instances of            internal alternative splicing as well as alternative            polyadenylation will have been missed as our dataset            of cDNA sequences contained many more  ESTs than             ESTs or complete cDNAs As cDNA collections are            expanded including those representing specific stages            tissues and cell types additional genes with multiple            transcripts and additional protein species produced by            alternative splicing will undoubtedly be identified            Despite likely underestimation the level of            alternative splicing that was observed clearly            illustrates that alternative splicing is an important            mechanism for generating transcript diversity in             Drosophila see Supplementary            Table  in the additional data files            Alternative splicing creates opportunities for            diversity both at the level of gene regulation and of            protein diversity In Release   of the  genes            encoding multiple transcripts generate only one protein            product the transcripts differ only in their UTRs            Very commonly these alternative transcripts vary in            the location of  noncoding exons suggesting the use            of alternative promoters and offering the possibility            of differential regulation The other  of genes with            alternative transcripts encode two or more protein            products indicating that alternative splicing            generates considerable protein diversity in             Drosophila             A large number of related proteins can be produced            from a single gene by the simple substitution of a            single domain This mechanism has been taken to an            extreme level in the case of             modmdg  which produces at            least  distinct transcripts that share  exons but            are alternatively spliced to an array of different             exons    Remarkably eight of these transcripts            appear to be generated by a             trans splicing mechanism using            variable  exons encoded on the opposite strand            Seven             trans spliced variants were            previously reported    our analysis suggests            eight Although we did not find any further examples            of             trans splicing we did find that            a similar gene             lola  generates at least             alternative transcripts including four previously            described   The many             lola transcripts also share             exons but contain one of an array of different             exons Both             lola and             modmdg encode families of            specific RNA polymerase II transcription factors that            include a BTBPOZ dimerization domain near each amino            terminus                modmdg has been implicated in            a range of cellular and developmental processes            including chromatin insulator functions   and            apoptosis   and it has been suggested that its            many different isoforms underlie the pleiotropic nature            of this gene              Alternative splicing can produce two or more            distinct nonoverlapping protein products from a single            premRNA species we identified  such cases for            example             Vanaso and              Spec  see Figure  The mRNAs            produced most commonly share  UTR sequences but may            also share  UTR sequences FlyBase defines complexes            of this type as two separate genes since two            nonoverlapping protein products are produced Although            other groups sometimes describe such genes as            dicistronic since the unprocessed transcript is            dicistronic we do not include this type in our            categorization of dicistronic genes see below The            component coding regions are resolved on separate            mRNAs and thus internal translation initiation is not            required We view these cases as one extreme along a            continuum of protein diversity created by alternative            splicing                                Dicistronic genes            Examples of dicistronic transcripts have been            previously reported in             Drosophila                     Our results confirm that while not            common numerous examples of apparent dicistronic            transcripts are encountered in             Drosophila  We limit the term            dicistronic to genes that meet the following            criteria two distinct and nonoverlapping coding            regions contained on a single processed mRNA requiring            internal initiation of translation of the downstream            CDS In order to categorize a transcript as            dicistronic we required that each CDS exceed  amino            acids in length and show some similarity to known            proteins The Release  annotation contains  gene            pairs that can be described as dicistronic by these            criteria Figure  and see Supplementary Table  in            additional data files This includes  cases for            which the dicistronic transcript is represented by a            single cDNA There are  additional pairs denoted as            putative for which there is insufficient BLASTX            evidence to support both ORFs in a dicistronic gene            model see Supplementary Table  Since the            determination of genes as dicistronic requires multiple            classes of data to confirm the transcript structure and            validate the coding regions there are undoubtedly            additional dicistronic genes yet to be uncovered            throughout the genome            For many of the predicted dicistronic genes             there is evidence supporting alternative monocistronic            transcripts for either the upstream or downstream            CDS or for both This includes             MoscAMoscB  for which the            monocistronic transcript encodes a fusion protein            encompassing both CDSs   In some cases the            dicistronic form may be less prevalent than the            monocistronic forms it has been estimated that the            dicistronic             AdhAdhr transcript is only  as            abundant as that of the             Adh monocistronic transcripts                         Translation of the second CDS of a dicistronic            transcript requires that initiation of translation            occur at an internal site There are two proposed            mechanisms for the initiation of internal translation            One mechanism is that internal initiation occurs by            partial disassembly of the ribosome at the termination            of translation of the first CDS followed by continued            scanning by the S ribosomal subunit   The            following conditions are thought to be criteria for the            ribosomal scanning mechanism an absence of any ATG            codons in the intercistronic region an intercistronic            region of  to  bp and an optimized consensus            translation start site for the second CDS We assessed            the sizes of intercistronic regions and the number of            ATGs in these regions and found that there are seven            pairs of dicistronic genes that appear to conform to            this pattern indicated in Supplementary Table  The            majority of dicistronic cases clearly do not conform to            such a model of partial ribosome disassembly and            continued scanning In four cases the intercistronic            region is less than  bp However most of the            annotated dicistronic pairs are separated by several            hundred base pairs and the separation can be as much            as  kb In these longer intercistronic regions            there may be multiple ATG codons before the second            translation start site A mechanism of translation            initiation utilizing an internal ribosome entry site            IRES   appears a better explanation for these            cases Oh             et al    have hypothesized            that certain             Drosophila genes with long             UTRs might be translated via internal ribosome entry            If this is the case translation of the second CDS            within a dicistronic transcript may be effected by the            same initiation mechanism                                    Assessment of Release  quality                      Did we miss genes            Andrews             et al    suggested that the            number of genes in             Drosophila might be a severe            underestimate based on  testes EST sequences they            generated and aligned to the annotated genome However            using their data as well as  additional            testesderived ESTs   we predict a similar number            of genes in Release  as in previous releases The more            likely explanation for their results is that  exons            and not genes were underpredicted in             Drosophila  since there is EST            evidence for testesspecific promoters and transcripts              In most cases the testes ESTs did not align to            Release  genes because only the downstream CDS had            previously been annotated for those genes whereas in            Release  the UTRs that match the testes ESTs are            annotated            Gopal             et al    reported             novel genes that were not included in the Release             annotation After completing our reannotation we            compared this set of  genes to our data We found            that  of their predicted genes mapped to            euchromatin  mapped to heterochromatin  mapped            within transposable elements and  could not be found            in the Release  genomic sequence Of the  that            mapped to euchromatin   do match Release             annotations The remaining  did not match Release             annotations leading to the possibility that some or            all of these may represent novel genes Incorporating            their methods threading GENSCAN predictions to look            for structural homology into our computational            approach may uncover additional missed genes            One way to address the quality of the Release             annotations is by comparative sequence analysis In an            accompanying paper C Bergman             et al    surveyed sequence            conservation in approximately  Mb of the             D melanogaster genome containing             genes using comparative data from four             Drosophila species              D erecta D pseudoobscura D            willistoni and             D littoralis  Their comparison            to our             D melanogaster annotations            detected no genes conserved in other species that were            missed in Release               Other genes likely to be missed are genes with small            ORFs because of the arbitrary length cutoffs we used            see Materials and methods and genes expressed            transiently during development at very low levels            andor in cells and tissues not represented by the DGC            cDNA libraries Future DGC cDNA clones will be            generated by directed screening of cDNA libraries with            probes matching predicted exons   and cDNAs            selected during the reannotation process to represent            alternative transcripts not currently in the DGC                                Reliance on gene prediction data versus cDNA            data            Of the final set of annotations  contain            sequences that are present in Geniepredicted exons and             contain sequences that are present in            GENSCANpredicted exons Table  Only   of            proteincoding gene models were created without an             ab initio model that is solely            on the basis of cDNA or protein homology evidence The            fact that  of our accepted annotations span a region            containing a gene prediction supports both the strength            of the prediction programs algorithms as well as our            reliance on them for our methods However both Genie            and GENSCAN gene models were often wrong in detail            when compared to cDNA sequence alignments for three            main reasons first exon misassociations the            programs placed exons from one gene with the exons of a            neighboring or nested gene second erroneous splice            site calls the donor and acceptor sites were slightly            misplaced or third missed mini and microexons            small ORFs were not identified               The fraction of gene models that are based solely on            gene prediction data has decreased considerably from              in Release  to   in Release             Table  This shift was primarily due to the more            recently available             Drosophila EST and cDNA            sequences rather than newly evident similarity to            sequences in other species            Alignment of fulllength cDNA sequences from the            same strain continues to be the best way to annotate            gene models     The number of ESTs generated            by the BDGP project increased from around  in            Release  to  in Release    and the number            of sequenced fullinsert cDNAs from around  in            Release  to over  in Release    For            approximately  of these the completely assembled            sequence was available during the reannotation effort            see Materials and methods In addition  ESTs            from the community deposited in dbEST   including            a set of  from a testes cDNA library   were            available In all  of the proteincoding genes show            a match to an EST sequence Table  and over half to            fullinsert cDNA sequences We anticipate further            improvement to gene models as more cDNA data become            available                                Nonconsensus splice sites and small            introns            All introns within proteincoding genes were            examined for conserved GTAG splice junctions with the            Sequin program    and all instances of            annotations lacking GTAG splice junctions were            inspected and commented on Of the  total splice            junctions  are annotated with GCAG splice            junctions a frequency that might justify describing GC            as an alternative splice donor Eleven instances of            ATAC splice junctions are annotated An especially            well supported example of ATAC usage is             CG  which has more than             confirming ESTs Other cases of nonconsensus splice            sites appear rare however more are likely to be            documented in the future The particular alignment            algorithm used see Materials and methods and our            reliance upon geneprediction data imposed a bias            against unconventional splice sites In a number of            cases for which an unconventional splice junction was            supported by cDNA data the precise location of the            junction could not be determined owing to repeated            sequence at the donor and acceptor sites A good            example of this type of pattern is             sba CG  Two alternative            transcripts for this gene are supported by cDNA data            and both appear to contain an unconventional ambiguous            splice junction The two transcripts share the            unconventional splice acceptor site they differ in the            location of the nonconsensus splice donor site but            the two donor sites are identical in sequence            We also examined every gene model with an intron            less than  bp The frequency of such introns in             Drosophila is low  are            annotated in Release  There are several well            supported examples of introns less than  bp with at            least two supporting cDNAs derived from the sequenced            strain These include             modr and             csul  each with an intron of             bp and             CG  with a diminutive            intron of  bp                                SWISSPROTTrEMBL validation of the models            We used the SWISSPROT and TrEMBL protein databases              and the PEPQC software program   to validate            the integrity of the annotations and to track            consistency with previously published data see            Materials and methods Of the  annotated peptides            with a cognate in the curated SWISSPROTTrEMBL            dataset   were of identical length and had            more than  sequence identity Curators examined each            case with less than  sequence identity and in some            cases annotation errors were detected and corrected            For example translation start sites were shifted to            the experimentally reported position which in some            cases was downstream of the predicted start However            in most cases discrepancies appeared to be due to            strainspecific polymorphisms or errors in the reported            DNA sequence on which the SPTRreal entries were based            see Materials and methods Given the high quality of            the underlying Release  genomic sequence we believe            that in many cases the Release  annotation is more            accurate than the sequences deposited by the community            in SWISSPROT and TrEMBL                                Confidence in Release  gene models            The amount of evidence attributable to each Release             gene model varies considerably and therefore our            confidence in these gene models even the confidence in            two alternative transcripts encoded by the same gene            may differ greatly To estimate the reliability of a            gene model we developed a classification system that            groups data into four categories computational gene            predictions protein similarities alignments of ESTs            and other partial cDNA sequences and alignments of            fullinsert cDNA sequences One point was assigned to            each data type that overlapped a given annotation and            a score of  to  was determined for each transcript            with  being the lowest and  being the highest            confidence see Materials and methods As shown in            Table  more than  of transcripts and more than             of genes were assigned a confidence value of  or             Thus we have high confidence in a large proportion of            the Release  gene models                                Limitations in our methods            The Release  annotations should be much more            consistent than in previous releases because fewer            curators were involved a defined set of rules was            used and additional validation steps were performed            see Materials and methods We set a rigorous standard            for the annotations by requiring attributable evidence            for every gene model for example a gene prediction            an alignment to a GenBankEMBLDDBJ accession or a            curated personal communication to FlyBase However            during the Release  analysis             Drosophila researchers annotated            particular families of genes about which they were            expert and for which they may have had specific            unpublished information Much of the evidence for these            annotations was not released to the public domain and            is not currently available so some of the details of            these gene models were lost in Release  The solution            in these cases is for biologists in the community to            continue to submit error reports to FlyBase to be            curated by FlyBase as personal communications The            resulting set of annotations will be stronger because            every gene has traceable evidence that is available in            the database and is annotated according to a standard            set of rules            As is expected with such a complex analysis rules            cannot be expected to cover every eventuality As a            result some of the annotations are based partially on            curator judgment introducing a potential source of            inconsistency Visual inspection and curator expertise            were absolutely necessary in overcoming shortcomings of            the automated processes such as identifying GC splice            donors and sorting out complex gene models It was also            essential for annotating unusual cases such as the            dicistronic genes and overlapping gene models Further            it should be noted that manual annotation is an            iterative process Subsequent to an initial annotation            call a set of automatic verification steps was carried            out Potential errors were reviewed and where            appropriate annotations were modified as a result of            the verification analysis                                    Accessing data and reporting errors          The Release  genomic sequence available at          GenBankEMBLDDBJ   includes all gene models that is          the extent of transcripts and each corresponding CDS          More complete information including all classes of          evidence can be obtained from FlyBase presented in          Gadfly Gene Annotation reports in interactive Genome          Browser maps in the Apollo annotation tool and by batch          download In addition to transcript structures the Gene          Annotation report presents the evidence supporting a gene          model any comments included by the annotator and a          thumbnail view of the immediate genomic region There are          links to the reports for adjacent genes to the FlyBase          Genome Browser view of the surrounding region and to          FASTA files of protein transcript and genomic          sequences Another link takes users to the results of          automated BLASTP and InterProScan   analyses of the          predicted peptides The coordinates comments and          subfeatures of the annotations such as UTRs exons and          so on can be downloaded in a number of formats          including XML and GFF The interactive genome browser          shows all transcripts annotated within a region a zoom          feature allows the user to choose the level of          resolution Additional data classes can be added at the          discretion of the user including the extent of DGC cDNA          clones and EST data the BAC clones used for          determination of the genomic sequence and the position          of Pelement insertions isolated by the BDGP Gene          Disruption Project            Researchers can also use the Apollo genome annotation          and curation tool   to view the supporting data in          greater detail This Java software tool is available for          local installation   and bulk downloads of the          annotations and computational evidence are available in          XML or GFF format   Sequence data in multiple FASTA          format for the entire set of annotations are also          available at this site In addition Apollo includes          software to request and retrieve the annotations and          other data transparently from FlyBaseBDGP Many          individual investigators have already contributed          substantially to the Release  annotations by submitting          corrections to gene structures using the error report          forms   and researchers can continue to submit          reports to FlyBase in this manner In the future we hope          that by enabling researchers to send an Apollo XML output          file to FlyBase for review error reporting of fine gene          structures will be simplified                          Future updates                      Changes to the sequence            The BDGP will continue to finish the remaining            problematic regions of the euchromatic genomic sequence            to high quality see   and focus efforts on            refining the sequence of the heterochromatin              Changes to the sequence will be submitted to            GenBankEMBLDDBJ every  to  months            Because sequence updates at the time of new releases            will result in changes to the coordinate system for            each chromosome arm and for GenBankEMBLDDBJ accession            units it will be particularly important for            researchers to make note of specific release and            version dates when providing sequence coordinates            FlyBase encourages researchers to refer to coordinates            as associated with specific GenBankEMBLDDBJ accession            and version numbers                                Changes to gene models            Future reannotation will be on a genebygene            basis rather than a survey of the entire genome            Future analyses will include new largescale datasets            including the             Anopheles gambiae genomic            sequence the             D pseudoobscura genomic            sequence and additional DGC cDNA sequences              Changes to the gene models will occur more often than            changes in the sequence and will be reported in            datestamped updates of the GenBankEMBLDDBJ            accessions and FlyBase records Such changes are            reflected in the feature annotations only and thus do            not constitute new releases as the underlying genomic            sequence does not change            FlyBase will also focus on the localization of many            more annotation features to the genome view such as            regulatory elements mutational lesions rearrangement            breakpoints and Pelement insertion sites Many of            these sequence features are already in the FlyBase            genetic data tables and gene annotation reports based            on data from literature curation computational            analyses for example   and largescale projects            such as the BDGP Gene Disruption Project                                Changes to functional annotation            In the annotation of genes in Release  attributes            of gene products were predicted with respect to their            molecular functions the roles they might play in            biological processes and their cellular locations            using the controlled vocabularies developed by the Gene            Ontology GO Consortium   These predictions were            computational using a program known as LOVEATFIRSTSITE            written by M Yandell   Since then FlyBase            curators have assessed each of these annotations            retaining in FlyBase only those that were reasonably            secure and have reannotated many genes with GO terms            of higher granularity This work together with the            curation of GO terms from the literature and sequence            records has resulted in  genes sharing  GO            annotations This analysis has not yet been repeated            for the Release  gene products but the curation of GO            terms for all new genes and all splitmerged genes is            now in progress When this annotation is completed we            will have a benchmark for further automatic predictions            of GO terms using programs similar to LOVEATFIRSTSITE              and PANTHER                                        Conclusions        Annotation of eukaryotic genomes is not a        straightforward process owing to the limitations of the        current geneprediction algorithms However we have made        the annotation process much more rigorous by utilizing a        large set of experimental data manual curation and        defined standards By using a large amount of cDNA        alignment data and a tool facilitating the rapid visual        inspection of evidence for each gene model we were able to        significantly improve the quality of         Drosophila gene annotations We found        that a comprehensive set of curation rules was crucial to        making manual annotation consistent and reliable We also        found that comparison of predicted peptides to        experimentally verified SWISSPROT and TrEMBL sequences was        an important qualityassessment step In future we plan to        make the automated analysis of predicted polypeptides        including identification of their protein domains and        sequence similarities a more integrated part of genomic        sequence annotation Finally by making the annotations        comments and all supporting evidence available to users        we have provided the scientific community with the        resources to assess the quality of each gene model        Our analysis reveals a number of genes that fall outside        the definition of conventional gene models neighboring        genes with overlapping UTRs genes with alternative        transcripts encoding distinct coding regions and        dicistronic transcripts An even larger number of genes        show alternative splicing or are nested within neighboring        genes Currently geneprediction algorithms are unable to        accurately predict such gene models Studies like this one        are a prerequisite to extending current computational        methods to more successfully and specifically predict        eukaryotic gene structures by defining the classes of        features and the requirements for supporting evidence Once        sophisticated computational pipelines can cope with the        full range of complex genomic features we will benefit        from better resources for biological investigation        FlyBase is one of several major model organism databases        with highquality euchromatic sequence charged with        curation of experimental data from the literature Unlike        many other organisms         Drosophila has a genetic history        reaching back to  and an enormous amount of data to        tie to the sequence In this paper we have addressed one        of the first challenges accurately annotating the genomic        sequence by utilizing the extensive resource of        fullinsert         D melanogaster cDNA sequences and        FlyBase gene records containing existing community data        and by manually curating the gene models using defined        methods and controlled vocabularies However there is more        work necessary to tie the annotated genomic sequence and        annotated peptide sequences to further experimental data        from the literature results of largescale analyses for        example microarray expression data and new computational        analyses for example comparative sequence analysis We        believe shared dataexchange formats and ontologies will be        vitally important to curate collate and structure this        huge amount of data in a way that allows researchers to        exploit the information to its full potential                    Materials and methods                  Curation rules          We have attempted to provide documentation for as many          annotation decisions as possible In addition to          providing access to evidence EST and fullinsert cDNA          sequence reads prior sequence submissions BLASTX          homologies and gene prediction data we have developed          and made available a set of annotation rules see            and additional data files and have provided textual          comments to explain atypical or subjective          annotations          The annotation rules promote consistency in the          annotation effort and deal with all aspects of          annotation from assessment of whether a marginal gene          prediction should be the basis for a new gene model to          the annotation of atypical splice sites from the          determination of alternative transcriptional starts and          stops and the designation of translation starts to the          use of comments to flag atypical or questionable          annotations Cases with insufficient atypical or          conflicting data that the rules did not address were left          to the discretion of the annotator in such instances          comments to document the subjective nature of the gene          model were added          Typically at least one annotation was created          containing each site of alternative splicing represented          in the ESTcDNA data For atypical splice junctions a          higher level of supporting data was required see below          Often sites of alternative splicing were supported by          ESTs but not fullinsert cDNAs Since as a matter of          policy we tried to avoid creating partial transcript          models this required that we postulate transcripts          combining for example  and  ESTs corresponding to          different cDNAs In some cases these combinations may          not exist           in vivo  In particularly complex          cases curators did not create every splice form          suggested by the data but commented that the potential          exists for additional splice forms          The rules used were specific for this annotation          effort in particular for the types of data currently          available For example because of the limited amount of           EST data little attempt was made to annotate          alternative transcripts that differ as a result of          multiple polyadenylation sites          Establishment of the annotation rules included the          development of a set of controlled comments that is          comments that are reproducibly phrased and are          consistently used Such controlled comments were used to          confirm atypical gene structures such as the use of          atypical splice sites or overlapping UTRs and to          document the evidence used in subjective cases such as          an unusual gene structure based on a single EST or a gene          model based solely on geneprediction data DGC cDNA          clones that appeared to contradict other evidence were          also flagged most frequently these were not fulllength          or appeared to contain intronic sequences                          Annotation of nonproteincoding genes          To annotate small nonproteincoding RNA genes          previously collected in the FlyBase database we          retrieved sequences for each gene from GenBank             and generated a multipleFASTA dataset Occasionally          sequence was retrieved from the original literature The          FASTA dataset was then aligned to the Release  genome by          Sim alignment MicroRNAs were aligned by BLASTN          analysis a single exact match was found for each of the          microRNAs listed in FlyBase                          Evidence for gene structures                      Gene prediction data            The publicly available version of Genie which does            not utilize EST or BLAST evidence   predicted             genes on the finished sequence GENSCAN            predicted  genes As reported previously               Genie appears to predict fewer false positives            perhaps because it has been trained on             Drosophila sequences whereas            GENSCAN has only been trained on vertebrate datasets              However GENSCAN also shows greater sensitivity            than Genie identifying some real genes that Genie            fails to find To balance the falsepositive and            falsenegative rates of GENSCAN we used an empirical            prediction score as a threshold as done previously              In the absence of other supporting evidence for a            gene we used GENSCAN predictions only when at least            one exon had a score   this is a stringent            threshold as  of the genes in Release  with            fulllength cDNA evidence do not contain any exons            scoring                                  BLASTXTBLASTX sequence similarity data            To detect proteins with significant sequence            similarity we used BLASTX to compare translated            genomic sequence to peptides in other species included            in SWALL    and TBLASTX to compare translated            genomic sequence to virtual translations of the rodent            UniGene set   and insect sequences in dbEST              We also looked for sequence similarities to             Drosophila peptides that had            experimental verification but not to those            representing purely hypothetical or computational gene            models see below Although the number of proteins in            a public database like TrEMBL   has increased            exponentially in the time between the Release             annotation in November  and the Release             annotation in    the increased size of the            protein datasets resulted in a  increase in the            number of fly genes that produce proteins with            similarity to other proteins In March  Adams             et al    reported that              of the  of the Release  genes showed a            match to another protein We now find that              of the Release  proteincoding genes show a match by            BLASTX or TBLASTX with expectation value less than or            equal to   e  However we note that the datasets            we used were fixed before the release of the genomic            sequence of             A gambiae   the only other            dipteran or arthropod with a complete genome            sequence We expect that a higher percentage of             Drosophila proteins will show            sequence similarity to             Anopheles proteins because             A gambiae is more closely            related to             D melanogaster than are the            other available model organisms                                  EST and cDNA alignment data            Prediction of gene models was made more rigorous by            the increased availability of cDNA data However            misleading alignments can be created by the presence of            genomic DNA contaminants cDNA clones containing two            independent cDNAs coligated in the same plasmid vector            chimeras and internal priming of cDNAs during            library synthesis cDNA clones derived from            incompletely processed primary transcripts are not            readily distinguishable from alternative splicing            without experimental verification Moreover cDNA            sequences designated as full length may actually be            truncated approximately  of the  fullinsert            sequences from the BDGP are probably not fulllength               The Sim alignment tool can make mistakes in            determining splice site junctions or completely fail to            align very small exons    indeed a small            number of cases of failure to align microexons were            identified by Stapleton             et al    when they compared            the predicted translation products of cDNAs with those            of Release  gene models However Haas             et al  found estgenome and            other alignment tools were in general not superior to            Sim    Despite these limitations alignment of            complete cDNA sequences is invaluable in detecting            UTRs alternative splicing events detailed exonintron

fullinsert sequences from            the cDNA clones in the DGC and in some cases more            than one DGC clone provided definitive gene models for            alternatively spliced products At the time of            annotation we had access to fullinsert sequencing            reads from  of the  cDNA clones but only            some  of these had been fully assembled Gene            models based on incompletely assembled cDNA clones were            marked incomplete These gene models will be among            the first annotations to be updated            Sequences deposited in public databanks like            GenBankEMBLDDBJ        by             Drosophila researchers provided            definitive evidence for a number of genes For a subset            of wellstudied genes

additional point was assigned for overlap with protein            similarity data The remaining datasets were considered            in the following order and resulted in an additional            one or two points the cDNA and annotation data were            analyzed to determine if any entry in this class            spanned the entire length of the CDS if so an            additional two points were assigned and if not            GenBankEMBLDDBJ and error report entries were            analyzed and if any spanned the length of CDS two            points were assigned if none of these data

visually inspected each            annotation in these classes making comments where            appropriate We checked annotations that overlapped            transposable elements and tRNA genes or appeared            multiple times in the genome with duplicate            identifiers We verified that deleted Release             annotations had no independent evidence in

appropriate note                                Nonconsensus splice sites            All introns within proteincoding genes were            examined for conserved GTAG splice junctions with the            Sequin program    and all instances of            annotations lacking GTAG splice junctions were            inspected and commented upon Splice junctions were            based upon alignment of cDNAEST sequence and in the            absence of such data on gene prediction models Even            for transcript structures based upon EST data the            number of atypical splice junctions is probably an            underestimate The alignment algorithm used Sim            forced intron junctions to occur at GTAG sites            whenever possible even at the expense of a            severalbase mismatch This occasionally resulted in            apparent early translation termination in which case            the annotator checked for a GC donor that would allow            readthrough Other GC splice annotations were based on            information in the literature or GenBankEMBLDDBJ            records With the exception of GTAG junctions we            imposed a higher standard of verification for            unconventional splice annotations sequence data from a            cDNA isolated from the sequenced strain or multiple            consistent ESTs                                SWISSPROTTrEMBL validation of the models            The SWISSPROT and TrEMBL protein databases              were used to validate the integrity of the annotations            and to track consistency with previously published            data The SWISSPROT Protein Knowledgebase   is a            curated protein sequence database that provides a high            level of annotation a minimal level of redundancy and            high level of integration with other databases The            TrEMBL database   contains the translations of all            CDS present in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database               which are not yet integrated into SWISSPROT              A nonredundant set of SWISSPROT and TrEMBL             Drosophila sequences was created            and sequences representing purely hypothetical or            computational gene models those corresponding to CG            BG or EG genes in FlyBase were excluded The PEPQC            program   compared the resulting collection of                         D melanogaster sequences            SPTRreal to the annotated peptides using BLASTP              Each gene was placed into one of four validation            categories Perfect match to SPTRreal annotated            peptide of identical length with  sequence            identity Single AA substitutions annotated peptide            of identical length with   sequence identity            Significant mismatch annotated peptide and SPTRreal            entry do not align over their entire length but do            contain aligned spans of  residues or  peptide            length with at least  sequence identity or Poor            match poor or no BLAST hits For the first two            categories the SPTRreal peptide was allowed to match a            portion of the annotated peptide if it was designated            as a fragment of the full peptide sequence  or             of SPTRreal genes are designated with this            tag            In Release  about  of all genes with a cognate            in SPTRreal are in the Perfect match and Single AA            substitution categories  out of  Curators            examined every gene marked Single AA substitutions            Significant mismatch or Poor match In some cases            annotation errors were detected and gene models were            modified to produce a translation matching the SPTRreal            sequence For example curators used the PEPQC output            to change translation start sites to the experimentally            reported position where appropriate In other cases            discrepancies may be due to strain polymorphisms            errors in the reported DNA sequence on which the            SPTRreal entries were based or undetected errors in            either the Release  annotation or sequence Given the            high quality of the underlying Release  genomic            sequence we believe that in many cases the Release             annotations are more accurate than the SPTRreal            sequences            The improvement over the Release  annotations is            evident The combined number of Perfect match and            Single AA substitution annotations has increased by             from  in Release  to  in Release             while the combined number of Significant mismatch and            Poor match annotations has decreased by   in            Release  versus  in Release  Over the past two            years SWISSPROT has incorporated sequences from            Releases  and  of the genomic annotations into the            curated protein sequences E Whitfield personal            communication Therefore while the overall quality of            the sequences in SWISSPROT has almost certainly            increased during this time it is still worth asking            the question  how well do the Release  annotations            match SWISSPROT sequences deposited before the initial            genome annotations This question was answered for the            Release  annotations using a dataset of             polypeptide sequences created in SWISSPROT before             prior to the publication of the annotated Release             sequence   That group found that  or  of            this SWISSPROT set had an annotated peptide of            identical length with at least  amino acid identity            A J Gentles personal communication Performing the            same analysis using the Release  annotations we find            that  or  of the peptides in the same            SWISSPROT dataset match with  identity This             increase in the number of matching polypeptides most            likely is a reflection of the improvement in the            quality of the annotations But what about the  of            cases that show significant mismatch between Release             and SWISSPROT We have examined these cases and            believe that the large majority of these remaining            discrepancies are not due to mistakes in our            annotation but due to strain polymorphisms as well as            errors in the sequence underlying the SWISSPROT            entries created before  If this were indeed the            case then the analysis of Karlin             et al    would have grossly            overestimated the error rate in the Release
