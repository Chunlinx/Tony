        well do you have any pets   yes i do i have a dog named Grisly whos a ten year old uh mixed breed between Golden Retriever Afghan Hound and Chow and i have a pair of box turtles   oh oh i used to have box turtles um well years ago when i was growing up i     yeah   i really liked them um   oh yeah i do too Lucky and Spot thats their names and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room and my dog thinks hes a mother turtle and always has his nose all around my turtle box   oh     so do you have any pets now   yes um we have one dog a Bichon Frise um our friends in Houston bred the dogs i had never heard of them   no i havent either   theyre um theyre all white and theyre small and um and fluffy they dont shed i guess they are distantly related to a poodle but theyre not very well known in this country and theyre not um high strung or over bred   oh and how big do they get   um ours is uh on the small end and shes about ten pounds and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds   oh thats interesting   and they love people um and kids and that was something we were looking for um our our love is Golden Retrievers and thats what we had intended to get in Houston but we had a small yard and a pool and knowing how they love to dig and love the water um and we thought that was kind of a tough climate   yes the water yes yeah   so uh we ended up getting this and uh my son would rather have a Golden Retriever though i think  now he wants a   oh   a good size dog   uhhuh well weve got a good size dog and we were considering getting a puppy a small house lap top dog for him because he likes other animals and for me because we used to have a miniature Dachshund and i miss having a little one   oh yeah   you know around the kind you have sounds very interesting though   what they really are um theyre really sweet dogs weve uh we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of um the family that had them and and bred them they had five litters of puppies and and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood because um   oh uhhuh and how do you spell that breed   they its B I C H O N F R I S E   F R I S E and how do you pronounce that   Bichon Frise   okay im writing it out phonetically   yeah theyre uh and they dont shed so theyre theyre good dogs for people with with allergies and they love people i mean theyre   yes do they bark a lot   um no not really ours um ours barks more than uh than some because she spent a lot of time at our friends house we used to swap back and forth dogs that they have three dogs they had a Cockapoo and and two Bichons um   uhhuh   and she didnt bark at all until she spent time there and and um   oh   now its funny shes shes a good watch dog i mean if theres   uhhuh   um shell bark that way but she also talk a lot she   yes   um has a definite personality and so if were leaving her she barks at us because she doesnt want to be left um   oh does she ever mess in the house   no no and theyre um theyre very smart dogs the circuses in Europe used to use them um for the acts they uh   oh   oh theyll dance on their hind legs each   uhhuh oh gee   um  but theyre very easy to train and   uhhuh and about how much are they   well they range id noticed up here theyre a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper they run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars i think which i thought was a lot   and how about the and how about the person in uh Houston   well shes no longer breeding them but um because her dogs um   oh   the the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter and uh the one male that she used had a tooth problem   uhhuh   and so she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem and did them strictly as um pets you know they werent werent show quality   oh yes just pets yes thats what wed rather have is just a pet instead of we used to show Saint Bernards when i was a little girl we did that every weekend   right oh but yeah it takes a lot of time um   yes and its very expensive   yeah um but she might have some contacts here i know originally i know that the dogs grandmother um was from Plano   oh thats where i live   oh thats where i live too   yeah im at Coit and Legacy
