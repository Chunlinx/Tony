                actually to tell you the truth i think uh jury selection is a uh prime uh discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on uh uh finding of uh guilt   hm i certainly cant argue with that definitely does need some improvements uh and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to     yeah i think theres a limit on that the uh the uh peremptory challenges are limited to i dont know how many but you can   i think its its four or five i cant remember which i was on a jury trial last year only i got kicked out as uh the last selection that the uh defense got   hm yeah i it seems to me im always challenged peremptorily also when i go to these things i think i have a severe demeanor or something   hm  that uh   uh but typically you know basically uh typically uh everyone gets involved in uh the jury process and i suppose an elitist might say well you really want someone whos well educated to be able to to winnow the facts from the from the prejudice   right but it still has to be a group of your peers   right   see   so   so if its your peers and youre not educated   so if youre a nincompoop on trial youd youd have to have nincompoops to uh   then you want you want a nincompoop jury because theyll sympathize with you a bit   hm   as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them so thats why the defense is there picking through them whereas at the same time the uh the prosecutors sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him uh a guilty verdict if the facts warrant   umhum   so uh i think the jury selection process is pretty neat but i dont think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment   hm   afterwards i think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have i mean youre talking about the persons already been found guilty   umhum umhum   right and many times ive seen on trials they have on TV the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever but i think that it should be up to the judge and the uh lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be   hm   maybe just the judge because theyre the people who know what the system is and what its all about and believe in the system   umhum hm umhum   uh and i think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure   well i suppose you may be right on that   as opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure also may be a more consistent sentencing procedure   as a matter of fact ive heard that ive heard that some of the information uh is prevented from reaching the jury like uh mitigating circumstances or or preceding uh criminal record or things of this nature that   well preceding criminal record according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime but when it comes to uh sentencing for punishment of course if the persons never done anything bad before according to the judicial system then theyre going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side and the jurys supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury   oh is it oh i didnt realize that okay   at least in California theyre supposed to be not during the trial during the trial as to whether theyre guilty or not has nothing to do with their background   right   but when it comes to what kind of sentence youre going to lay down i think that uh that they should   umhum   i dont i dont know that they always have because i never sat all the way through a jury trial they get too boring   umhum so youre what youre saying is if if this is the second offense then you execute them   well if its a second offense the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense because obviously the rehabilitation process did not work the first time   umhum   so you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process thatll hopefully work better uh when it comes down to things like alternative sentencing im all for that for uh small crimes infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things   what about uh white collar crimes like uh theft of trade secrets   i think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are   oh really   yeah   like what   well uh say embezzlement right you get a guy down the street   hm   who comes up uh carrying a knife
