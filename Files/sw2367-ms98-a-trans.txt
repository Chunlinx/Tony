          all right well what kind of uh restaurants what type restaurants you like to go to   um casual ones but with class you know not too fancy but uh i i wont go to a fast food place   uhhuh   i really cant stand those uh   yeah um do you like i mean what is it about uh the the kind of restaurants you go to that you like i mean what makes you like i said what makes you want come back   um quality of the food   is it well see uh qualities one thing but to me the uh not necessarily just the friendliness of the service but the service is real important   yeah   to me uh i will go back to a place where uh i smile during the meal you know and just not just because of the food but i mean because either the waiter or the waitresses   yeah you had a good time there   yeah exactly uh thats real important to me i i cant stand going to a stuffy place i mean its just thats not me um in your you know like you said fast food restaurants arent any good either   yeah uhhuh   but uh you know i dont necessarily uh you know theres a place here uh its um its good its a barbecue place and its uh you know you go through a line and and get your stuff   okay   but they make it fun you know they they they the people behind the counter are are laughing and joking with you all the time and i you know thats one reason why i like to go back   um yeah yeah   you know the food is excellent obviously that that is like i said that is important   yeah   but um you know if i dont know that i would go back as often if it wasnt for the idea that i have fun there   yeah thats true theres some places though that i go to they dont have the best service or theyre not the friendliest but ill ill tolerate it just because i know thats the kind of food i want to eat   uhhuh   and theres other places but like you said the the food doesnt matter its you have such a good time there   have you ever gone to like dinner theaters or or uh things like that   yeah i have not in not in a good while but   well see im uh ive been to dinner theaters but the every time i go its you know on the nonmeal show type you know type thing so ive its been a while since ive been to one uh   just to see the show just to see the show right   yeah yeah um normally its comedy i i enjoy comedy although theres one that im im really looking forward to going to in the next couple of weeks its a i just found out that well im sure theyve theyve had them for a along time but its uh   uhhuh   its like a mystery uh theater uh that you you know you eat dinner and all through dinner theyre theyre doing this act and they they get supposedly get the audience involved in it and everything and that that sounds like that would be hilarious you know   um um yeah that sounds pretty wild   cause because i love watching mysteries on on TV anyway and i love figuring them out before they do you know   yeah   of course thats probably a lot easier on TV to figure it out than it is in other things because TV they have a tendency to do a lot of things uh that arent you know what i mean um predictable exactly but i mean you know the the dinner a dinner theater like this ought to be just wild i dont know   predictable yeah yeah that does sound like a pretty neat idea   yeah so um i mean is there anything else about a restaurant that would make you go back though   well theres this uh theres this type kind of restaurant called a brew pub are you familiar with those   no hadnt heard of them   where they they brew their own beer there   oh yeah   yeah and theres i used to live in Colorado and there was a lot of them there and theres actually theres two in the Raleigh area   uhhuh   and uh im a im a home brewer myself so i just am envious of these people and you go there  and a couple you have gone to you can order like a sampler   uhhuh   and and while youre eating your meal and usually their food is good too they they bring out six different kinds of beer that they brewed on the premises and you just test its like uh beer tasting thing while youre eating your meal and its really neat   um yeah that sounds kind of neat uh is location at all important to you like you know how far it is from your house or whatever   um yeah i usually dont  go somewhere thats too far away   well yeah i i guess   but uh   yeah i i think my favorite restaurant is always been the one closest  you know the closest as long as its it meets the minimum criteria you know of good food   yeah yeah well i guess for like lunch places thats really important because you usually that much time or or whatever   um no kidding   working for TI thats pretty important   oh so thats why were getting all these Dallas people thats what i figured but   yeah yeah     i didnt i dont want to assume that thats what i figured no im a college im a university student so uh   so yeah that oh okay   that also has a has a little bit of bearing on what restaurant choices you have when youre flat broke all the time   oh yeah money does yeah i can see that so   but uh im going to be starting working full time this summer so maybe maybe my restaurants will change   so you graduating are graduating or yeah well maybe i dont know id uh i really havent changed that much since i was in school in school um of course you know im not sure you ever get out of school to tell you the truth and uh   yeah   depending on what industry you get into or whatever like uh you know TI being electronics uh you never get out of school so you know   umhum no well actually i graduated with a BS in double E in in eighty eight  and ive been in school ever since then       i took one semester off and and ive been taking a class at least one class every semester   yeah well like i said though my my change my taste in in food really hadnt changed all that much in in restaurants i mean a little bit yeah uh especially in you know i didnt have the money to go to these dinner theaters and stuff before   uhhuh yeah right   whereas i you know i have gone to a couple of these things before you know lately and you know its like i said i missed the dinner dinner part of it but ive gone to the theater   uhhuh yeah   uh but i you know like i said thats thats probably so price really i guess does have a lot to do with it i hadnt even really considered that before   um ive become a lot more health conscious and thats why i stopped eating fast food and places like that   um yeah yeah well thats probably true to so   i used to love hamburger joints and i dont go to them i dont eat hamburgers anymore but   uhhuh   well unfortunately im not as good about that as you are i still go every once one in awhile     i used to just i i used be a connoisseur of hamburger places         Mikes Grill thats the place to go for the best burger     yeah well its like i said you know the different there are different reasons for different things like that and you know hey youre right health is one thing that just   yeah now i go for the best place to get uh tofu or whatever not quite that bad but uh   i was wondering yeah       well all right well i think that should just about do it   yeah good talking to you well see you later byebye   yeah take care uhhuh bye
