                okay what kind of  do you have children   okay yeah we have one thats seventeen one thats fifteen and one thats just now six   oh okay   and we had kind of a hard time finding someplace that would we could put Michaels because his birthday is the first of September and he was going to school at five   umhum oh   so he started the first grade when he was five or started   uhhuh   yeah first grade when he was five years old   and you had trouble finding somewhere for him to be before he was five   yeah so we could you know we tried to find him someplace where he could learn something   right   and it was uh   that   mediocore mediocre expensive it wasnt really that expensive but its really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something   uhhuh to learn something and thats i mean thats  even not only toddlers but you know even your older children   yeah   its hard to find anywhere there really going to learn something and then yeah you do have to pay you know if you the better the place the more youre going to pay   yeah well yeah but parents pay when they stay home with them anyway   true very true if   you know my my wife works so   umhum   it costs us more for her to stay home more than it does for him to go to the babysitter so   umhum if i had any children i would uh i hope that ill be in a position to stay home with my child because   okay   im not real uh uh trusting  of a lot of people   yeah see i dont know   uh especially today people i work in the news business and i just see different things all the time      yeah   and people are just crazy these days theyre crazy   and   and  and i dont you know it takes me a takes me a long time to just trust someone as a friend much less to you know trust someone with my with my child   yeah well see we took our time and we checked it out and we found a preschool for him   uhhuh uhhuh   and it you know through other folks where i where i work i work at TI   uhhuh   so through other folks where we worked we found a nice preschool it was actually at a licensed preschool you know we   umhum   had those requirements   hum   so   i guess thats the best way you know to get recommendations from your friends or family members   yeah you know i well that and you know i dont think i would have left him anywhere that would i would have stayed home with him first   umhum   before i left him somewhere that you know they still have unlicensed babysitters running around up here and   hum   you know i just i i dont think id take that chance   umhum   you know i think its out of sight or out of mind for less than   yeah yeah i mean you have to be you have to be sure that these people   for more than a minute or so   i mean not that theyre going to abuse your child or anything but you just have to be sure that theyre going to be watching them you know that they wouldnt let them drink something or   but you never know yeah   you know eat something off the floor you know just simple things that can be harmful   yeah but you you know as far as brittle as child abuse is these days you never know   umhum   you dont know who you can trust and who you cant   umhum and you hear so much you know on the news about   you know   uh child care places and also um senior care facilities you know and you hear abuse yeah   yeah senior care is getting real bad   and so you just you just dont know and you almost want to you know spend a couple of weeks with in class with your child just to see how it is or something   yeah   but   so you have no children at all huh   no i dont huhuh   gee   no im   do you miss that part in your life or   uh no im only im twenty three   yeah   so i still have a little bit of time um its just not in the cards for me right now im trying to get my career going   yeah yeah i imagine yeah working in the news production anyway back to the subject   and uh yeah yeah   we should have discussed this earlier but anyway its tough it really is its hard to find     umhum umhum   good child care and its hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that hes going to be fine all day long   uhhuh umhum and you brought up a good point you know about learning you just dont want a babysitter you you would hope that maybe theyd come home and know some of their ABCs or something you know get them   and yeah you know and hes hes doing real well it it it has paid off for him hes in first grade now and hes you know got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level   umhum umhum huh   so you know those early ages when he would you know when his mom and dad are at work and hes actually in child care in a preschool not   yes umhum   just child care you know we could have sent him to anybody you know theres a lot people at work that would have babysat him but   right umhum   sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something has paid off not only for us his his attitude is i think a little bit   right umhum   tall for a six year old and you know but his   did you take this same uh route with your other two children   um they they were outside my marriage so   okay   i dont know   umhum   i would say no but   i was wondering how   you know all my children excel theyre theyre really good and i guess no he learns from the older boys too but   umhum umhum right and it helps that he has older brothers you know um just to have role models and things like that   yeah yeah yeah seeing like uh in one way were kind of lucky because theyre all boys but in another way were not so lucky because we dont have another woman in the house for my wife to share but   umhum umhum   so we faced that too but   hum   he learns quite a bit he learned quite a bit from not only from nursery school but he learned quite a bit from the older boys and   umhum   you know hes excelled and its paying off for him it really is hes   thats excellent   he is pretty smart sometimes hes a little bit smart mouthed but he is smart you know yeah   umhum well what kid isnt these days so   but i think its important i think its really nice to know that you can find someplace i dont know you know how it is down there in Waco but in Lubbock we have a few that you can   umhum   send your children to and they can actually learn something instead of just being babysat   umhum do they have any kind of program like at TI or wherever your wife works   and   um some any kind of day care   no not any huhuh we just   hum because i know theyre theyre putting that into a lot of uh corporations now   yeah theyre trying to the federal government is trying to insist on that too so   right so maybe thatll be an option for   no we dont yet well it would be nice you know there   but then i i foresee that being just a babysitting thing not much learning but you know   yeah theres not well   kind of somebody to just watch your kid while your at work   you know where where we sent Michael the first few years was there was different teachers all the time you know some girls were there in the morning and then some substitute teachers in the afternoon and they actually taught him something instead of just watching him all day   hum umhum right   you know and then he they had a group of kids and they put on skits and they put on plays and they did the Halloween thing and the Valentines Day things   um umhum   and its you know it was important to us so we you know we took a good look at it and made sure it was going to go that way   hum do you think it would have been better for him to have um maybe one continuous teacher somebody to that he could   um   uh get attached to or is it better the other way with a lot of different   no because i think you know as a child growing up i think is a task that belongs to his parents   uhhuh   i dont think he needed to be attached to too even though he did   umhum   you know he attached himself to a couple of those but   right   i think his attachments at home and you know he gets the idea of what school is for and uh you know i have different teachers here and this person can teach me one thing and this person teach teach me another and   hum   no so i i i really cant say that it would be its important for him to attach himself to anybody   right um umhum   he did well you it it with another child i cant say that   right   because i dont have that experience   yeah each child is individual as for as learning and things   yeah see but i dont have that experience so i cant say that you know he did well so   umhum   i dont think we made too many mistakes   right well it sounds good sounds like hes doing real well   we tried hard yeah hes doing real well   umhum well good   and he learned from it so and that was the most important thing that we wanted was for him to learn not just to sit there and be babysat all day you know babysat sounds to me like well youre here i guess ill watch you when i get time you know maybe ill clean my house maybe ill cook you lunch maybe i wont   umhum umhum umhum   you know and   and theyll probably sit him in front of the television   yeah yeah   you know while they do other things yeah   yeah and i dont you know i dont allow that when hes at home so   umhum   but we had a good experience and we really did well   yeah well thats good thats good   so and he didnt he served better than we did you know he gained he actually gained from it you know sure we gained from it because we were allowed to continue our employment and   uhhuh uhhuh   continue our family but i think in the long run he gained from it just being somewhere where we learned something instead of just sitting around watching TV and playing all day   thats great right right   and its important   thats probably what ill try and look for whenever i do have my children i dont know when that will be but um   yeah yeah   you know just really look into it will it will take me a long time to find somewhere im sure   yeah well   just because i i just want to be i want to be so positive that you know my children are okay   yeah   as well as the other children in the center you know   well you know his his mom didnt go back to work till you know he was six months old   umhum   and we just didnt want to dump him somewhere and make him feel like he wasnt wanted   umhum exactly   and we wanted his center of attention at home but   umhum   we did what we could and it it worked out real well im glad we were so careful   its difficulties but its its a lot more difficulties these days because you have both parents working a lot of times and so you have to find day care whereas you know here   oh yeah you know well it most of the time now its a necessity you cant afford   umhum umhum   so you know im not making seventy or thirty eighty thousand dollars a year so   umhum thats right   its pretty tough   so child cares a necessity whereas years ago you know the husband basically worked and the wife basically stayed home   yeah and mom  mom was allowed to stay home and there was   umhum   a few families outside of that where dad stayed home and mom worked but not very many that i know of when i was growing up   umhum   and you know im forty now but   umhum   i know when i was a kid mom was always at home   right   so we didnt   i think that has a lot to do with just just all children how they learn and things just because the basic family is is breaking you know the basic family is not there anymore   yeah it is yeah it is ill agree with that it is its its not there   umhum   you know   i think that plays a big part in in a childs learning and you know what they can and cannot do in child care   yeah   i would think
