                            Coronary heart disease CHD is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in        developed countries and identifying and treating patients with high cholesterol has an        essential role in the prevention of CHD Therapeutic lifestyle changes are important for        general reduction of risk overall but patients who are more likely to develop CHD or who        have high cholesterol should be treated with statins Statins inhibit HMGCoA reductasea        key enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway        Although we know that not all patients who may benefit from statins receive treatment        there is limited information on how patients are treated according to their estimated risk        of developing CHD Patients may be classified as at low medium or high risk of developing        CHD according to the presence of CHD some other medical conditions for example        diabetes and major risk factors including cholesterol level smoking lifestyle and        family history Jun Ma and colleagues analyzed data from the National Ambulatory Medical        Care Survey and the outpatient department component of the National Hospital Ambulatory        Medical Care Survey to identify changes in treatment from  to  and to identify        current clinical practice These surveys have been validated against other data sources        and used in past research on cholesterol management        The researchers found that between  and  the use of statins increased nearly        fold from  to  in ambulatory visits by patients with high cholesterol but then        declined to  in  Overall the use of statins was three times more likely in         and  than in  and  Patients at high risk of CHD were more likely to use        statins than other patients However among patients whose visit had a reported high        cholesterol only  of patient visits at high risk of CHD and  of those at moderate        risk were prescribed statins in  well below the recommendations of current guidelines        Less than half the patient visits that arguably represent optimal opportunities for        counseling services received counseling about how they might change their lifestyle The        study also showed inequities in use of statins for patients with different social and        clinical characteristics with lower usage in younger patients females AfricanAmericans        and patients cared for by doctors who are not cardiologists        As the authors declare the study was funded by a maker of one of the statins but the        information acquired is of general interest Persistent gaps in statin therapy suggest a        need for improved identification of patients who may develop CHD and treatment with        statins when indicated the authors say A particular focus should be patients who are at        risk of developing CHD Education should be aimed at improving the practice of        physiciansabove all those who are not heart specialistsso that they adhere to        evidencebased medicine and published guidelines for cardiovascular risk reduction In an        accompanying Perspective DOI journalpmed Fiona Turnbull from the        George Institute for International Health says that physicians need to move away from        making treatment decisions based on single risk factors and instead use an approach based        on absolute risk An understanding of the concept of absolute riskthe probability of a        patient developing a cardiovascular event over a specified time periodis crucial she        says
