                            How do we relate human thought processes to measurable events in the brain Mental        chronometry which has origins that date back more than a century seeks to measure the        time course of mental operations in the human nervous system  From the late s until         the field was built almost entirely around a single method measuring and comparing        peoples reaction times during simple cognitive tasks As far back as  Franciscus        Donders  subtracted the time taken to make a single response to an unvarying        stimuluswhat he called an instructed reflexfrom the time it took to make the same        response to one of two events obtaining the time required to discriminate between the two        stimuli Further he subtracted the time to discriminate two stimuli from a situation in        which there were also two possible responses in order to obtain the time required for        choice        In the s studies of reaction time were combined with the thendeveloping        mathematical theory of information  to address issues such as the maximum transmission        rate of the human nervous system  and how coding in the brain of stimuli and their        responses could influence these limits  These studies revealed that reaction time alone        was not sufficient to elucidate the exact processes by which the brain achieved the human        ability to process information However when combined with other methods the latency of        responding can help connect brain studies to the behavior of humans in real situations        Recording the average eventrelated electrical potentials from scalp electrodes became a        research tool in the s with the advent of analog and then digital computers to        accomplish the recording and averaging It became clear that components of the        eventrelated potential could be systematically related to sensory and motor stages of        information processing For instance a visual stimulus was found to evoke a shortlatency        scalp response from the primary visual cortex at about  milliseconds followed by        positive and negative voltage changes in neighboring visual areas Similarly scalp        recorded potentials from the frontal cortex could be recorded in relation to motor        activity It was now possible to observe some of the sensory and motor stages that were        inferred from Donderss subtractive method see  for a review        Saul Sternberg  developed a muchimproved method for dividing reaction time into        successive or serial stages called the additive factors method Subjects were asked to        determine whether or not a probe digit had been present in a just previously presented        series of digits Sternberg argued that the time to complete the task could be divided into        a sensory stage dependent on stimulus parameters such as the intensity or clarity of the        probe a comparison stage dependent only on the number of items in memory and a response        stage that reflected the difficulty of the specified response Factors that influenced one        stage eg stimulus intensity would be additive with those that influenced another stage        eg motor output With this simple framework it was now possible to determine at which        stages a new factor eg nicotine sleep deprivation or Parkinsons disease had its        influence        In the s the advent of microelectrode recordings of single neurons from        anesthetized monkeys allowed for an even finer resolution of neurophysiological processes        and seemed to provide support for the view that the brain does indeed process information        in serial stages Hubel and Wiesel  argued that successive levels of the visual system        could be seen as accomplishing successive analyses of input The microelectrode strategy        was quickly adopted to alert animals making it apparent that higher level brain areas        involved in operations upon input might feedback their influences on earlier processing        stages  These control systems often called attention posed something of a problem        for completely serial views of information processing However they also provided evidence        of localized brain areas within the parietal lobe of the monkey that could be        systematically related to processing operations involved in attentionwhich were then being        investigated by mental chronometry in patients with parietal and other lesions         In the late s neuroimaging experiments made possible the examination of activity in        localized brain areas first through the use of injected radionuclides detected by positron        emission tomography PET  and later through the use of an externally imposed magnetic        field in functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI  Over the last ten years fMRI        has improved in spatial and temporal resolution and can now provide evidence of quite        specific brain areas in the millimeter range that are involved in cognitive tasks Most        studies have shown a small number of widely distributed brain areas that must be        orchestrated to carry out a cognitive task Although as in all sciences there are        disagreements the convergence of results in areas of attention and language seem to me        particularly impressive        When the fMRI method for localization is brought together with methods that can        accurately measure timing of the same activity ie electrical or magnetic eventrelated        potentials they can provide considerable insight into the nature of thought Consider the        simple task of deciding whether a presented digit is above or below five  Dehaene        argued that the task could be divided into four stages The first involves obtaining the        identity of the probe input encoding the second making a comparison against the stored        representation of the digit five the third selecting a response and lastly checking the        output for error According to additive factor theory a variable that effects overall        reaction time by varying the time to complete one stage will be additive with the effects        of variables that affect other stages The input or encoding stage was varied by using        either Arabic or spelled digits eg  or three The comparison stage was varied by        comparing digits close to five eg six with those far from five eg nine The        response stage was varied by specifying a response from either the dominant or nondominant        hand and error monitoring was examined by comparing error with correct trials Each of        these variables influenced only the appropriate stage and was additive in its effect with        each of the other variables see Figure         Moreover scalprecorded eventrelated potentials showed a separate scalp distribution        and latency for each variable  Subsequent fMRI data has confirmed and increased the        precision of the anatomy proposed for each of these stages        Of course not all human activities involve a set of exhaustive and independent serial        stages that can be shown to add up to the overall reaction time While tasks like the        number comparison discussed above can be usefully divided into stages some components may        deal with simultaneous operations and may be limited only by a total capacity of central        mechanisms We know that many situations involve parallel processing and feedback loops at        many levels Sternberg has attempted to apply a modified version of additive factor theory        to brain systems using neuroimaging that allows for some of these possibilities                Laboratory studies often use the simultaneous execution of two different tasks dual        tasks to simulate the more realistic situations where humans timeshare activities In        this issue of         PLoS Biology  Sigman and Dehaene  provide a model that further        extends the additive factor logic to the dual task situation They propose that for tasks        that can be broken down into three consecutive stagesperception decision based on noisy        integration of evidence and responsethe perceptual and motor stages can operate both        simultaneously with and independently of stages of another task and are thus easily        amenable to additive factor analysis The decision stage however appears to represent a        kind of cognitive bottleneck for which the reaction times of the two tasks become        interdependent The model adds considerably to the range of situations to which an additive        factor approach can be applied allowing investigators to seek more information about how        new variables influence hidden processing stages        Many cognitive and emotional tasks studied with neuroimaging have implicated a small        number of brain areas that are consistently active Mental chronometry plays a role in        suggesting the cognitive operations that each of these areas performs and how they are        organized in real time The toolkit of new techniques provides the basis for further tests        to evaluate whether a chronometric model reveals a crucial set of connected computations        circuit for carrying out the task For example using a magnetic pulse delivered outside        the skull it is now possible to induce a reversible lesion at the time of a particular        computation to determine whether the specific computation assigned to a given area is truly        needed to carry out the task Studies using diffusion tensor imaging can examine whether        there are largescale connections between neural areas posited by a particular model In        describing the links between brain and behavior mental chronometry is still a cornerstone        that binds psychology to the techniques of neuroscience
