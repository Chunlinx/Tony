                                 Los Angeles Times Publisher Mark Willes            Newspapers are always dyingand someone is always killing them Radio was supposed to bury them So wastelevision So was their aging readership So was USA Today  So was theInternet            Thelatest murderer the corporate bean counter He breaches the Chinese Wallbetween business and editorial cares more about the stock price than about thefrontpage lead favors stories that focus groups want to read and talksconstantly about product To hear critics tell it Times Mirror CEO MarkWilles who just named himself publisher of the Los Angeles Times  is ofthat ilk The greatest newspaper of the West is now being run by a man whosenewspaper experience totals two years much of it spent closing papers and whopassed the bulk of his career as an executive of General Mills abreakfastcereal company or rather a breakfastcereal company forchrissakes             Virtually every newspaper in the country has married someeditorial and business functions but Willes would go further Rather thanlimiting businesseditorial contact to the top of the masthead he proposes tohave each section of the Times sports business etc operate as amore or less autonomous unit Each will have its own minipublisher who willset profitability goals and consult with editors on general content thoughnot Willes insists on specific stories Media critics are aghast TheWall Street Journal calls it a revolution in the newspaperbusiness            Willes isalso pushing hero stories and civic journalism the kind of pandering toreaders that infuriates editors He suggests that the Times introducenew sections aimed at Hispanic and female readers Times staffers gripethat such sections would only ghettoize minority readers Shelby Coffey theTimes  editor of nine years quit last week amid speculation that hecouldnt stomach Willes changes            The newspaper business has always beenromantic and few papers have been more romantic than the Times  Formost of its life it was a rightwing rag that rooted unapologetically forRepublican politicians and local businessmen Then in  Otis Chandler thesurfing antiquecarcollecting scion of the Chandler family which owns mostof Times Mirror took over as publisher During the next two decades Chandlerand his editors transformed the Times into one of the best papers in thecountry They hired talented writers by the score ran the longest stories inthe industry and won Pulitzer after Pulitzer The Times was profligateeditorially bold and profitable Otis Chandlers Times like theSulzbergers New York Times  the Grahams Washington Post  andall great newspaperswas as much grand adventure as business            But OtisChandler retired the Times lost  subscribers the stock wentsouth and Chandlers more conservative relatives demanded higher profits Theera of newspaper romance slipped away in Los Angeles as it did everywhereelse Willes seems to embody the capitalist rationalism that has replaced itA Utah native he first made a name for himself in the late s as aconservative economist touting rational expectations theory long before itbecame fashionable In  at age  he became the youngest president of aFederal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis In  he jumped to General Millswhere he eventually served as president chief operating officer and vicechairman General Mills his critics note is a company where marketing ratherthan content is king            Two years ago the Chandler family picked him to run theirbillionbutstillsickly media company In addition to its flagshipTimes  Times Mirror owns half a dozen other newspapers including theHartford Courant  the Baltimore Sun  and Newsday  severalmagazines and medical and legal publishers Within weeks Willes had madehimself one of the most detested men in journalism In a now infamousinterview he compared newspapers to cereal Then he shuttered the venerableBaltimore Evening Sun and New York Newsday  the much admiredmuch unread much unprofitable downtown sister to Newsday  He also fired members of the Times editorial staff The paper known as thevelvet coffin because of its high pay and cushy working conditions had notlaid off reporters for decades Predictably Willes was nicknamed CerealKiller and Capn Crunch            WallStreet loved what the newsroom loathed Times Mirrors costs plummeted Profitssoared The stock has tripled from  when Willes arrived to nearly todaythe best performance of any big media company Publishing analysts saythat Times Mirror is now one of the healthiest firms in the industry TheChandler family has profited from the companys rising dividends and stockprice            Timesphiles do have some reason to worry aboutWilles as publisher The idea of having ad salesmen and minipublishers helpplan editorial sections is terrifying to anyone whos ever met an adsalesman Heroic and civic journalism do often degenerate into idioticrahrah cheerleading A push for shorter storiesalso said to be in theworksmay well vanquish the elegant comprehensive OK longwinded piecesfor which the paper is famous Well just have to be famous for somethingelse snaps one Times vet            But thereis a more fruitful way to look at Willes He is the first highprofilenewspaper man in a long time who actually believes in newspapers Newspaperprofits may be at record highs but the newspaper Zeitgeist is gloomyCirculation has barely risen since World War II and its been falling for fiveyears Newspaper reporters increasingly feel themselvesirrelevantmarginalized by TV news and the Internet ignored by a youngergeneration of nonreaders            Willes is an optimist Hes a proselytizer of newspapersAccording to those who know him he has learned why newspapers are a publictrust since his unfortunate cereal interview He has forsworn cerealanalogies Other papers are shrinking content Willes wants to add sectionsand features Other papers fear controversy he proposes newspaper crusadesHis ideas may be terriblesome of them certainly are terriblebut atleast they are new            Willes boldest goal toraise the Times circulation from  million to  million No one thinkshe can do it Industry analyst John Morton says it would be a miracle if hepulled it off But everyone wants him to try because only new readers willsave the industry in the long run Willes recently halved the price of theTimes to  cents to reach nonsubscribers Hes launched a huge adcampaign The Times added  readers last year more than anynewspaper in the countryand about the same number the New York Timeslost            To add half a millionreaders or even half that number Willes will need to steal subscribers fromthe  other newspapers in the Los Angeles area including the Orange CountyRegister and the Los Angeles Daily News  This raises an appetizingprospect The Daily News is up for sale Rupert Murdoch is rumored to beinterested in buying it and turning it into a West Coast version of the NewYork Post  A circulationhungry Willes vs the rapacious Murdoch Thatsjust the kind of fight the American newspaper industry needs
