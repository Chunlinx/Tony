                                 Sympathy for Lamar            One of the worst features of American politics is the way we treat decentpeople who fail to win elections Examples include Michael Dukakis after and yes George HW Bush after             Now the press is starting to administer this public shaming in advance Theguy on the receiving end this week is Lamar Alexander widely depicted as awounded horse awaiting his coup de grace in the Ames straw poll onSaturday Reporters have been flocking to Alexanders campaign like crows toroadkill Recent articles in the New Republic  the Washington Post  and the New York Timesmilk the Alexander deathwatch for pathos Despite six years of campaigningIowans dont know who he is Hes broke He cant get the airconditioning inhis car to work The collective message What a pathetic loser            I myself had some harsh words about Lamar during the  campaign I didntlike the way he sold out his own legacy of decent moderate Republicanism foran ersatz antigovernment populism But since Newt Gingrich went the way ofall political flesh Lamar has returned to his sounder instincts This year hehas been espousing the kinds of centrist positions he took when he served as avery fine governor of Tennessee and later as secretary of education On theenvironment Alexander calls himself a Teddy Roosevelt Republican who advocatesspending more on National Parks On education he has backed away from theconservative panacea of vouchers and focused on the more realistic reform ofcharter schools Alexander is short on novelty and excitement but long onintelligence and dedication as his six years of futile campaigning in Iowa andNew Hampshire show He flopped this time but not because of any defect incharacter            Assuming Alexanders campaign does come to an end next week as predicted wemust ask why it never got off the ground I think the reason is fairly obviousAnother moderate Republican with a famous name and far more money squashed himlike a bug By offering electability as his chief selling point Alexanderhelped make the case for Bush W makes Lamar redundant But thats no reasonto despise a candidate who tried hard played fair and will surely make agracious exit
