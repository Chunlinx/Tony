                                 Drowsy Docs            A frightening studyrecently reported in the New England Journal of Medicine  found thatlonghaul truck drivers frequently nod off on the road An accompanyingNEJM editorial forcefully emphasized the safety importance of adequatesleep Yet somehow medicines premier journal ignored physician training inwhich residents work even longer hours without any sleep at all If driving atruck on five hours of sleep is dangerous surely taking care of deathly illpatients on no sleep is too            Thetrucking study found that although longhaul drivers had at least eight hoursoff a day they slept only  hours on averagenighthaulers just  hoursIt clearly wasnt enough Surveillance videotape showed that  percent driftedoff for at least six minutes while traveling over  miles per hour Drowsinesswas worst during the night and among those with the least amount of sleep Onbrainwave recordings two drivers even fell into light sleepone for minutes  seconds Fortunately no one crashed Nonetheless sleepy truckerswere dangerously impaired            The NEJM editorial hailed the study as yet moreevidence that sleep deprivation kills Penned by Stanford sleep expert DrWilliam Dement the editorial pointed to previous work showing sleep lossharmed performance just as much as alcohol did Truckers and pilots who workdrowsy it said are as dangerous as those who work drunk And residentsAccording to Dement his original version did include residents butNEJM editors removed such references Perhaps it was because of lengthhe suggested A more likely explanation is that the journal found it easier toneedle others than to take on its own profession The NEJM declined tocomment            Inresidency sleep deprivation like illness and death is a fact of life Freshout of medical school residents get onthejob training performing daytodaypatient care in academic hospitals According to these hospitals firstyearresidents work  to hour weeks and up to  days consecutively and somethink these estimates understate the case Residents routinely work hourstretches often without sleep            During my first two years of surgery residencyI worked from  to  hours a week depending on how busy things wereTypically I arrived at  am and left at  pm except every third nightwhen I stayed to take care of patients while my team went home Pages wereincessant Mrs T just threw up The gallbladder lady isnt breathing verywell I got sleep in snatchessome nights totaling four hours or more othersnone at all Regardless I operated through the next day like any other            Constantfatigue cant be good for patient care In the infamous Libby Zion case in NewYork City in which an yearold died while under a fatigued residents carea  grand jury denounced physician training as unsafe Yet over a decadelater no rigorous research like the trucking study has been done The limitedstudies that exist bode poorly for good doctoring Although tired residentsmaintain reaction time and manual dexterity surprisingly well they exhibitmemory deficits difficulties thinking clearly and decreased vigilance Theyalso develop alarming levels of hostility toward patients            These studies ring true to me To be sure Im often amazedat how well I can do on no sleep When youre faced with a dying patient or adifficult operation adrenalin focuses your mind and marshals your energy Ihonestly think Im dependable in clutch situations even after  hours on thejob            But Imalso sure that routine care suffers Good care for sick people depends onattention to detailsgetting drug doses right checking every lab result andXray conscientiously remembering a patients allergies and old medicalproblems No matter how hard I try I know my memory and vigilance fail whenIm sleepdeprived At times I was so tired that I gave nurses orders that Ilater couldnt remember giving Backup systems do catch mistakes The computerwont accept my drug orders if I prescribe the wrong dose or ignore an allergyNurses remind me to check an Xray or question me when my order doesnt seemright Nonetheless many errors are not caught and I know I have seriouslyharmed patients because of fatigue            Ive felt the hostility too When yourefinally set to sleep or go home nothing is more frustrating than a patienthaving unexpected problems Rest becomes a matter of personal survival andresidents can be chillingly brusque with patients who need only time andsympathy Anger is so common that one Harvard residency program gives anaward each year to its angriest interns            Cananything be done Hospitals could hire more residents but that would increaseour physician glut In fact Congress banned hospitals from increasing residenthires this year Hospitals could hire physician assistants to handle calls thatdont require doctors but thats expensive Physician assistants get paidtwice a residents  yearly salary for working only  hours a week InNew York state guidelines for an hour maximum workweek were estimated toincrease staffing costs by a quarterbillion dollars per year Exceptions werequickly carved out for example surgical residents arent included and eventhen many hospitals could not afford to stick to the guidelines            Increasingly hospitals use cross coverage in which afresh resident covers patients for several other residents at night However aHarvard study showed that the covering residents made serious mistakes sixtimes more often than even fatigued residents They had too many patients andwith every patient new to them didnt know important details Tired doctorsmay not provide the best care but neither does a series of faceless doctorsworking shifts            Research by sleep experts toexamine resident safety and to test solutions is needed In any othercircumstance doctors would champion thorough dispassionate investigation andspare no expense to improve patients lives But on this subject the medicalprofession is asleep at the switch If it doesnt wake up soon anotherscandalous case will inevitably surface and the government will take mattersinto its own hands
