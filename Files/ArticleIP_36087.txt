DearPrudence                                                      About  years ago after growing up in afamily without an appreciation of family values I decided I didnt have muchuse for my relationships with my siblings Both parents are deceased and afternumerous efforts to get along with my sibs I just quit having any contact withthem This has alleviated a lot of stress in my life and I really dont missthem at all I have a great group of friends whom I consider my family Theyare there for me like my actual siblings never were and they understand thelack of contact                                       The problem is thatI run into people who after knowing me for a while are dumbfounded to findout I am not an only child and they act like theres something wrong with mebecause Im not in contact with my siblings I keep hearing But they are yourfamily I just figure I feel better mentally without the connection and Ishould keep things the way they are But all these family people think Ishould call and reconcile with them Is there something wrong with me Justbecause Im related to them am I really missing something by not having themin my life                                       Sincerely                                       Happy Without                        Dear Hap            Yes you are missing something Sturm undDrang  Prudie thought this one through years ago because of a kindredsituation though not with your particulars If a relationship is troublesomeor destructive for whatever reason and its comfortable to severcommunication there is no reason to stay yoked to a bad situation as thoughone were part of a team of mules            Prudie is familiar withoutsiders offering the advice that you should just fix it up Perhaps inyour case it would be simpler to tell new friends that you are an onlychild  because that is what youve made yourself and this would end theawkward conversations Nowhere is it written that children of the same motherand father have anything more in common than parents and people who push theissue belong in a home for the intrusive            Prudie experientially                                             DearPrudence                                                      I have been dating aman who unlike myself still resides under the watchful eye of his parentalunit Although his parents are very open and mostly mind their own businessthere is one issue that leaves me in a tight spot Coming from a conservativebackground my partner has stated on many occasions that his parents wontallow him to stay over at my apartment even though on some nights this wouldbe preferable to his making the long drive home We have been camping numeroustimes but always with friends which his parents approve of Trying to plan aweekend getaway for our anniversary has been particularly trying as hisparents would be upset and he refuses to lie to his parents about where he isgoing Should I push the issue or just let sleeping dogs lie and wait for himto act like a man and make his own decisions                                       Sincerely                                       Trouble in Paradise well Toronto                        Dear Trub            You dont say how old you both are but youreclearly old enough to spend the night together  and obviously have Prudieis getting definite vibes that your young mans parental unit comes withstrong apron strings            You have two optionsYou can insist that your fellawhom I presume to be over sit his parentsdown and tell them about the birds and the bees It seems to Prudie that hisparents are free to follow their own moral code but so is he If they invitehim out of their house that might not be such a bad idea If he is unwillingto stand up to them and assert himself then perhaps to use your phrase heshould lie alone with the sleeping dogs  I mean the parental unit            Prudie autonomously                                             DearPrudie                                                      The end of the worldmust be nigh There was a news story about a couple in Philadelphia who paidfor their  wedding by selling advertising space at the ceremony andreception Everything according to Reuters from the wedding rings to a weekat a penthouse in Cancun was donated after the groom got  companies tosponsor the nuptials in exchange for having their names appear six timesfromthe invitations to the thank you notes The bride drew the line at havingadvertising banners draped across the aisle but her perfume came from a localOscar de la Renta distributor and the coffee was provided gratis from aneighborhood supplier Well you get the idea What do you think of allthis                                       Brooksie                        Dear Brooks            Gauche gauche gaucheand tacky This cannot be the wave of the future though so calm yourselfThis is just the act of two tasteless clods who fancy themselves businessminded Prudie hesitates to think of when the baby arrives  so shewont            Prudie gapingly                                             DearPrudence                                                      I would like yourtake on workplace etiquette concerning paychecks and benefits I am beginningto wonder if these are things we earn or gifts from Santa Currently I workfor a law firm but I have had this experience with every job Ive had in myplus years of workingeven when I worked as a waitress Employers act likeits taboo or in bad form to speak of paychecks as in Are the checks intoday on pay day Are we supposed to just keep checking our mailbox or underour desk blotters to see if Santa was good to us this month Whats with thishushhush attitude when it comes to being compensated for a job welldone                                       Twin Cities                        Dear Twin            You must be the queen ofcoincidence to have worked for over  years at different places where thedelivery of paychecks was erratic Prudie would suggest that you go to theoffice manager where you work now or whoever writes the checks and ask thatthe time for their distribution be regularized You need not be shy If anyonetries to close you down or makes you feel as though your are talking aboutthings best left unspoken just tell that person assertively that if you areinterested in guessing games you will pull out your Ouija board Prudie thinksif you make an issue of it you will get results            Prudie huffily
