PRESENTATION OF RANDI YOUELLS LSC VICE PRESIDENT FOR PROGRAMSFOR THE ONTARIO LEGAL AID SPEAKER SERIESThank you for inviting me to your wonderful Country and thebeautiful city of Toronto to talk with you about the subject thathas been the primary focus of my professional life over the lasttwentyseven yearsthe provision of high quality legal services topeople who could not otherwise afford legal aid As did many of youin this room I started my legal aid journey fresh out of lawschool in  As I was sworn in as a licensed attorney in thestate of Iowawhich is a small rural farming state located in themidwestern part of our countryI optimistically and mistakenlybelieved that my life in legal services would be a short one Itruly believed that in my lifetime I would witness the eradicationof poverty and injustice I believed that I would see the day whenno personbe they American or Canadianwould go hungry at night Ibelieved to the very core of my soul that the human race was on thebrink of a new era in which intolerance and bigotry and prejudicewould no longer exist But as we all know today that young womenwho started her life in legal services in  full of hope andpromiseand just a wee bit navewas not correct about what thefuture would holdToday in the offices of the Legal Services Corporation of Iowayoung attorneys are providing legal assistance to the children andthe grandchildren of the clients I tried to help  years agoToday in our country hundreds of thousands of people live in ourstreets Today millions of children go to bed hungry at nightToday just like  years ago racial and ethnic bigotry remainsthe central reality of most of our clients lives Todayjust likeyesterdaythousands of people daily knock on the door of legalservices and they are told no one is home And that is thereality that brings us here on this beautiful September dayBecause we are older and wiserand perhaps more damaged and morebattlescarredwe know that the promise of legal services has notbeen fulfilled But perhaps because within all of us therecontinues to live younger more idealistic lawyersa whisper of thelawyers we were at the beginning of our professional liveswe arehere today because we are not ready to let go of the promise oflegal services We are not ready to call it quits We are not readyto stop believing that we can build a worldclass legal servicesdelivery system in both of our countriesThats what I will speak to you about today Although most of myremarks will be devoted to the steps we have undertook within mycountry to revitalize a struggling legal services deliverysystemsteps that we often colloquially refer to as stateplanningstate planning has always been for me but a tool Theoverarching goal has always beenand will always bethe creation ofworld class legal services delivery systems in which no client orpotential client is turned away After all in a democracy thehalls of justice must always stand wide open and everyone must bewelcome to walk through them unimpeded and unchallengedLets start with a history lesson Legal services programs inthe United States began in the s as special model projectsinitiated by the federal governments Office of EconomicOpportunity They were infused with the idealism and spirit of theKennedy years and strengthened by President Johnsons vision of aGreat Society Under President Nixon who signed the Legal ServicesAct of  they became an institution and over time a familiarpart of the legal landscape in every US state and territoryUntil very very recently LSC programs were organized andoperated pretty much as they had a quarter of a century ago Theywere locally focused and passionately promoted local controlMany of the staff made legal services their careers Some of theprograms managers stayed with one program for their entireprofessional lifetimes In some programs board membershipterminated only with the members death The kinds of caseshandled the strategies for addressing the legal needs of servicearea residents and the client community itself remained prettymuch the same in most LSC programs until the s And while theidealism and vision of a new world remained part of our mantra itsplace of honor receded as legal services became business as usualfor many granteesSeveral events in the mids brought an end to this way oflife for the legal services community in my country The Congresswhich controls our funding levels began to include many memberswho did not support the purpose and goals of a federal civil legalservices program Consequently funding appropriations diminishedor failed to keep up with the cost of living Then in the middleof the decade a vigorous effort to do away with legal servicesresulted in a funding bill that carried significant restrictionsincluding one that prohibited programs from seeking attorneysfees Additional restrictions prevented our grantees from doingmuch of the work they had previously handledrepresenting prisonersin civil litigation representing certain groups of immigrantsrepresenting clients in class action lawsuits The Congress alsotold LSC that it could not continue to fund its granteespresumptively and that it must begin to distribute its funds on acompetitive basis This union of significant funding declinesrestrictions and competition began to inexorably change the waythat legal services in the United States operateAs a funder and as an organization concerned with seeing thatlowincome people who struggle with critical civil legalemergencies such as evictions and domestic violence have access tothe justice system LSC was not willing to accept the guide pathto oblivion that some had designed for our future In  LSCbegan to initiate a series of efforts that we believed would ensurethat services to clients did not falter in a time of decreasingresources and limited opportunities Needless to say most of thefield as we refer to the collective entity that constitutes ourgrantee programs was already frightened and concerned because ofthe funding drops new restrictions and competition fears When in LSC announced its intent to launch an initiative that wouldrequire massive restructuring of the national legal servicesdelivery system the announcement was also quite frightening andwas not greeted in many quarters with open armsSo what has LSC done to restructure the American legal servicesdelivery system since  The most innovative and certainly themost difficult part of our strategy to move our grantees into newapproaches to serving clientsand the one that has received themost attention both good and badis the State Planning strategythat we launched in  As it was conceived and as it has playedout LSCs State Planning Initiative is anew visioni for legal services in which eligible clients inevery state are afforded an equal opportunity to avail themselvesand ultimately to attain highquality civil legal assistance In aneffort to foster more consistent levels of statewide service and toeliminate service gaps that leave clients in geographicallyremote areas underrepresented compared to their urban counterpartsLSC has asked each of its grantees to undergo a fundamentalparadigm shift in their program vision Program leaders have beeninstructed to abandon the parochial thinking of Whats best forclients in my service area and asked instead to consider Whatsbest for clients throughout my state and ultimately Whats bestfor clients throughout the United StatesI think that it is important for you to know that LSC initiallystressed the importance of state planning in  when it asked itsrecipients in each state to participate in the development of aplan for the design configuration and operation of LSCfundedprograms in their states The  Program Lettersii were primarilydeveloped it response to funding cuts and restrictions that hadcrippled legal services in our country These early planningdocuments laid the foundation for what was to come in  in thatthey began to set forth a vision for legal services delivery andenumerated the issues and criteria that state planning shouldaddress However except for a handful of states the  callsfor state planning were largely ignored and to be honest LSC didlittle during this time period to promote nationwide strategicplanningIn  the State Planning Initiative was reinitiated LSCProgram Letters iii and iv directed programs to planfor the creation of comprehensive integrated coordinated legalservices systems and defined the terms of such systems Granteeswere required to submit a report outlining their state plans byOctober   Their plans were to include responses to the seveninitial central tenets of State Planning development of intake advice and referral services effective usage of technology  increased access to legalselfhelp and prevention information  coordination of legalwork training information and expert assistance  engagementof pro bono attorneys  development of additional state localand private resources and  optimal configuration of serviceareasLSC did not confine its directives to what a plan shouldinclude It also laid out the parameters of the planning processitself LSC instructed its grantee programs to collaborate with arange of local state and national stakeholders including stateand local bar associations Interest On Lawyers Trust AccountIOLTA administrators state judiciaries client groups pro bonocommissions state legislatures nonLSCfunded legal servicesprograms and a host of others LSC required its grantees in eachstate to work with each other and with other equal justicestakeholders to develop justice communities that best respond toclients most compelling needs ensure the most strategic andcosteffective use of all available resources and maximize theopportunity for clients statewide to receive timely effective andappropriate legal servicesIn  guided by the belief that access to quality legalservices is critical to a fair adversarial justice system andcommitted to making significant improvements in the delivery systemthe LSC Board of Directorsv approved and enacted its own strategicplanStrategic Directions which was adopted in January The twin objectives of Strategic Directions  were todramatically increase the number of lowincome Americans who canaccess the civil justice system and to ensure that all clientsreceive quality legal services Strategic Directions  wasdeveloped as a forwardlooking document It reinforced the StatePlanning Initiative already in place by calling state planning itsmost important strategyIn  LSCs goala goal shared by many of our partners in theAmerican equal justice movement like the American Bar Associationand the National Legal Aid and Defender Associationwas to obtain acritical mass of new ideas funds and partners into the nationallegal services community and to assist thousands of clients whowere being denied access to civil justice because funding wasdiminished because programs were failing to keep up withtechnological and other innovations and because many of ourgrantees worked in isolation within states and across state linesThis was a tremendous change for our grantees and for the deliverysystem that we funded However the state planning initiative wasalso a big change as some would say a huge paradigm shift forLSC as an organization For years LSC had defined itself by thevery traditional roles of funder and regulatory agency The stateplanning initiative required LSC to become something differenttransforming itself into an agent of change and an equity partnercapable of effecting largescale reformation in a moribund deliverysystem And as any one versed in organizational psychology or evenexperienced in managing a large organization knows suchtransformations do not come easy they are seldom painless andthey require the staff of the organization leading such atransformation to put themselves on the line in ways that often areunfamiliar and unpleasant LSC was no exception and today withinthe walls of LSC you will find employees who still do notunderstand or support the state planning initiative Indeed inrecent internal budget battles within LSC projects essential tothe creation of world class delivery systems such as thedevelopment of a new measurement system to measure our work and thework of our grantees in terms of outcomes for clients and projectsto ensure that the delivery system is inclusive andmulticulturally competentwere summarily removed from the firstdrafts of the budget by the staff who prepare the budget Fundingfor these projects was ultimately restored but not without theintervention of the LSC President and the Board of Directors Andeven today some staffincluding staff that work for meat timesmention that they do not support LSCs state planning initiativeand believe that our state planning work is beyond our centralmission Fortunately many other staff do not see it in the samewayThe creation of a worldclass delivery system involved more thanstate planning per se LSC also launched companioninitiativesthe quality initiative the diversity initiativetechnology initiative grants to name just a few that workedhandinglove with state planning to promote the development ofhighquality delivery systems One of the most important companionprojects was and continues to be competition At the same time thatLSC was launching its state planning initiative Congress requiredLSC to cease funding its grantees presumptively and to begin tofund programs on a competitive basis Today LSC has been providingfunding on a competitive basis for seven years In reality therehas been very little actual competition for our federal fundsThere are many reasons for this lack of real competition Firstand probably foremost as we all know providing highquality legalservices to lowincome persons is not as easy as it looks Itrequires systems and practices and mindsets and commitments thatmay be foreign to many other nonprofit providers of humanservices Moreover the fact that Congress has placed numerousrestrictions on legal services funding in the UnitedStatesrestrictions that then attach to nonLSC fundscauses manyorganizations that might otherwise seriously consider applying forLSC funds to choose not to do so However the fact that thecompetition process has not resulted in widespread competitionfor funding does not mean that it has not been successful IndeedI feel that the competition process has been successful in waysthat I would not have ever envisioned when I was hanging out inlegal services programs in Iowa and New Jersey in the seventieseighties and nineties Why Because the first step in setting up asystem of competition was to develop standards and benchmarks thatwe would use to evaluate programs and assess applicantseligibility And this was an importantand perhaps in Americanlegal servicesquite revolutionary development The fact thatbenchmarks exist means that there is a standard that all granteesmust meet before they are funded by LSC It means that LSC has aregular means of gathering important qualitative and quantitativeinformation on all our grantees against which we can evaluate theirservices and their improvement But it also means that there areaspirational goals for perfection that define a highqualitylegal services program We have found that many of our granteeswork hard to attain those aspirational goals Competition wasdesigned to improve quality And I think that will be its lastinglegacy the fact that is has improved quality over the last sevenyears and it will continue to do so Each year the legal servicesdelivery system in the United States gets better at the business ofcompetition as LSC refines and improves the process and as ourgrantees individually and collectively become the kinds ofhighquality legal services programs of which we can all beproudCompetition in and of itself is now a major tool used by LSCto develop a worldclass delivery system We use it to push ourgrantees toward stronger and more aggressive delivery of servicesto clients It allows us to create more forceful means ofconditioning our grants It allows us to measure programperformance in more sophisticated ways But linking competition tostate planning has expanded the impact of both of these initiativesin powerful ways that we were not able to envision in  Let meexplainWhen an applicant seeks federal funding from LSC and as theybecome grantees they are required as a condition of continuedfederal funding to pursue state planning with all other LSCfundedgrantees The penultimate goals is the establishment ofcommunities of justice in every state The core elements of theplanningcompetition link are as followsGrantees must commit to not only providing quality legalservices within their service area but also to working with otherlegal services providers to develop a comprehensive coordinatedintegrated delivery systemGrantees must commit to join with other equal justicestakeholders to establish statewide delivery systemscapableaspirationallyof serving every eligible client in a statedespite geographic cultural and physical barriers thatexistGrantees must commit to utilizing new technologiesselfhelp materials new intake systems and multicultural staff toreach underserved clientsGrantees must prove to LSC that their service areaboundaries are as relevant to clients and their communities as whenthey were first drawn or they must work together and with us toredraw themGrantees must work collaboratively with groups andorganizations they may have historically considered to becompetitors for scarce funds such as other nonprofit human andsocial services agencies and nonLSC funded legal servicesprograms or unlikely partners judges legislators barleadersGrantees must leverage additional resources to expandservices to lowincome person andHeres the kickergrantees must do all of this or riskthe loss of their federal fundingAs I noted earlier the state planning initiative was a hugeshift in thinking for the legal services community But initiallymost grantees thought that like many other projects begun by LSCthey only had to wait it out and it too would disappear into theozone or Ethernet or wherever legal services ideas go to find theireternal rest But LSC quickly began to prove we were serious aboutplanning We highlighted model systems in our literature andprogram visits At LSC Board meetings local events and nationalconferences we showcased exemplary planning and implementation Wedeveloped technical assistance funds for creative planning projectsand obtained a  million commitment from Congress to underwritesophisticated hardware Webbased and telephonic systems to expandservices for clients Internally LSC staff worked aggressively tocalibrate units within the Programs Division so that everyprogrammatic effort advanced the creation of highquality deliverysystems For example grantaward decisions and visits to assessprogram quality also focused on the efficacy of statewide systemsand collaborative efforts with other agencies serving the clientcommunity As a result over time and with much gnashing of teeththe elephant did begin to dance and LSC its grantees and thefederallyfunded legal services delivery system began to evolvefrom a piecemeal Great Society experiment to carefully chosennonprofit corporations working together to serve poor clients inevery jurisdictionThe most enduring legacy of the state planning initiativeatleast in terms of its first four yearshas probably has been itssuccess in fostering cooperation among stakeholders In  states had designated state planning bodies dedicated tostrengthening legal services Today  states have such bodiesmost others are in the midst of creating one An essential functionof these bodies is establishing publicprivate coalitions tomaximize grantees ability to leverage their federal investmentFor example last year in  the engagement of judgeslegislators and private bar members helped spawn appropriations forlegal services in  states totaling  million  almost threetimes more than states appropriated in  Meanwhile private barcampaigns quadrupled their fundraising from  million in  to million in  Ten years ago when I was a legal servicesprogram director in Iowa the private bar was either our adversaryor a somewhat disfavored cousin in the family of legal servicesJust like families with unsavory family members legal servicesprograms tolerated the presence of private lawyers in our pro bonomodels of delivery because we had tonot because we thought theywere doing anything useful Today in most parts of our countrythe partnerships between legal services programs and the privatebar are deep and true Private lawyers have an enhancedunderstanding of the importance of our work We in turnunderstand the vital role they play in helping to assure that noclient goes unserved Ten years ago a judge was someone you sawbehind the bench when you went to court Today judges from alllevels including Chief Justices of state Supreme Courts speak outabout the need for quality legal services for poor Americans andwork with us to try to respond to the problems that are beingpresented to the United States justice system as a whole as thenumber of selfrepresented litigants grows exponentiallyState Planning also has improved access for the fastestgrowingclient subgroup nonEnglish speakers Over the last several yearsLSC has partnered with other associations like the AfricanAmericanProject Directors Association to promote inclusion andmulticultural competency Today legal services advocates areincreasingly bilingual  percent of employees at LSCfundedprograms in my country speak more than one language In additionselfhelp multilingual computer kiosks have overcome languagebarriers to help Native Americans living on reservations  andVietnamese and Spanish immigrants in California  enforce theirlegal rights without knowing a word of EnglishAnd I personally believe that the quality and effectiveness ofadvocacy also has improved over the last four years The primedirectives of state planning emphasize quality training holisticlegal services and crossprogram advocacy and LSC and its granteeshave paid increasing attention to the quality of the services weprovide to our clientsHow does this relate to Canada and specifically the initiativeyou propose to launch to address issues that trouble your legalservices system Legal services programs in Canada are about thesame age as ours and serve a similar client community You facejust like us certain problemsInsufficient fundingOutmoded delivery systemChanges in client communityChanges in the lawTechnological changes andThe need to prepare for the futureThese are pretty serious problems At times they even appearinsurmountable But that doesnt mean that we shouldnt try toaddress them in a proactive and straighton manner So I am goingto conclude my remarks today by offering you some guidance as yougive thought to launching your own planning initiative Considerthem my personal lessons from six years in the planningtrenchesFirst although our state planning initiative is highlyreplicable for any organization trying to effect rapid changeacross a large and entrenched culture of individual programs oroffices such change is only possible if you are willing to beinclusive and collaborative in setting goals and processes yetfirm and resolute in their ultimate enforcementSecond it is going to require massive change not only amongyour providers in the field but within your own organizationsHistorically LSC directives were seen by grantees as antitheticalto their mission so they resisted change while nonethelessremaining largely dependent on the waning federal investment Inorder to overcome this obstacle we had to change the way we didbusiness We ramped up LSCs profile by visiting programs andparticipating in local meetings and national conferences to relayour message hear reactions and improve relationships And thissame consistent message was repeated over and over again by key LSCstaff wherever they traveledincluding the President the otherVicePresidents and the staff on the ground who were guidingstates through the planning process You will have to be willing todo the same You will needall of you will needto be highlyvisible personally and professionally And you must recognize andaccept that doing so will take inordinate amounts of your time andyour energyThird you willlet me repeat that loudly and firmlyyou WILLface resistance Any effort to change a longestablished systemwill meet resistance That is inevitableHowever the good news is that you can slowly overcome thisresistance over time But timeand timingwill be crucial It wonthappen overnight and it wont happen without some setbacks Wefailed when we pushed willing but unprepared grantees toopportunities they were not ready to exploit We also suffered morethan was necessary by not including willing grantees and otherequal justice stakeholders early on as our partners in the processof effectuating change We didnt realize how long it was going totake before we would begin to see some successes And then wefailed to celebrate those successes as important milestones andvictories So expect resistance Commit to the long haul Andcelebrate your intermediary successes along the journeyFourth tie planning to quality early on and stick with itPlanning is not an end It is a means to an end and you mustclearly and consistently articulate the end that you envisionTalk quality all of the time Vigorously promote those legalservices programs that provide highquality legal assistanceholding them out as programs others should emulate Establish andshare best practices Be willing to stick your neck out and holdconferences and meetings on quality issues of interest to the legalservices communities In the last several years LSC has hostednumerous conferences where advocates can share ideas such asDiversity in the Legal Services Community Making Mergers Work andCreating ClientCentered Communities of Justice Had we had moremoney we would have facilitated more conferences They are animportant mechanism to bring people together to findanddefinecommon groundFifth put your money where your mouth is Set aside moneyspecifically for planning Since  LSC has awarded more than in technical assistance funds for State Planning projectsAnd although we could have used lots more this small sum did allowus to publicly recognize highperformers and promote planningmodels for others to emulate But money is important for anotherreason Planning has costs and you need to be seen as anorganization that understands those costs and is willing to helpgrantees and other stakeholders with some of the planningcostsSixthFamiliarize yourself with Sol Alinksys Rules forRadicals Not because you are going to use it But because MrAlinksy lays out what you can personally expect to happen to you ifyou are in the forefront of this initiative Mr Alinksy instructshis readers to pick an issue find an adversary and make itpersonal And that may be you at the wrong end of the personalattacks So get psychologically prepared and dont be blindsidedby the venom Although your journey is going to be difficult and attimes you will doubt yourselves the benefits to clients are wellworth it and the satisfaction of hearing even the most recalcitrantof adversaries say that the new system is better than the one thatwent before is deeply rewarding And remember what your Grandmotherprobably said to you a long time agowhat doesnt kill you probablymakes you strongerSeventhDont ignore the need to promote the value of planninginternally among all of your staff One of the most stupid errorsthat LSC made as we kicked off an era of planning was not to takethe timeand expend the energyto make other offices and unitswithin our own organization understand the importance of what wewere doing and their vital role in helping promote and developworldclass delivery systems This set up needless competition forscarce resources and created hurt feelings among some staffAnd finallykeep your eye on the prize Remember the person whofirst decided to go to law school think about that young excitedlawyer starting hisher first job remember the neophyte attorneynewly admitted to the practice of law who was excited scared andenthralled about the future We all cared deeply about justice whenwe started this journey And we care deeply about it today or wewouldnt be here together in this room We will settle for nothingless than a worldclass delivery system And although we are alittle older and slightly grayer and certainly more jaded and weknow now that we wont see it happen in our lifetimes we stillbelieveI still believethat our collective dream of a justicesystem that lets client walk through the doors of justice unimpededand unshackled is a dream that we will achieve One day TogetherHere in Canada And in the United StatesThank you again for allowing me to be with you todayi Twentyfive years ago our government made a pledge to helpensure that all persons have access to Americas civil justicesystem by enacting legislation that created Legal ServicesCorporation Over the past  years LSC has helped millions oflowincome citizens solve important sometimes lifethreateningcivil legal problems Despite the success of LSC and its manycontributions to access to justice for lowincome Americans itsachievements are overshadowed by the fact that so many in oursociety continue to suffer injustice and are unable to gain accessto a lawyer for critical legal assistance Until all members of oursociety are afforded that access this promise of our governmentwill continue to be unfulfilled LSC is committed to promoting anew vision of legal services that will achieve the goal of bringinglegal services to those currently denied access to the justicesystemii Program Letter  directed LSC recipients to developplans to stretch scarce federal dollars in the most effectiveefficient ways possible The letter also anticipated the passage ofcongressional restrictions on the activities of LSC programsprompting LSC to instruct its programs to forge deeper bonds withother stakeholders including nonLSC funded programs state andlocal bar associations IOLTA administrators the judiciary andclient groups Program Letter  provided a general outline asto the issues and criteria that the state planning process shouldaddress Significant emphasis was placed on the integration ofLSCfunded programs into statewide legal services delivery systemsand the seven central tenets of state planning were identifiediii Program Letter  published on February  called upon all LSC recipients to analyze any progress made towardthe development of the legal services model envisioned by stateplanners Programs were to evaluate whether all programs wereworking cohesively to assure that urgent clients needs were beingaddressed whether sufficient capacities for training andinformationsharing existed whether programs were moving forwardon technology and whether they were collaborating to increaseresources and develop new initiatives to expand the scope of theirservices Grantees were also asked to examine whether the existingprogram configuration was conducive to the most effective statedelivery system Grantees were asked to examine their progress ineach of the seven principal areas of State Planning in a mannerthat included assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the currentapproach establishing goals to strengthen and expand services toeligible clients and determining the major steps yet to be takenand a timetable necessary to achieve those goals LSC set adeadline of October   for submission of state planningreportsiv Program Letter  published on July   respondedto recipient requests for guidance and additional information onwhat was expected in their state planning reports It includedState Planning Considerations designed to address requests foradditional information regarding statewide goals capacities andapproaches recipients should consider in their state planningprocesses Program Letter  stated that the State PlanningInitiative will provide information to aid LSC in exercising itsstatutory responsibility to insure that grants and contracts aremade so as to provide the most economical and effective delivery oflegal assistance to persons in both urban and rural areasv LSC is headed by an member board of directors appointed bythe President and confirmed by the Senate By law the board isbipartisan and no more than six members may be of the samepolitical party
