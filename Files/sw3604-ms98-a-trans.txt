        names Brian     hi im Rita from Garland   oh nice to meet you Rita   uh we have quite a in depth subject here dont we   yeah we do   why couldnt we get something simple like movies or books something more uh more fun   exactly some of the boring ones you just kind of babble on i guess   yeah well we will well just give lots to talk about wont we   all right we ready to give it a shot all right   yeah thats right     okay   okay well uh i have a business of my own   uhhuh   and i feel pretty strongly about it i dont mind being drug tested and i dont feel the employees should   yeah i agree with that i think especially in some of the the jobs that the government has you just need people who are you know   now you know   who are sober all the time to take care of them you know youre paying them to do a certain job and if theyre theyre on drugs and doing things theyre not supposed to be doing   no i i i you know i think sometimes that when you fly for example you know pilots and things like that or people um   uhhuh   that are even  using uh automated equipment of some kind where another person could be injured you know   absolutely   you know and uh well a lot of times i think it depends upon the occasion but you know ive never had any problem with being drug tested and i wouldnt think that other people should have either i guess thats sort of a personal opinion   yeah well you know what i think part of the thing that you do when you apply for a job is you you know you tell them that youre gonna do a certain type of work and be a certain type of person and you know i think part of that is living the law   umhum   i know if i had my own company id want people who are honest in all theyre dealings so   well i have a private high school and uh we uh get permission from the parents before the children the students enroll   uhhuh   to allow random drug testing because ive seen what can happen to youngsters who were not on drugs being around it and getting influenced by their peers who are   umhum   and theres a lot of it in the public school system   oh absolutely i was i went to school in Plano when i was growing up   and   and just i dont know it was  i was surprised how much of it was there   yeah and of course good kids try to stay away from it but ive seen kids start out not being on drugs and end up being there because it was being sold right out under under their noses you know   yep   so uh you know i feel pretty strongly about it i you know i know that there are people that say were violating the civil rights and what have you but they dont have to enroll   yeah   you know they dont have to take that job if thats the way they feel about it   yeah and i think the second part to that is you know theyre also violating civil rights when theyre using these drugs illegal drugs   yeah thats right theyre violating ours you know   yeah and i think you know personally i the way i feel about it is its a lot better that we go ahead and and help these people you know that when we find that theyre theyre using drugs that we help them to get over that so they can be good people or not not necessarily im not saying theyre bad people but they they can be productive people   well they can be more productive and more useful yeah i feel that way too we dont uh kick them out we ask that we call parents in if we havent had one test positive yet but   right   if it did we would call the parents in and uh you know get help for them before its too late   uhhuh absolutely you know i think i look at especially some of the professional athletes and i was a big Mavericks fan for a long time and i watched Roy Tarpley you know   oh he just   he could have lost his life if it wasnt for someone who cared enough to say lets give you a drug test and find out where youre at   umhum and uh you know its just really a shame that he he couldnt get enough help to keep his career going   absolutely i think its important that we remember that its not the job thats important thing its its the individual kind of like what you were saying that its just i dont know to me thats its putting the focus back where it should be you know sure some people might not appreciate it but when it comes right down to it youre more worried about the individual and where their status is   yeah i think so and uh i think that youngsters who looked up to the Roy Tarpleys and uh the other people that have gotten into drugs i think theyre going to be more conscious of the effect it can have and they get you know look at what hes thrown away   yeah   you know a wonderful career a tremendous amount of money uh because he couldnt get enough help to over come it   uhhuh   and probably wasnt started early enough either   yeah   no but i think they can influence the youngsters in a good positive way when theyre good role models   oh absolutely and i think thats the key   now i think so too and like its important you know i dont i have never been against being drug tested myself and so i feel that the owner of a company you know you set forth the policy and you follow through with it too   yeah   you know and it doesnt exclude this one or that one its everybodys its all its all inclusive   yep   i know TI does that TI uh you know they never know who whos gonna be called   well thats good i i i like that idea very much   you know umhum its just a random thing that theyll get a call in the morning
