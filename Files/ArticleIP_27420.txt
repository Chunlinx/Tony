hierarchy than Cyrus Sanais  WhenI went to high school in the late s we used to have this program calledAllStar whose stated purpose was to eliminate cliques and bring the schooltogether The program thought it could do this by a making us watchPepsisponsored movies featuring antidrug propaganda and shrewd productplacement b reinforcing the most obnoxious cliques on campus by choosing allthe All Star officers from a popular group of athletes and cheerleaders onaverage B and C students who drank smoked and skipped class c doingeverything possible to conceal the fact that high schools purpose iseducation and d giving us the opportunity to buy as much All Starmerchandise as our parents could afford It was insulting and embarrassing andthank God only lasted a few months            Programs like All Starare colossal wastes of time that make teenagers hate school because theyemphasize exactly what they attempt to eliminate I hope people who have kidsin high school will realize this and will not think that that is enough to endtragedies like that at Columbine             KevinKramer                        Williamsburg Va                           The RodriguezWe                        I think Cyrus Sanai missedthe point of the Richard Rodriguez essay in the Los Angeles               Times last Sunday see Community Kills When Rodriguez talked aboutcommunity he was not talking about the need for more school spirit orcollective pride in the success of highschool teams And he certainlyrecognized the social divisions within the school as well an athlete whosingled out a Jew for being different comes to mind            The kind of community he means does not come frompep rallies or car washes but rather from a value system and a curriculum thatteach the common bonds that we as Americans have Not celebrations ofmulticulturalism but a history for example that connects Thomas Jeffersonand Malcolm X as Rodriguez writes            Also missing asRodriguez points out is any structured family or neighborhood in many youngpeoples lives That is the we he is talking about of belonging to somethingand having that foundation laid prior to going to school and reachingadolescence Not living an anonymous life in your room or on the Internet Thelack of these positive networks he argues as do others is why many innercity kids look for family in gangs The lack of strong families in too manyyoung lives makes the public schools job poorly conceived and performed aswell according to Rodriguez of teaching and bringing a sense of connection toother Americans past and present nearly impossible This is a longtermproblem and he knows it He is certainly not calling for more cries of Goteam or Beat Northside High             Mike Hollon                        Alexandria Va                                             Cyrus Sanaireplies I think Rodriguez is out of touch maybe quite happily with lifeas it is lived in the Columbine High Schools of America You cant teach commonbonds of history to teens while the school and the community stress athleticsas the most honored achievement In fact you cant teach them at all as anenvironment for educational and moral growth American public secondaryeducation will continue to be a miserable failure so long as the values of theinstitution are so at odds with its ostensible mission Only the betterAmerican colleges can salvage the mess left by high school and they are onlyas good as they are because of the competition and diversity among themMonkeying with a curriculum to give it the correct ideological spin is fine forthe careers of school administrators and educational consultants but it wontfool students They may not know much of the world but they certainlyunderstand what the high school rewards and it aint learning about Jeffersonor Malcolm X Indeed the grand prize for doing well academically at publichigh school is to get you as far away as possible from it to the Ivy Leagueand its ilk                                       Its possible of course that in an alternateuniverse where American high schools were truly academic institutions theseriously disturbed Harris and Klebold might have open fire on the brainsbut I doubt it first of all because Harris and Klebold would have receivedsome of the acceptance they craved on their own merits and secondly becausethey would not have despised the school so for favoring the intellectualachievers Among the most fierce hatreds of teens probably right after publichumiliation and rejection is of hypocrisy its why Holden Caulfield is one ofthe most authentic and moral voices in American literature                                       My second set of objections to thecommunitarian explanation of Littleton is the way it overblames parents Allof what you say about families is true yet irrelevant Its a given thatstrong familial relationships help keep kids on the straight path Note thatthe Harris and Klebold families from afar seem quite ordinary lacking thesocial pathologies typically blamed for deranged teenage psyches But the jobof forging these relationships never easy is made all the harder by thevalues fostered by the public schooling system The fiercely familyorientedusually devoutly Christian parents who increasingly pull their children out ofthe system in favor of home or religious schooling are correct to fear thecorrupting influence of the Columbine Highs                                       Such corruption is as much intellectual asmoral The religious schools shifting their emphasis from athletics tolearning even if a large part of it is of the Biblical variety haveconsistently delivered better results both in terms of educational and I wouldguess communal development than the public schools This is true mostnoticeably among minority scholarship students from weak familial backgroundswho have attended Catholic parochial schools I seem to recall Chicago havingthe most famous examples of these I am not advocating religious schooling asa solution but rather pointing out that educational institutions which havetheir community values focused on learning rather than spectator sports will bemuch more successful in education and will be substantially happier places forall students except of course the athletes and even they will benefit from abetter education                                       I think its an easyand welltraveled path to pin the blame for many social ills on the perceivedlack of communal cohesiveness in American life and in some sectors it may becorrect When it comes to suburban high schools though I can say as asurvivor of the experience that its a community almost perfectly designed tocrush twist and kill the spirits of those who are different thoughtful orjust have the bad luck to be on the wrong side of the schoolendorsed eliteSo when I come across intellectuals peddling more community as a solution itis necessary to let off both barrels of the sawedoff rhetorical realitycheck                                       Backfire                        I wonder if Steven Brillhas given much thought to his proposal to treat guns like we treat automobilesHe says in his with Margaret Carlson register them and license those whowould use them But he should put a little more thought into how we treatautomobiles There is no license requirement to own an automobile Todrive on a public street one must have a tag on the car indicating that thedriver has paid a fee to put it on the road In the state of Washington thisfee is based on the value of the car My piece of junk is about  a year tolicense            One must also have alicense to drive a car Ostensibly this is a safety measure to ensure thatonly competent drivers are on the road In reality any idiot can get one andwith minimal luck avoid taking a driving test ever again I ran a stop sign onmy test  years ago and still passed Both the car tags and the driverslicense entitle a person to drive in every state in the Union Under Brillssystem I could pay  a year to license a used revolver take a joke of atest administered by a surly bored bureaucrat and carry a concealed weaponanywhere in the country I think most gun nuts could go along with that             ClarkStooksbury                        PortTownsend Wash                           SteinLine
