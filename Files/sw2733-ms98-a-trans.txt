        whats uh   well what what kind of cars do you drive do you usually drive   right now we ive got a uh four year old Subaru and a two year old Honda   oh my goodness well were were were sort of sort of a General Motors family i guess thats the way we were raised and uh uh we were overseas for TI for a number of years and when we came back we suddenly find out weve got five licensed drivers in the family   oh goodness   yeah  and four cars and we bought some year old cars from National Car Rental at at least two of them we bought an Olds Calais and a Buick Skylark   really   uh for you know they each had twenty one thousand miles or something like that and turns out thats a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them and they can show you the records theyve gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that   umhum   uh then weve got an eighty six Chevy Spectrum that we bought new my daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her   uhhuh   and weve got a eighty four Toyota that we bought used so weve got four cars for our five licensed drivers its like musical chairs   i bet i bet   yeah one short  and uh but you know its interesting the two even though my dad uh was a Chevrolet man forever and ever ever and we were in the retail milk business and he had all Chevrolet milk trucks and       and we bought automobiles and all that and it was almost like and a Chevrolet dealer was our friend and it was almost like the minute we got old and bought anything like a but a Chevrolet itd be like going and spitting on his grave  but uh   yep   and we got older and got away and then we thought well you know you still could buy General Motors products and it was probably not that bad but uh we lived in Malaysia for TI in nineteen uh eighty one two three and four     umhum   and of course you dont buy General Motors products over there but we bought a Volvo and i have never had a car that ive loved more i just cant afford them here uh but i i just loved that car   no umhum   and uh we bought a uh we lived in the Philippines for TI in eighty five eighty six and eighty seven and we bought a uh Ford Telstar which is somewhat similar to the Taurus its sold in the in uh the Far Eastern countries Far East countries more   umhum i   then here but we really liked that and have you had experience with cars other than the ones youve had   well yeah we had uh we had these are the first cars that my husband and i have ever purchased ourselves the others were handmedowns through the families   umhum yeah   and those were always GM cars  uh Buicks and Chevrolets and um we were real happy with them  but all the ones that we ever had were the you know eight cylinder   yeah umhum oh yeah the big the big yeah   really rugged GM cars and all we had heard was was a lot of negative press about the smaller cars and we both drive  well forty five miles round trip every day   umhum sure sure   and so we wanted a smaller car when we got ready to buy we needed a smaller car to get better gas mileage  and quite frankly we were afraid of the of the GM small cars   yeah umhum umhum   you know as far as durability so we kind of   right   when when we had our larger cars we didnt mind um keeping them up you know doing the maintenance and everything on them  as long as we didnt have to do it very often   umhum yeah   but once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them  all of them you know  it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for them   yeah yeah it seems that something goes every month   yeah exactly   and im afraid were gonna be in that in another year with all of ours you know we got three eighty sixes and an eighty four and well probably be there with all of them you know its the same thing you know i dont know whether you uh classify the Skylark and the Calais as small i guess theyre intermediates   umhum umhum   uh but uh we went on a family trip to Massachusetts and there were five of us and uh five five of us never go anywhere together here everybody everybodys heading off in their own direction  and i rented a Buick Le Sabre   right umhum   and its the first big car i had since i had my nine passenger Impala station wagon from seventy six to eighty  and it made all the i i had forgotten what driving a big car was like     its like a yacht   it was just nice it floated   yeah what we had we sold our our we we traded in our Le Sabre for our Subaru   oh yeah   yeah it was a great car it just we ran ran the wheels right off of it   yeah yeah yeah and and uh you know ive read im in the quality business at TI im a quality manager and were were uh we deal we sell im in the semiconductor group and we sell to uh Ford Chrysler and GM uh GM Delco   umhum   and there is a amazing i am just uh really impressed with the with the quality consciousness that these those these companies have put into their procurement and its  uh its come about as a result of the competition from the Japanese   umhum   and uh uh i and you know we used to think Ford products were tinny i mean i was growing up i was taught that when i was growing up you know that that that real people bought General Motors products and you know and peons bought Ford products but just with the quality requirements   thats right   that Ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants and theyre really uh uh stressing this partnerships in quality and you know GM and Chrysler are doing that but i really think Fords got a leadership leadership position in this right now and i think its showing up in their automobiles their automobiles are getting a very good quality reputation right now   umhum   and uh uh we went to uh Austin a while back to a basketball tournament and we were gonna be meeting some of my wifes relatives down there so we decided rather than drive one of our cars down wed rent one and we went up to the local Budget and we were gonna get a Olds Eighty Eight or something he said ill tell you what for a dollar a day more ill give you a Lincoln Towncar   umhum hm   and we drove that down and i hated to turn that back in when we got back we had that for three days and i absolutely loved except i wouldnt wanna have to park it in tight places all the time   i bet no i wouldnt wanna have to pay for the gas either   uh but i absolutely loved that automobile  and you know it wasnt that id driving around down there we might have got sixteen to eighteen miles per gallon but on the trip down and back i filled up both coming and going so i knew what i actually got on the trip and it was about twenty four miles a gallon   umhum   uh and you know we just got it out on the highway and put it in cruise control at about sixty and let it let it float   umhum   and it was pretty nice are you are you are you planning on getting any additional or other cars   its a nice car no time soon um were our our kids we wont have anymore licensed drivers for about thirteen years  yes  so we um so we dont plan on purchasing anymore anytime soon both of our cars are getting   hm oh yeah yours is small umhum   oh around sixty thousand miles on them we drive a lot   oh yeah yeah you probably got another another thirty or forty thousand if you maintain them uh   umhum   weve got probably well get something in the next couple years my son will graduate from high school this year and and hes gonna go to Richland College one year behind us   umhum   its right you know in fact our house is adjacent adjacent to the Richland property he wants to go to Texas Tech and hes probably gonna have to go to Richland a year to get some grades in order  but uh the next year when he goes out to Tech he wants a pickup   a pickup   and i want a pickup i may get one and not let him have it but we have been looking at these red Chevrolet they theyre very popular around here     umhum   these uh red uh red Chevy pickups and uh well probably do something like that uh uh incidentally uh uh i dont know uh the uh the credit union has got a deal now where you decide what you want and you call this number  and uh they go negotiate the price for you and and or or send you to a guy with whom theyve already got a deal   umhum   and uh my boss just bought a Chevy pickup and he got three thousand dollars off the sticker price doing it this way   really   yeah and uh uh you know you you figure out the options go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and and tell him what you want and hell put you in touch with a certain guy a certain person at that dealers place   umhum   so im gonna try that the next time i buy one   i think thatd be a good idea   and and so you know i can go around and comparison shop and see if i can get a better negotiation on my own but  once uh one thing thats a pain in the neck buying automobiles is negotiating   yeah ive weve   yeah   weve weve kind of been the types that will say this is what we intend to spend this is the car we want will you sell me this car for that price   yeah and for that price   and and weve had we with our when we bought our Subaru the guy was like you cant do this to me and we were just like okay fine we we wont then you know and hes like no no no but   well go somewhere else yeah yeah and uh and i i think thats probably the way you got to do it when when i was young i went in and bought a uh or made a deal on a sixty this is nineteen sixty id first come to Texas and made a deal on a sixty red Impala convertible   umhum   that i just loved and this guy gave me this deal you know i told how much i wanted to pay  and for every fifty dollars hed have to go in and check with the boss and then id have to sign something saying that if he could get this rate   umhum   uh we would go ahead and buy uh uh if he could get this rate i promised to buy and i left there on a Saturday afternoon just totally exhausted i i was only twenty five years old or something  and i i left there and i   umhum   i uh id never done this before because id always bought my previous cars from the guy my dad bought his milk trucks from  and uh uh so i i got back and a salesman that lived in the apartment i did asked me uh uh if hed heard i was gonna get a car and asked me what i paid for it he said well hey uh before you go buying anything he says call this friend of mine at Wills Point it was a guy that owned a Chevrolet dealership up there  and i called the guy and made an appointment to come up Monday morning   umhum   and just driving fifty miles out of town it was a difference and i mean it was a difference of four hundred dollars but this was four hundred dollars on only twenty five hundred is all we paid for cars in those days  and uh   goodness   uh so i called back the guy in Dallas and i told him that id left him a check for tax title and license and everything  and i said i wanna cancel my order and and dont try to cash the check because im gonna ive stopped payment on it already and he says oh somebodys taking he said what did you get a deal for Bill and i told him he says somebodys taking you for a ride and i said no somebody took me for a ride last Saturday and uh uh and i i find that uh and for the longest time then i drove up to Wills Point and the and the and the fellow died since then and and some of his relatives taken over the business and but and since then i hadnt really   thats right
