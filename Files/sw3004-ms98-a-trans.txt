              so well she lives in Utah so   oh uhhuh uhhuh thats the way we always were we always lived away from our family and relatives while the kids were growing up   yeah   so   you know   well i guess were going to talk about children today   okay lets do it   so you ready   my children are all gone already theyre theyre all out on their own   uhhuh   so uh do you want to start first do you you uh do you work   okay no i dont i stay home most of the time but i know that its very difficult to to find good help sometimes when and especially when your when you want your children to be taken care of   uhhuh uhhuh right   um you know theres a my neighbor she tends children though and and um theres a big controversy whether they should have to um have a a law a law to have them certified or or not and um you know theres pros and cons on both side of that because if they were then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing or some kind of something to be okay okay get an okay seal   right umhum yeah but yet most of the problems we hear of course maybe thats what we hear about is from organized approved day care centers   thats right thats right   but maybe we dont hear about the other ones though that could be you know the individual incidence or something   yeah umhum uh now usually when i have someone tend um my oldest tends for me now if i go somewhere but before   uhhuh how old is your oldest   hes almost a teenager  yeah hes hes very good um but um   oh well hes plenty big enough then   before that i would i would use uh kids from our church and they did a good job for me um   umhum um umhum umhum   but ive never had to leave them like in a day care center or anything and ive been very lucky just be able to stay home   umhum thats the way with me i i worked four years one time but but my last two children were uh both entering high school age   umhum   and uh they were of course gone while i was working working so it wasnt a problem i saw and i stayed home the rest of the time   yeah   i so i didnt have that problem either now i have my my oldest daughter she has two children and theyve been in day care uh she works full time   umhum yeah thats hard   it its difficult but yet shes the type of person that i dont know if shed be happy staying at home   well some people arent   uhhuh she uh she surprised me though shes done a lot of things that i never thought she would do you know with with the family because she   yeah   the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children  so she uh she spends a lot of quality time i think when she is with with the children   oh is that  is that right i think thats really important   and uh she theyve used the day care most of the time they tried once once they had a lady come in   umhum   and uh she she also had a small child she brought with her and it did not work out uh at all  it she thought it was going to she was real excited because it was so much easier than taking the children out in the morning but uh   uhhuh yeah uhhuh   uh the the lady called and her baby wasnt very old at the time and said she was having trouble and this baby is the is the most pleasant uh real pleasant baby easy to satisfy usually and and she was having problems with her and so she called and said things were okay settled down and was all right   yeah yeah   well my daughter decided to come and check and things werent okay   oh   her her one son was watching the soapies which she doesnt allow them to watch the soapies   oh umhum   and the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out   oh dear   and the babysitter was in the kitchen with her baby       and so that ended that  episode uh she was most upset over over   oh yeah   finding this   yeah i bet   so uh she they kind of had decided that the day care was better there is uh   umhum   more people involved more than one adult they and the age groups are separated and uh   well nannies have been an option uh but i know that at day care they have more of a a routine like at uh maybe in um preschool would have where they have lessons and so forth and so on   umhum hum yeah story time   uhhuh   uh and the this one has been particularly nice it uh it kept track of what they did and they would tell the parents what they did that day you know if they said anything or did anything so it kind of it   umhum   kept it   gave you an idea of what your child was progressing in or doing   yeah i often i always thought that if you were checking into a day care that you would be good to get references   yeah   uh on people that had been in that day care but was no longer there   yeah yeah   because they wouldnt have nothing to worry about saying you know if there was a problem they they would i think be more ready to tell you what it was   oh i think so because if they were still there you know they might not   they might not say anything   right right   and uh other than how else how do you judge other than from what others have uh what you see uh the cleanliness and that type of thing   you cant really you cant really unless your child would be old enough to say something and usually they arent at that age   uh umhum umhum   you know um   but it would be real difficult to pick you you know to find one and decide   uhhuh well i know i uh about three years ago i i tended some children   um   and uh you know i i wondered if i would have to be certified or wheth er theyd just bring them and and we got to where well we were just friends and so they said no dont do that well just bring them   umhum um umhum umhum   and then if it was a problem then then wed sit down and talk about it but it never happened to be a problem and and so things worked out okay and their kids played with my kids and it worked out well   umhum yeah yeah uh it worked out good im going to ive decided im going to babysit my two granddaughters   oh   since theyll be going back at the end of the month and   thats great   im going to give it a try i i i sell Avon and Stanley products and   oh uhhuh   ive got that worked out my husband hes retired so hes going to deliver my products so ill do my orders and that by phone   well thatll be great yeah   so uh ill be able to keep that up a little bit but i think i think ill enjoy   yeah i bet youll have some great experiences with them   doing it yeah i i think ill enjoy i i guess i kind of miss having a baby around  a kid around or something  yeah   yeah   sure why not and and you know the grandparents uh i always hear its always fun when you can send them home at the end of the day instead of   right thats right  well they do say you enjoy them more uh somebody somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun theyd of had them first   well thats right well uh my husbands mother lives right over here and she takes care of them sometimes for me and   uhhuh uhhuh   and just is a lovely lady and have always appreciated when shes sat with them   uhhuh yeah my daughter always said she would not let me babysit because you do hear grandparents complaining   and oh  uhhuh   you know because theyre stuck with their grandchildren so much   uhhuh   but theyre the ones that complain a lot are the first
