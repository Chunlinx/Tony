                                  Richard Posner            Richard Posner is a far more distinguished juristthan Thomas Penfield Jackson who chose him last week to mediateor attempt tomediatea settlement in the Microsoft case Jackson is a wellregardeddistrict court judge Posner is chief judge of the Seventh Circuit Court ofAppeals and the most prominent legal philosopher currently on the federalbench including the Supreme Court            So Jacksons choice is a gracious one but an oddone Posner is the high prophet of law and economics a school of thoughtthat derives legal principles from economic analysis typically pointing atsome established legal doctrine and declaring it nonsense No area of the lawhas been more affected by law and economics than antitrust Posner believesthat predatory pricing the monopolists act of cutting prices to killcompetition as Microsoft is alleged to have done by giving away its InternetExplorer browser can almost never exist He has argued for only the narrowestkinds of antitrust remedies in only the narrowest kinds of antitrust casesAsking Posner to mediate between Microsoft and the Justice Department is a bitlike asking Saddam Hussein to oversee elections in Iraq            But Posner cannot bepigeonholed as an antigovernment obsessive For one thing he has otherobsessions too As a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago Law Schoolhe teaches two seemingly irreconcilable courses Law and Economics and Lawand Literature He has authored more than  judicial decisions hundredsof articles and more than two dozen books including Sex and Reason Law and Literature  Aging and Old Age and most recently AnAffair of State The Investigation Impeachment and Trial of PresidentClinton  His take on the official report a splendid libretto byKenneth Starr a Greek chorus of television commentators  hapless walkonsclandestine comings and goings  a MayDecember romance            Some of Posners greatest intellectual disdain is reservedfor the internationalists multiculturalists environmentalists andsometimes vegetarians on the academic left He has little time for those whopity murderers and penguins and sea otters and harp seals more thanfetuses But Posners early rsum reads more like that of a vegetarian than alibertarian He clerked for liberal William Brennan on the US Supreme Courtin  at the height of Warren court activism and later worked at the JusticeDepartment under Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall            Posners explanation forhis change in perspective is disappointingly conventional He says he was putoff by the picketing sitins and violence he witnessed at Stanford whileteaching there in the late s In the spirit of law and economics we shouldcredit andor tar him with motives that are more intellectual andorselfinterested than that Whatever the cause the transition was complete by when Posner published his seminal Economic Analysis of Law shining the light of costbenefit analysis into every dark corner of the lawfrom antitrust to racial discrimination toof coursesex Reading Posner onany of these subjects makes it difficult to shake off the mental image of thebemused libertarian rooted to the sticky floor of his local Safeway fiendishlyapplying his costbenefit quadratics to the Charmin in one hand and White Cloudin the otherwhile myriad little Posners hop around at home praying for hisreturn            Ronald Reagan appointed Posner to the Seventh Circuit in and he started producing opinions like one in  declaring that aninjunction should be granted if P x Hp  P x Hd Not surprisinglycritics find Posners jurisprudence bloodless and ultimately cruel chasing thelogic of freemarket capitalism right off the edge of a cliff A notorious article suggested making it legal for parents to auction off their unwantedbabies to the highest bidders An essay on rape reads almost like a parody ofthe substitution of economic for moral reasoning Allowing rape would leadto heavy expenditures on protecting women as well as expenditures onovercoming those protections The expenditures would be offsetting and to thatextent socially wasted            A more appealing aspectof Posners philosophy is his belief that judges base their opinions onguesses and personal ideology while hiding behind a veil of precedent Heseeks as did Oliver Wendell Holmes to demystify what courts actually do Itis judicial humilityjudges have no access to transcendent moral truththatleads Posner to economics as a way to cut through legal indeterminacy Choosingnot to feel anyones pain he has quite literally found safety in numbersbecause they are in his view morally neutral where pain is not            In practice Posner is not so humble His appellateopinions contain long expository asides when he disagrees with the law ashanded down by the Supreme Court A  opinion in which he felt forced toapply an antitrust doctrine he disliked includes the snide observation ifthis is what the Supreme Court believesand it does appear to be the Courtscurrent position though not one that is easy to defend in terms of economictheory or antitrust policy  His expository aside was adopted as the law ofthe land by the Supreme Court in             An odd man and an oddchoice but possibly an inspired one as well After all the rights and wrongsof the Microsoft case are purely economic The government made none of thesociological arguments against large and powerful corporations that aresometimes part of the antitrust debate Has Microsofts behavior harmedconsumers economically by taking too much of their money or slowing the pace ofinnovation Is there a remedy that will do more good than harm            Posner cannot retry the facts or impose a result as amatter of law But who better to rationally and coldly lay out the costs andbenefits of settlement for both Microsoft and the Justice Department If Posnertells Microsoft that on this occasion the government has a point Microsoftwill be hard put to disagree And if Posner tells the government that whatevertortures it has in mind will do more harm than good the government will haveto listen hard            Who better to strip away the hubris and slipperymoralizing of both sides in this case than the man who really can distillconsumer harm down to a decimal point Like a Vegas bookmaker or a seasonedactuary Posner will spit out a number at the end of these negotiations andlike a Pentium processors Posners number will be right Microsoft andJustice can choose to listen to his advice or disregard it But they wont beable to say they werent helped with their math homework by the very best
