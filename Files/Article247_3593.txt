appropriations bills favoring specific universitiesreferred incompletely to the source of the  million figure which is thisyears total for such funds Now reading that wouldnt you think the originalstory said something about that source Well it didnt That figure wascalculated by The Chronicle of Higher Education in its own story on thetopic but in the August  Times story the  million appearsunattributed in the second paragraph and the Chronicle shows up in thefourteenth and without being connected to the figure Hence todays newspaperdeconstruction referred incompletely to the source means referred to thesource without mentioning that it was the source These baroque newspapercorrections are to a mistake what a combover is to baldness
