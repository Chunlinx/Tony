                    Background        An emerging pattern found in gene and protein        phylogenies that include prokaryotes archaebacteria and        eubacteria and eukaryotes is the variable position of        eukaryotes In proteins involved in transcription and        translation eukaryotes often cluster with archaebacteria        whereas in metabolic proteins they often cluster with        eubacteria     Among the latter proteins eukaryotes        sometimes group with proteobacteria presumably        reflecting the origin of mitochondria and plants sometimes        cluster with cyanobacteria reflecting the origin of        plastids These patterns have been interpreted as a general        signature of the symbiotic origin of eukaryotes     and        horizontal gene transfer HGT of symbiont genes to the        nucleus          On the one hand this complexity        resulting from HGT can obscure some aspects of evolutionary        history     However HGT also can provide the means to        investigate otherwise difficult questions such as        inferring the number of symbiotic events and estimating the        time of those events This is the approach that we take in        this study        The goal of this study is to estimate the timing of        evolutionary events involved in the origin of eukaryotes        Fig  including the related origin of oxygenic        photosynthesis The latter is believed to have occurred        only in cyanobacteria    and preceded the symbiotic        event leading to the mitochondrion of eukaryotes The        earliest biomarker evidence of eukaryotes is at  Ga           and the earliest fossils appear  Ga     The        fossil record of cyanobacteria has been argued to extend to         Ga    but the biomarker evidence at  Ga            usually is considered to be the earliest record of        cyanobacteria     However the methylhopane        biomarker of cyanobacteria has been detected in lower        abundance in other prokaryotes and many taxa especially        anaerobic species have not been examined for the biomarker              Also the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis        may have occurred at some time later than the origin of        cyanobacteria Geologic evidence bearing on the origin and        rise in oxygen likewise has been debated             Although the existence of banded iron formations prior to         Ga sometimes has been used as evidence for the early        evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis oxygenindependent        mechanisms of iron deposition are known            The use of sequence changes to estimate the time of        these early events also has its assumptions and limitations              Nonetheless many proteins contain conserved        regions of amino acid sequence throughout prokaryotes and        eukaryotes that permit alignment and analysis The most        extensive of these analyses have found that all major        events related to the origin of eukaryotes occurred about         Ga      This includes the divergence of        archaebacteria and archaebacterial proteins in eukaryotes        the origin of cyanobacteria and the divergence of        eubacteria and eubacterial proteins in eukaryotes the        latter presumably reflecting symbiosis However these        times were not adjusted for lineagespecific rate        differences that have been discovered subsequently            Here we estimate the time of these events with protein        sequences from complete genomes and consideration of        lineagespecific rate variation                    Results                  Rate differences          The shape parameter  of the gamma distribution used          to account for rate variation among sites was found to          differ consistently between calibration taxa and the          overall data set for each gene Fig  requiring a          dualgamma approach see Methods Also eukaryotic          protein sequences were found to have an increased rate of          evolution compared with prokaryotic sequences regardless          of their archaebacterial or eubacterial origin Fig A          Average eukaryote rates were  AK  BKo and           BKm times the rate of the most closely related          prokaryote in constant rate proteins   and           in all proteins respectively Besides this general          pattern which may reflect fundamental differences          between prokaryotes and eukaryotes eg recombination          there are further differences among eukaryotes In          comparing rates of evolution in eukaryotic sequences          derived independently from eubacteria and archaebacteria          in the same protein those derived from eubacteria in          all cases BKo were found to be evolving at roughly          twice the rate as their archaebacteriaderived          counterparts Fig B The slope was  and the          correlation coefficient was  n   comparisons in          seven proteins          Two other rate comparisons were limited by a small          number of proteins eubacteria versus eukaryotes K           A  and eubacteria versus          archaebacteria Only three proteins were available in the          first comparison and all three showed a faster rate in          eukaryotes    x   This result          differs from that reported elsewhere     in which          the two rates were not significantly different In the          second case we found that archaebacteria are evolving at          a slower rate than eubacteria as was noted elsewhere              In our case regression of archaebacterial branch          length versus eubacterial branch length fixed through          the origin resulted in a slope of  and correlation          coefficient of  n   proteins However in both of          these comparisons rate tests did not yield significant          rate differences probably because of the short length of          most proteins Sample size eight protein sets also was          limited in the Kollman and Doolittle study     Taken          together these data suggest the following relative order          of rate differences archaebacteria  eubacteria           eukaryotes archaebacterial origin  eukaryotes          eubacterial origin As additional genomic data become          available more proteins will be useful and greater          precision in these rates and rate differences will be          possible                          Phylogeny and time estimation          It has been suggested that eukaryotic genes and          proteins of archaebacterial origin are more closely          related to one lineage of archaebacteria Crenarchaeota          eocytes than the other major lineage Euryarchaeota              If true this would bear on our time estimate for          the divergence of archaebacteria and eukaryotes Thus we          conducted a phylogenetic analysis of  proteins          containing representatives of the two major groups of          archaebacteria eukaryotes and eubacteria At the           bootstrap significance level  proteins supported          archaebacterial monophyly whereas none supported the          eocyte hypothesis Crenarchaeota  Eukaryota This          indicates that the lineage of archaebacteria leading to          the eukaryote nuclear genome diverged prior to the split          between the Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota As noted          previously     most in this case  out of           eukaryotic proteins with archaebacterial affinity are          informational involved in transcription translation          and related processes          Among  eukaryotic proteins with eubacterial          affinities           Rickettsia is most closely related          to eukaryotes in phylogenetic analyses of nine individual          proteins This agrees with the genetic and cell          biological evidence implicating an proteobacterium as          progenitor of the mitochondrion    and supports the          hypothesis that these nine eukaryotic proteins owe their          origin to that symbiotic event     However the          remaining  proteins do not show this pattern but          instead identify other species or groups of eubacteria as          closest relative Unlike           Rickettsia  no other single          species appears as closest relative in more than three          proteins but rather most  proteins identify          groups of species as closest relative eg Fig A To          further explore this question we combined sequences of          all  proteins with a full representation of eubacterial          taxa  species In the combined analysis eukaryotes          fall significantly outside of the welldefined clade          containing  and proteobacteria Fig B The          relatively basal and unresolved position of eukaryotes is          consistent with the preponderance of single proteins          showing different groups of species as closest relative          Three individual proteins showed significant bootstrap          support for a           Rickettsia eukaryote cluster in          fourtaxon analyses rooted with an archaebacterium          whereas four proteins significantly supported a           RickettsiaEscherichia cluster that          excluded the eukaryote          Divergence time estimates from the multigene MG and          average distance AD approaches are similar but          rateadjusted times are older than unadjusted times          Table  The time estimate for the AK divergence          averages  Ga and the remaining times range from  to           Ga The time estimate for BKo    Ga was          older than the estimate for BKm    Ga whereas          the time estimate for the origin of Giardia             Ga was intermediate The BC time estimate was             Ga                            Discussion        The purpose of this study was to examine the temporal        relationship between the origin of eukaryotes and events in        Earth history However some unexpected results required        refinement in methodology These included finding greater        amongsite rate variation in the calibration group and        different rates of sequence change between prokaryotes and        eukaryotes and between eukaryotes derived from different        groups of prokaryotes By taking into account these        variables the resulting time estimates are more robust and        have fewer assumptions For example the time estimate for        the origin of eukaryotes BKo is not based on a general        assumption of rate constancy between prokaryotes or even        eubacteria and eukaryotes because rates are adjusted for        each protein and each comparison Also the calibration        used for BKo is not a general eukaryotic calibration but        one based exclusively on eukaryote sequences derived from        eubacteria A tradeoff in these improved methods was a        reduction in the number of proteins that could be used        which increased the variance of the time estimates        Nonetheless the phylogenies and time estimates obtained in        this study have a bearing on current models for the        evolution of eukaryotes        Until about five years ago it was generally accepted        that there was a prior period before mitochondria in the        history of eukaryotes      The basal position of        eukaryotes lacking mitochondria amitochondriate in        phylogenetic trees    was consistent with this        supposition as was evidence from sequence signatures            However molecular phylogenetic studies of several        proteins in recent years have suggested that some or all        amitochondriate eukaryotes once possessed mitochondria in        the past     Based on this new evidence most current        models for the origin of eukaryotes assume only a single        symbiotic or fusion event between an archaebacterium and an        proteobacterium              Under the singlesymbiosis model eukaryotes should        cluster exclusively with an proteobacterium eg         Rickettsia  among eubacteria        However our phylogenetic analyses Fig  instead        indicate significantly that many eukaryotic proteins        originated from one or more eubacterial lineages other        than proteobacteria The reduced genome of         Rickettsia    would not explain        this result because         Rickettsia possesses all of the        proteins used in the combined analysis Fig B Protein        function and location also are consistent with a        premitochondrial origin Only one of the  BKo proteins        is restricted to the mitochondrion whereas eight of the        nine BKm proteins are restricted to that organelle Also        all six of the proteins involved in cellular respiration        are in the BKm group Based on the serial endosymbiosis        theory the first symbiotic event involved a spirochete            On the other hand sequence signatures of the heat        shock molecular chaperone protein HSP and other evidence        have indicated that the first symbiotic event involved a        gramnegative eubacterium     Our data are unable to        distinguish between these two alternatives but agree with        both in implicating an earlier premitochondrial event        Predation by prokaryotes on early eukaryotes also may have        led to HGT        If two or more symbiotic events were involved this does        not necessarily confirm that any of the living lineages of        amitochondriate eukaryotes arose prior to the second        mitochondrial event All may have once possessed        mitochondria However because         Giardia arose at an early time Table         and branches near the base of the eukaryote phylogeny        the simplest explanation is that it never possessed        mitochondria and is a primary not secondary        amitochondriate Although the position of         Giardia in some protein phylogenies           has been proposed as evidence that it is a secondary        amitochondriate others have urged caution until        additional more conclusive data become available                   The number of symbiotic events was important for our        primary concern of estimating a timescale for the early        evolution of eukaryotes We find that the divergence        between archaebacteria and the lineage leading to        eukaryotes K         A  was quite early  Ga which is        about the time of the earliest biomarker evidence of life         Ga     We interpret that divergence to be a        speciation event between two lineages of archaebacteria        with K         A not becoming eukaryotic until the        first symbiotic event at  Ga The remaining time        estimates cluster around the midlife of Earth         Ga The order of those events falls in a logical sequence        BKo BC and BKm For example the origin of mitochondria        appears as the second not first symbiotic event and the        origin of cyanobacteria comes before the oxygenutilizing        organelles mitochondria Moreover the timing of these        biological events is consistent with the timing of events        in geologic and atmospheric history Fig  Cyanobacteria        appear before the major undisputed evidence of the rise        in oxygen  Ga and mitochondria appear after the        rise in oxygen Also the estimates for the origin of        cyanobacteria and eukaryotes are consistent within one SE        with the earliest biomarker evidence for those two groups         Ga      Phylogenetic analyses of        photosynthetic genes and sequence signatures also support a        relatively late order of appearance of cyanobacteria among        photosynthetic prokaryotes             Extensive glaciations occurred in the Paleoproterozoic         Ga and may have been global in extent     It        has been proposed that a major rise in oxygen at this time        lowered global temperatures and may have triggered the        glaciations     If this is true and given the time        estimates here the evolutionary innovation of oxygenic        photosynthesis may have had a relatively rapid impact on        the environment Moreover this innovation may have caused        a mass extinction of prokaryotes at that time as a result        of the toxic effects of oxygen as suggested by the virtual        absence of lineages prior to  Ga and subsequent rapid        radiation of lineages Figs                      Conclusions        Our analyses of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomic        sequence data support two symbiotic events in the origin of        eukaryotes one premitochondrial  billion years ago        Ga and a later mitochondrial event  Ga Our time        estimate for the divergence of an earlybranching eukaryote                 Giardia  that lacks mitochondria         Ga suggests that it is a primary and not secondary        amitochondriate organism Our time estimate for the origin        of cyanobacteria  Ga is more recent than expected and        suggests that earlier fossils claimed to be of        cyanobacteria are of other organisms or artifacts        Moreover the appearance of cyanobacteria immediately prior        to the earliest undisputed evidence for the presence of        oxygen  Ga suggests that the innovation of        oxygenic photosynthesis had a relatively rapid impact on        the environment as it set the stage for further evolution        of the eukaryotic cell                    Materials and Methods                  Sequence data and alignment          We assembled and aligned protein sequences of all           potentially orthologous groups from complete genome          databases and these were supplemented with additional          eukaryote taxa from the sequence database of the National          Center for Biotechnology Information          httpwwwncbinlmnihgoventrez Data from the          following species were assembled into

  Xenopus laevis Eukaryota The          genome sequence of           Aeropyrum pernix Archaebacteria          Crenarchaeota became available during completion of          study and was included in phylogenetic analyses only          Global alignment algorithms differ from local          alignment algorithms in that they sometimes align          unrelated nonhomologous sites together with homologous          sites Using a computational tool xcons     such          unrelated sites were removed from these CLUSTALW             alignments to increase probability of site homology          During construction of protein alignments using the WAT          system     short fragmented sequences were manually          removed Of the  proteins that could be calibrated for          time estimation the orthology of roughly half           proteins was ambiguous for unknown reasons eg          lateral gene transfer gene loss or poor phylogenetic          resolution leaving  proteins for phylogeny and time          estimation The seven shortest  amino acids of          those were used only in phylogenetic analyses the          remaining proteins averaged  amino acids each Where          possible proteins were rooted by duplicate proteins          duplicate genes otherwise they were          midpointrooted          Separately for timing the origin of           Giardia  sequences of  proteins          were obtained from the public databases and aligned             in which the following taxa were available           Giardia and other eukaryotes          including calibration taxa

follows Our initial goal was to estimate divergence          times for the last common ancestor LCA the divergence          between archaebacteria and eukaryotes AK cyanobacteria          and closest eubacterial relatives origin of          cyanobacteria BC eubacteria and mitochondrial          eukaryotes origin of mitochondria BKm and           Giardia and other eukaryotes GK          Fig  The importance of           Giardia is its lack of mitochondria          and basal location in many phylogenies of eukaryotes                        However our initial phylogenetic analyses revealed          that many eukaryotes did not cluster with           Rickettsia the proteobacterium          as predicted by current genomic models               Instead they typically formed a basal lineage among          eubacteria in the tree This result was consistent with          the serial endosymbiosis theory    and with other          findings    and therefore we designated this          divergence as BKo origin of eukaryotes Estimation of          the divergence time of the origin of plastids BKp was          not a goal of this study and the LCA was not estimated          because of an insufficient number of duplicate proteins          needed for reciprocal rooting     Thus five          divergence times were studied AK BC BKo BKm and          GK Eukaryotes derived from different prokaryotes are          referred to herein as K           A from AK K           Bo from BKo and K           Bm from BKm          Because of the large amount of sequence conservation          in these proteins it was not possible to calibrate          directly by extrapolation from vertebrates     for          which an extensive fossil record exists For example          sequences often were identical among rodents primates          and birds Instead multiple calibrations were used from          older divergences among kingdoms plants animals fungi          and animal phyla derived from analysis of  nuclear          proteins calibrated with the vertebrate fossil record              This twostep calibration reduced the error          involved in extrapolation Two classes of time estimation          methods were used and compared The multigene MG          approach uses the mean or mode of many singlegene time          estimates     whereas the averagedistance AD          approach      involves the combining of distances          and rates among genes or proteins to yield a single time          estimate For the AD approach we weight each singlegene          distance before combining by the length of the protein          aligned amino acids          Proteinspecific rates were estimated by regression          fixed through the origin of these calibration points          within eukaryotes arthropodchordate  Ga          chordatenematode  Ga and plantanimalfungi           Ga     During the course of the study it          was discovered that the shape parameter  of the gamma          distribution used to account for rate variation among          sites estimated by a likelihood method     differed          consistently between calibration taxa average  and          the overall data set  for each gene Fig           Therefore a dualgamma approach was taken whereby the          eukaryote rate was estimated using the eukaryote gamma          parameter and the time estimate involving prokaryotes          was made using the overall gamma parameter There is          insufficient evidence at present to determine whether or          not this difference is biologically based related to the          covarion model     or follows a simple scaling          relationship with time or total protein distance If the          relationship is scaled additional modification in          methods may be necessary in the future          We compared rates of change in archaebacterial versus          eubacterial sequences using paralogous sequences those          related by gene duplication as a root for relative rate          tests      To examine rate differences between          eukaryotic sequences and their closest prokaryote          orthologs those representing the same gene we used the          more distant prokaryote archaebacteria or eubacteria as          root For examining rates in eukaryotic sequences derived          from either archaebacteria or eubacteria we compared          pairwise distances of the same taxa present in both          locations eg one pair clustering with archaebacteria          and the other with eubacteria in the same protein The          discovery of rate differences among prokaryotes and          eukaryotes required rate adjustments for all proteins and          comparisons including those accepted in rate tests          These adjustments were made by estimating time only with          the eukaryote lineage or in the case of BC using a          cyanobacterial rate adjusted by direct comparison of the          cyanobacteria branch and eukaryote branch in rate tests          For example the AK divergence time was estimated only          with the K           A calibration and the BC BKo and          BKm divergence times were estimated only with the K           Bo calibration These restrictions          further reduced the number of proteins available for time          estimation to the following AK  total           constantrate BKo   BKm   BC            and           Giardia eukaryotes            Modes were used in the MG approach as described          previously     except with the BKm comparison where          the median was used because of the small number of          proteins The mode is preferred over the mean or median          because it eliminates or reduces the effect of outliers          eg unusually high estimates resulting from paralogous          comparisons In this study a large number of          overlapping bins was used initially to better define the          distribution of time estimates followed by use of a          smaller number of nonoverlapping bins and standard          estimation of mode by interpolation This twostep          procedure was found to reduce the influence of bin size          on mode estimation For the AD approach singlegene          distances and rates were weighted by sequence length and          then combined distances were divided by combined          rates                          Phylogeny estimation          Phylogenetic trees    were constructed for each          gene from amino acid data to assist in gene selection and          interpretation A gamma distance was used for all trees          with  estimated from the entire data set     An          analysis involving combined protein alignments was          performed with maximum likelihood     neighbor          joining      and maximum parsimony     using          bootstrapping Bootstrap consensus trees show          branchlengths estimated by ordinary leastsquares method              Bootstrap support   was considered          significant
