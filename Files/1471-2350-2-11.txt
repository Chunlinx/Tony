                    Background        The Marfan syndrome MFS is an autosomal dominant        connective tissue disorder with an estimated incidence of         in  live births     Besides the classic        manifestations in the cardiovascular ocular and        musculoskeletal systems frequent features include        spontaneous pneumothorax inguinal herniae striae        atrophicae in the skin and lumbosacral dural ectasia There        is pronounced inter and intrafamilial variability Age of        onset and progression of the various manifestations cover a        wide range             The MFS phenotype is the result of mutations in         FBN a large gene composed of         exons encoding the  kD fibrillin protein that is the        major constituent of microfibrils in the extracellular        matrix reviewed in     To date  unique         FBN mutations have been identified        including   cysteine substitutions          other missense mutations   premature termination        mutations   exon skipping mutations and  other        mutations as listed in the Human Gene Mutation Database        HGMD        httparchiveuwcmacukuwcmmgsearchhtml           and reported more recently     Although the         FBN gene including three        alternatively spliced  untranslated exons    extends        over  kb of genomic DNA in chromosome band q        httpgenomecseucscedu no major deletions have been        identified except for one report of an exon  genomic        deletion     Some correlations between         FBN mutation genotypes and        phenotypes are emerging For example exonskipping        mutations in the central region of the gene exons         cause severe phenotypes or neonatal presentations            But there are exceptions only four of the many other        mutations in this region cause severe phenotypes while one        mutation predicted to lead to skipping of exon  was found        in a patient with classic MFS     In contrast most        cysteine substitutions cause classic MFS with a high        frequency of lens dislocation although some patients in        our study did not meet the Ghent criteria for diagnosis of        MFS     Aminoacid substitutions not disrupting        disulfide bonds may be associated with fibrillinopathies        other than MFS although mutations in the calciumbinding        consensus sequence have been reported in individuals with        classic MFS        It is clear from the studies        reported so far that genotypephenotype correlations are        not straightforward for         FBN mutations        We report here two multiexon deletion mutations of         FBN  We located the deletion        breakpoints in introns and characterized the mutant RNA and        protein phenotypes Partial deletion of an cysteine        LTBPlike domain and loss of the downstream cysteine        calciumbinding cb epidermal growth factor EGFlike        domain caused protein instability and classic MFS         De novo deletion of three cbEGFlike        domains encoded by exons  resulted in a severe form of        MFS diagnosed in infancy Both mutations lead to the        synthesis of mutant FBN proteins that interfere with        microfibril assembly resulting in significantly reduced        extracellular matrix microfibrils                    Patients and Methods                  Clinical

distinguished by SSCA and silver staining according to          the protocol provided by the manufacturer Bio Rad          Hercules CA and were subsequently quantified by          scanning

       insoluble fraction representing the labeled fibrillin in          the extracellular matrix were fractionated by SDS          polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiographed          Labeled fibrillin was identified and quantified as          described      More recently the results were          replicated by use of a phosphorimager The levels of          fibrillin production and deposition in the          extracellular matrix were expressed as the percentage of          values obtained for simultaneously studied normal control          fibroblast cultures                            Results and Discussion        We developed a long RTPCR approach to screen for        exonskipping and large deletion mutations in the         FBN gene PCR with three sets of        primer pairs amplifies overlapping fragments exons            bp exons     bp and exons            bp from skin fibroblastderived total RNA The amplicons        are digested with restriction enzymes that generate        individually recognizable fragments with known sequence        content A total of  patients were screened with this        method  of which met diagnostic criteria for MFS and         had partial manifestations All of these skin fibroblast        samples had previously been screened with a cDNA        amplificationSSCA protocol    and a genomic DNAexon        amplification method    with negative results As        reported previously the long RTPCR method identified six        samples with transcripts skipping exons             or  that were caused by nucleotide substitutions at        splice sites     In another patient skipping of exon         was discovered to be due to a silent mutation within the        exon possibly affecting a splicing enhancer binding site            Here we report abnormal fragments seen after         Taq I digestion of the exon         amplicons Fig a Sequence analysis of the altered cDNA        fragments revealed a deletion of exons  and  in patient         and a deletion of exons  in patient  Fig b        In both cases we found no evidence for sequence        alterations when we amplified the deleted and flanking        exons and their splice sites individually from genomic DNA        data not shown Therefore we suspected that these normal        amplification products were derived from the normal         FBN alleles and that the mutant        alleles were not amplified by this approach because they        carry gross genomic deletions To test this hypothesis        primer pairs were designed from the flanking exon sequences        for amplification of genomic DNA Longrange PCR analysis        revealed genomic deletions about  kb in size in both        patients Fig  For Case  P a  kb amplicon was        obtained instead of the  kb amplicon in the normal control        sample For Case  P a  kb product was amplified        instead of the  kb product in the normal control In        both cases the PCR conditions used favored the        amplification of the shorter mutant fragment although        the normal allele was also present in the genomic PCR        template Fig  Direct sequencing of the deletion        junction amplicons revealed the location of the intronic        breakpoints Both deletion events generated clean junctions        with no missing or inserted nucleotides In Case  the        breakpoints are about  nt downstream from exons  and         while in Case  they are located about  nt upstream        of exons  and  In Case  two sets of identical        pentamers cagta and ggaaa were identified near the        breakpoints in introns  and  In Case  the exchange        occurred within an identical pentamer atttt Fig         None of these sequences are known to predispose to genomic        rearrangements although short stretches of identical        sequence are often found at the sites of germline        translocation and deletion breakpoints              Genomic analysis of the parents and siblings of Case         indicated that the mutation was sporadic Although the        parents of Case  were not available for study the        negative family history suggests that this deletion is also                de novo Slightly advanced paternal        age  yr and  yr respectively may be a factor in both        cases        The effects of the two deletions were studied at the        protein level by Scysteine pulsechase analysis Both        mutant mRNAs encode internally deleted proteins without a        frameshift In Case  with del exons  fibrillin        synthesis was normal  of control indicating that the        mutant fibrillin molecules are stable The mutant protein        band expected to be  amino acids shorter was not        resolved on our gel system The deposition of newly        synthesized fibrillin into the matrix was greatly reduced          of normal however suggesting that the internally        deleted mutant fibrillin molecules are secreted and exert        a dominantnegative effect on extracellular microfibril        assembly        In Patient  the inframe deletion of exons         removed the Cterminal  amino acids of the  thLTBP        cysteine domain and the adjacent  thcalciumbinding        EGFlike domain Fibrillin synthesis levels were  of        control and in addition matrix deposition was        disproportionately reduced to  of control Fig A An        earlier independent study of this patients fibroblasts had        revealed similar results  for synthesis and  for        deposition T Aoyama unpublished data To determine        whether the low value for synthesis was due to reduced        mutant transcript levels we made use of the         Rsa I restriction site polymorphism        in the         FBN UTR for which the patient is        heterozygous The SSCA patterns of         Rsa I digested RTPCR products were        indistinguishable from controls indicating that transcript        levels were equal for both alleles Fig B This leads us        to conclude that the mutant mRNA is stable but that the        mutant protein containing a partially deleted LTBPdomain        if synthesized is unstable and may be processed to smaller        fragments by proteolytic cleavage The methods we used did        not allow us to detect such hypothetical proteolytic        fragments        Of more than          FBN mutations reported only one is        a multiexon deletion     It involves deletion of exons         encoding three contiguous cbEGFlike domains            This deletion cosegregated with affected status in a        generation family Skeletal involvement was characterized        by a moderate Marfanoid habitus with mild scoliosis and        hypermobility of large and small joints Ectopia lentis was        absent Retinal detachment was reported in one individual        Cardiovascular features included aortic dilatation in        midlife one case of dissection at age  yr and a high        frequency of mitral valve prolapse associated with        arrhythmia Immunoprecipitation studies with        fibrillinspecific antibodies revealed the presence of a         kDsmaller mutant polypeptide in the medium of        metabolically labeled mutant fibroblasts     The        shortened molecule was incorporated into the extracellular        matrix and apparently caused major disruptions of        microfibrils            Patient  described here also has a deletion of three        contiguous cbEGFlike domains those encoded by exons         This deletion resulted in a more severe phenotype        with onset in infancy and a rapidly progressing clinical        course Thus it appears that deletion of three contiguous        EGFlike domains can have different effects depending on        their location within the fibrillin molecule Deletion of        the EGFlike domains encoded by exons  in the        Cterminal domain of fibrillin results in a much less        severe phenotype than deletion of three EGFlike domains in        the second longest stretch of EGFlike domains between        exons  It has been reported that  of mutations        identified in the region between exons  but only         of mutations in other regions were associated with mild        Marfanlike phenotypes     Our results are in line        with the notion of this general genotypephenotype        correlation        Deletion of one EGFlike domain due to exon skipping        especially in the region between exon  and  usually        causes severe neonatalonset MFS       Similar        deletions in other regions of fibrillin may also result        in early onset of cardiovascular symptoms     Patient         described here had a genomic deletion of exons  and         that results in an inframe deletion of part of the th        LTBPlike domain and the adjacent downstream cbEGFlike        domain Diagnosed as a teenager patient  had the skeletal        and skin findings of MFS bilateral dislocated lenses and        at the age of  yr a mildly dilated aortic root In        contrast to the cases with deleted EGFlike domains her        mutant protein was unstable We obtained a similar result        in a case of exon  skipping due to a silent CT        transition at a CpG dinucleotide     Inframe deletion        of exon  removes  amino acids of the  thLTBPlike        domain In this patients fibroblasts fibrillin synthesis        was  of control and deposition was reduced to  while        the mutant mRNA level was normal as shown here in Fig         In addition we found that certain cysteine substitutions        in EGFlike domains and located immediately Nterminal of        LTBPlike domains cause protein instability and greatly        reduced matrix deposition     Taken together our data        support a model in which misfolding or partial deletion of        LTBPlike domains results in proteolytic cleavage of the        mutant fibrillin molecules We hypothesize that truncated        intermediates interfere with microfibril assembly and        thus produce the low levels of matrix deposition observed        This hypothesis is not only based on analysis of Case         reported here but on a similar analysis of five previously        reported cases one with exon  skipping    and four        with cysteine substitutions immediately Nterminal of the        LTBP like domains     It is also possible however        that proteolytic fragments of the mutant protein associate        with the normal length fibrillin molecules and inhibit        their secretion Future focused mechanistic studies are        needed to test our hypothesis        The FBN mutation detection rate for individuals with        clinically diagnosed MFS is currently about  when the        gene is completely screened with a DNAbased PCR        amplification protocol of individual exons             Genomic deletions such as the ones reported here are not a        frequent cause of human disease and would be missed by this        approach To search for additional large genomic        rearrangements we carried out Southern analyses of         BamH I         Sac I and         Bgl II digested genomic DNA from         fibroblasts strains that were negative for         FBN mutation screening by other        methods but had shown abnormal fibrillin biosynthetic        profiles by pulsechase analysis The blots were hybridized        successively with the three overlapping longrange RTPCR        fragments covering the FBN coding region that were        generated from a normal cDNA template as described above        While we identified several restriction fragment length        polymorphisms no evidence for major deletions or        rearrangements was found data not shown Thus we have        only detected two genomic deletions out of  unique        diseasecausing FBN mutations identified in our        laboratory The Human Gene Mutation Database as of         contains  unique mutations in  genes        Of those   are gross deletions        httparchiveuwcmacukuwcmmghgmdhtml           suggesting that more FBN genomic deletions await        recognition Multiexon deletions are easily detected with        the long RTPCR method we used here that requires RNA from        fibroblast cultures while Southern blot analyses of        genomic DNA are much more laborious and more difficult to        interpret Whereas most published genotypephenotype        correlation studies compare the nucleotide changes at the        DNA level with the list of phenotypic features we feel        strongly that studies of the mutant alleles at the RNA and        protein level are necessary to take some of the guesswork        out of these
