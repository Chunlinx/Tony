        what kind of car are you driving now     no im well driving a Hyundai Sonata   uhhuh do you like that one   no we like it real well   uhhuh   yeah we havent had the only problem weve had is the valve cover gasket leaking other than that its been working real good   how long have you had it   uh two years   uhhuh my car that was the main problem ive ever had with it is i guess twice ive had to get the valve cover gasket replaced and once the gasket around the the um oil pan   umhum   its uh nineteen eighty two Cutlass Sierra and it still drives pretty well though i had kind of low mileage on it   yeah well this um like i said weve had this for two years and it almost got forty five thousand on it   wow thats a lot of driving   yeah wife does a lot of driving  she she uses it a lot and then we have the second vehicle the Nissan pickup   uhhuh i think that um i mightve done better to get a pickup for the use that ive put mine to       but um i didnt get it i didnt get that i got a car and thats there have been times when i was glad to have a car but most of the stuff ive done has been hauling around and ive been better off to have a pickup   yeah well our next vehicle is going to be a a full size truck well were kind of getting little   a full size pickup   yeah uh Nissan is just a a mini truck   umhum   and its not real big for a family so   right what do you think youll get a um step side or a a smooth split side   ill probably get a fleet side   yeah my daddy use used to always get a step side and because he has cows and the cows he can with a step side you can haul cows in the back because there arent those humps for the tires   yeah   but this last time he decided to still get a step side even though he couldnt find a step side in the long full length they only had them in the short length   yeah thats thats all they make them in now i think     so he was disappointed in that but he still went with the step side because he thought it was easier to get in and around it and take things off the truck and so on without always having to come out the back   yeah   but he uses it on the farm and he built himself a cow trailer so it he didnt need the length so much anymore   yeah yeah yeah like i say like im were kind of moving out in a mini truck and into the full size will be the next one so   do you just use it for your own purposes and hauling your family around   oh yeah plus you know i help friends move here and there and stuff and we kind of getting to the point where its its were going to do a lot of camping and stuff during the summertime and the mini truck just doesnt  work very well so   right do you have if youre going to go camping are you going to have to drive you car to take your family camping plus drive the truck   oh no no um the what wed probably do right now is just use the car and try to put everything in it that we can   right   and then later on were going to try to get a uh camper trailer once we buy a new truck   well even though i couldve probably used a truck better the last time around i probably will still get a car the next time around figuring thatll be more useful in the future   yeah   so i dont know ill probably look for something that has a       dealer everywhere i would like to drive   oh yeah i can understand that   thatll be the main criterion   yeah   i guess the Japanese makes though do are starting to have dealers all over though i dont know about how the Hyundai dealer network is   well its pretty good uh we had one and then he closed and now we got another one here right near us so   umhum   its its all right uh like i said the only problem we really had with our car just a valve cover gasket leaking and since they fixed it under warranty it was we havent had any problem with it   thats true thats a good point i remember a long time ago my folks got a Chrysler but the nearest Chrysler Chrysler dealer to them was over fifty miles away   yeah   and it werent all that good of a car they had pretty many trouble with it   umhum   pretty much trouble so whenever it would break down and take it back to the dealer theyd have to to nurse it along
