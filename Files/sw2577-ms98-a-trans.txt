                uh  several years ago my very best friend moved to back to Grand Island Nebraska and we had ridden bicycles and it was bothering my knees that spring and we have lots of wind in Indiana and i thought oh shoot ill just walk to town and i guess that probably started me on a career because i walk a lot in fact its a part of my life every day i walk at least two miles uh as a side effect i noticed that i was firming up so i thought well gosh maybe if i diet you know this might be work out real well so i ended up losing about thirty five pounds that spring and summer and i had not thought of myself as a fat person and people would say to me gosh i didnt you know   well thats great   youre really skinny whered this weight go well evidently i had some weight that i could afford to lose because im certainly not skinny now but i guess everything just shook into place so       walking uh is very much a part of my life and since my husbands retirement he has also started walking with me and i guess id have to say its a part of both of our lives and we just recommend it to anyone wholl listen to us   oh i dont blame you walking is uh you know its interesting because i think we went through a a phase there where it was jogging       everybody should jog you should get out you should jog and then i started hearing about well im not able to jog because im i have asthma and um   well yeah uhhuh   uh but i did like to walk and my neighbor and i get out wed walk and walk and uh unfortunately we havent done it well ive been in class until its like seven thirty at night and she having is having a flare up of arthritis and we havent done it for in about a month   uhhuh umhum   now and oh gosh do i notice a difference   umhum well i was at the point where if i hadnt gotten my walk in i was a real grouch that day   umhum   and uh a friend gave me this Prevention walking magazine a year ago at Christmas time and they recommend that you only walk five times a week that you do not walk every day but for me the days that i dont im not much fun to be around   oh neat right   well you know now walking relieves a lot of tension and its a good way to work off vent frustration and things like this i i cant i think   sure   uh uh it depends on how far you walk how many days a week   umhum   you know if you if youre walking ten miles  you know seven days a week maybe that uh has some effect but uh i think if youre not walking how many just out of curiosity how many miles do you usually walk   at least two   uhhuh well you see now thats what i do and um but that thats just about enough and uh uh i mean not that i wouldnt like to walk more but uh um ive   umhum uhhuh   i am a widow so uh and i have a handicapped son so i have to really set my priorities of what you know but this is one thing that i do enjoy very much doing   umhum umhum   and uh so but you know i have tried aerobics and i have trouble with that uh   ah i jig when they jog   yeah i know i i cant   i just cant keep and uh the jogging was never for me because my knees are not i just dont think they could stand that so   no right well i i have trouble right well i have trouble with one too in fact sometimes if i even just twist wrong my kneecap will pop off so you know um walking seems to be the one and it it really seems to be   umhum um   the most beneficial all the way around it gets your circulation going good it uh uh   umhum   um it seems to have so many other benefits you know besides just the exercise   um uh were golfers also uh have you done that   well uh no my when my husband was living he tried to get he loved to golf he was the avid golfer i used to go with him but only to uh uh   umhum   be caddy because um i have a very severe perceptual problem and uh i tried it a few time but uh i cant get you you have to make it down to the hole   um yes   in in six or seven times you know and when it get more than that and uh so i just   yeah   it went out for the walk with him and enjoyed you know uh pushing the cart or pulling it or whatever you know  but that is thats great my stepfather is seventy four and he goes golfing every day   umhum umhum umhum i think thats the beauty of the game that we its its a sport that we can participate in as we sink into the sunset so to speak and of course here in Indiana the weather limits us   umhum   quite a bit our golf season will start and then stop due to weather and then start we had a   right sure   last weekend it was just absolutely beautiful and this weekend its cold and rainy so so were pretty limited and i guess maybe that might be the one reason that we would be forced into going   umhum right   uh south for part of the winter   umhum   uh our children live here and our home will always be here but   right i know what you mean   for better weather we might consider that next winter im not   well you know its interesting what theyve been what they have what has really caught on here is mall walking   yeah oh yes yes yes yes   now that has been something i think is really neat the mall actually opens an hour and a half earlier than the stores   umhum umhum umhum   and it so that people can come in in the winter time and walk   and its so interesting because we made an extended drive as far west as San Diego which i guess is as far west as you can go and down into Texas and then through Colorado on the way home   yes   and we went to the malls to walk a lot and thats a brotherhood out there those people are you know gosh if Sophie wasnt here today lets go find her and theyre really they know whos supposed to be there and what time theyre supposed to come and when theyre through walking they stopped for coffee and its its really neat its   that is neat you know i like that   yeah its really neat i and i even as an outsider passing through town you know after three laps around the exterior of this mall they pretty well know you so  its its a fun thing to do   umhum thats right yes yes i think so   well i i must get back to work nice chatting with you   okay it was nice chatting with you byebye   byebye
