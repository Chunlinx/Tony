                                 Erecting a Defense            The New York Timesleads with a report sourced to senior White House advisors that PresidentClinton has discussed but not finally committed to a strategy ofacknowledging to the grand jury on Monday that hed had intimate sexualencounters with Monica Lewinsky USA Today leads with a new poll taken by the papertogether with CNN indicating that Americans want Clinton to tell the truth tothe grand jury even if it means making just such an admission The Washington Post lead is that the Clinton administration hasfor months been secretly dissuading United Nations weapons teams from makingsurprise inspections in Iraq in order to avoid prompting a new crisis withBaghdad            The NYT calls Clintons grand jury appearance the most politicallyand legally perilous moment of his presidency and says he has been conductingpractice sessions in which his lawyers are questioning him and designinganswers that allow him to acknowledge a relationship with Lewinsky without going intographic detail Both the Times and the Wall Street Journal Washington Wire say that someadvisors are suggesting Clinton afterwards make a public statement about histestimony            According to the Times  the theory under which Clinton may now admitto sexual contact with Lewinsky is this when he said in his Jones casedeposition that he had never had sexual relations with Lewinsky he wasfollowing the definition of sexual relations approved by the Jones trialjudgecontact with any of a list of body parts the paper quotes one Clintonadvisors assessment of the definition cockamamiebut since the list ofbody parts doesnt include the mouth it doesnt count oral sex as sexualrelations According to the NYT  the Clinton inner circle realizes themajor political drawback of this line reinforcing the notion of Clinton inthe NYT s choice phrase as a lawyerly manipulator of language use toevade responsibilitytechnically truthful but not fundamentally honestAnother bad reaction will come from womens groups if they ever notice thataccording to the judges definition Clinton is saying that he didnt have sexwith Monica but she had sex with him            As the NYT notes today the Clinton administrations public positionadvocating unconditional access inside Iraq for UN weapons inspectors hasbeen palpably softeningto the point where in the words of the Timeslead editorial its as if the White House no longer cared about Iraqschemical biological and nuclear status But the Post lead is a bombshell because it shows innerdetails of the cavein including an August th phone call between MadeleineAlbright and the UNs top inspector Richard Butler in which Albright urgedButler to call off nonotice inspections at two sites thought to have forbiddenweapons components and supporting documents After a second such caution fromWashington last Friday says the Post  Butler canceled the inspectionsand ordered his people out of Baghdad            The WP continues to report the story it broke yesterday thatinvestigators are looking for a missing assistant on a water truck thought tohave been the bomb vehicle in the DaresSalaam embassy bombing The paper evenidentifies the man by name As does the NYT  but the Times goeson to say that according to two American security officials the water truckwas being discounted as the bomb carrierprimarily because the truck was notobliterated in the blast The paper says the security officials stronglysuggest the missing assistant is not a suspect            The WSJ runs a frontpage feature on the continuing Russian economic crisis and the story also getsplay on the NYT and USAT s Money section fronts Russiasplight says the Journal  has become the Clinton administrations maineconomic worry Washingtons main concern says the Journal  is thatthese fears will be picked up by investors in Brazil Argentina and SouthAfrica precipitating further national crises that the IMF doesnt have themoney to assuage And of course theres the underlying concern about Russiaspolitical stability            The WSJ reports that the head of the NAACP is urging the JusticeDept to look into whether banks are violating the Fair Housing Act in theiracceptance of mortgage applications The paper cites new data showing that the rejection rate for blacks is  percent compared with  percent forwhites But the Journal should have noted that these arent the relevantfigures because they arent liabilityandasset adjustedwhat we need to knoware the relative rejection rates for blacks and white of the same degree ofloanworthiness            Back to that Post lead for a moment it features something TodaysPapers applauds and would like to see more of a clear explanation of themotivations of the storys unidentified sources officials who regarded theabandoned leads as the most promising in years and objected to what theydescribed as the American role in squelching them The NYT generallymakes more of an effort in this direction than the WP  which usuallyopts for leaving it at sources
