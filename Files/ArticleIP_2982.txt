                                 Keystone Nazis            The first question that hasto be asked about the German resistance is Did it exist A good case can bemade that it did not To frame the question less contentiously Did thescattered theologians bureaucrats army officers and in one case ordinaryhousewives who defied Hitler act more as isolated individuals than as aconcerted movement On the large stage of history do these brave individualsshrink to statistical insignificance And is the socalled resistance movementtherefore a kind of optical illusion generated by a need to find some shred ofgoodness or worth in Germany under the Nazis It has to be said that booksabout the resistance seem to greatly outnumber the resisters themselves Thestack before me now includes Theodore S Hamerows On the Road to the WolfsLair German Resistance to Hitler  Joachim Fests PlottingHitlers Death  Nathan Stoltzfus Resistance of the HeartIntermarriage and the Rosenstrasse Protest in Nazi Germany  andPeter Hoffmanns Stauffenberg A Family History              Certainly these books are not mythographies They are sober sometimesskeptical historical accounts Fest surveys resistance to Hitler from  to paying particular attention to the military plot whose deficiencies hechronicles mercilessly Hamerow examines the motives of the resisters bothcivilian and military he shows them weaving sinuously between selfinterestand idealism Stoltzfus writing of the  Berlin women who marched downRosenstrasse in  to protest the incarceration of their Jewish husbandssees that his case is something less than a study in pure virtue Germans carednothing for Jews unless selfinterest intervened And yetwith oneexceptionI came away feeling these authors had exaggerated the significanceof their subject The exception is Hoffmanns book on Claus von Stauffenbergwho nearly killed Hitler with a bomb on July   Stauffenberg was a verystrange man who has to be considered as a phenomenon unto himself and will benext week in Slate            Fest the author of perhaps the best Hitler biographybegins his book with a chapter titled The Resistance That Never Was whichcovers the  period His stagesetting narrative is a conventional oneHitler cements his hold on Germany through a combination of rhetoric politicalstratagems and force Fest states that the army was the only organization ableto keep its structure intact and therefore the only one in a position to mounta concerted resistance He omits however certain successfulandunmilitaryprotests in those years against Hitlers policies The nation moreor less collectively decried Hitlers plan to kill off the mentally andphysically disabled There were also protests against domestic austeritiesduring the armaments buildup of  As the historian Ian Kershaw hasdemonstrated this kind of pinpoint smallerscale resistance was common inNazi Germany No general resistance emerged because very few Germans weregenerally unhappy with Hitlers regime            As Festdescribes it the militarys first plot against Hitler came in the tense weeksbefore the conclusion of the  Munich agreement Hitler seemed determined tolead Germany into a war for which military leaders felt neither ready noreager Had he marched toward Prague at that time they would have arrestedhimor assassinated him outright The broader circle ofconspiratorscentering on Gen Ludwig Beck who had resigned as army chief ofstaff in protest of Hitlers war plansagreed to the idea of seizing andimprisoning Hitler It was even proposed that he be declared insane by a panelof psychiatrists An inner circle believed that Hitler should be summarilyshot This interesting debate became moot once Hitler abruptly changed his mindand accepted Chamberlains peace offer at Munich The conspiracy fell apartbecause it depended too much on Hitlers own plans            After a long period ofdisillusionmentuncomfortably mixed with exhilaration at the success of theblitzkriegand as soon as Hitler decreed the invasion of the Soviet Union theofficers began to plot again In March of  Henning von Tresckow concealeda bomb in two bottles of Cointreau and had them carried onto Hitlers planeThe bottles mysteriously failed to explode Later that month one of Tresckowsassociates had a bomb wired to his body and followed Hitler through anexhibition of military trophies Hitler mysteriously exited through a sidedoor Another attempt fell through when a scheduled presentation of militaryuniforms never took place In March of  Eberhard von Breitenbuch announcedthat he would shoot Hitler in the mouth at a briefing He was pulled away fromthe Fhrer at the last minute because of a change in agenda The lastand most nearly effective of the plots was Stauffenbergs which hinged notonly on the bomb he brought into Hitlers Wolfs Lair headquarters in EastPrussia but also on coordinated strikes against the Nazi power structure inBerlin and all across Europe            Themilitary conspirators tended to defeat themselves at every turn To begin withthere was a high ratio of memorandumwriting to action Much thought was givento a new constitution Germanys proper postwar borders and other untimelymeditations Reading Fests book I was often reminded of the scene inMonty Pythons Life of Brian in which antiRoman conspirators of thePeoples Front of Judaea respond to a new crisis by shouting out Right Thiscalls for immediate discussion As Fest notes the plans were alwayscontingent they were also needlessly intricate One bomb plot fell apart whena newfangled detonating mechanism proved too complicated for anyone in the highcommand to understand            Should the plotters receive credit for their intentionsrather than their actions Hamerow takes up this question He asks whether theresisters were driven by genuine dislike of Hitler and his ideas or whetherthey decided that Hitler was superfluous only after his string of victoriesturned into a string of defeats Hamerow comes up with a mass of contradictoryevidence Some conspirators certainly were coldblooded pragmatists otherswere disaffected frontline officers who had suffered on the Eastern frontMore than a few were Christian and monarchist conservatives who deploredHitlers tendency toward selfdeification Almost all were devoted to thetraditions of the German military and infuriated by Hitlers peremptorydirectives from on high            Sometimesthere was also a moral strain to their deliberations Several of these menseemed to sense the full dimensions of the Holocaust Axel von dem Busschereeled in shock from a mass execution of Jews in the Ukraine Peter Yorck vonWartenburg stated at his treason trial in  that the escalation ofantiSemitism into genocide was the single cause of his inner break withNazism a claim that gained him nothing before a Nazi court and Tresckowunderstood the genocidal implications of the orders accompanying plans for theRussian invasion Hamerow quotes a moving statement by Tresckow If God oncepromised Abraham that he would destroy Sodom if only  righteous men livedthere then I hope that because of us God will also not destroy GermanyDeparting dramatically from the cautious analysis that guides the main body ofhis book Hamerow names Yorck and Tresckow in just such a circle of therighteous for whose sake God would spare Germany            Hamerow is in dubious pursuit of a selectcircle of absolutely good Germans and his emphasis on intentions overoutcomes leads to strange choices His pantheon also includes Helmut vonMoltke one of the leaders of the Kreisau Circle a religiousphilosophicalgroup that spent most of its time imagining an ideal future German society ButMoltke was firmly opposed to the use of force when he was put on trial withthe other conspirators after the  plot he was impressedalmostheartenedthat the judge gave him a death sentence simply for thinking aboutGermany without Hitler It testified he thought to the power of the mindMeanwhile Hamerow demotes Stauffenberg on the grounds that his brotherBerthold failed to dissociate himself completely from antiSemitic thinking athis trial To consider Moltke more righteous than Stauffenbergthe one whoactually did somethingborders on the perverse            Historysometimes tells simple stories The fact that none of the various attemptsplans and general conspiratorial notions to assassinate Hitler succeededandthat all but Stauffenbergs never seemed plausiblespeaks for itself Hitlerwas an easy target he liked to show himself in public and did not alwaystravel in conditions of airtight security The resistance literature oftencomments on Hitlers amazing luck or his uncanny ability to sense dangerbut the failures of the resistance might be better ascribed to the calculatedunluck of the resisters their own ability to sense danger and step away fromit and their overall minuscule number Hitlers death by his own hand cannotbe counted as one of historys accidents Germany could not imagine any otherdeath for him                           Nextweek  The mysterious motives of Hitlers wouldbe assassin
