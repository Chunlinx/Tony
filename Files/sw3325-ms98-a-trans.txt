        okay well do you have a pet     i have two cats   two cats youre lucky   and do and oh and two fish   you have two fish   and what do you have   well uh my husband you know how sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing   oh no   my husband is a hunter fisherman outdoorsman Marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog so we have a black Labrador   um   beautiful gorgeous black Labrador but to me he belongs up in the field you know in the ranch in the farm and   right does he sleep in your house   well  because we finally negotiated that i was losing my mind um he sleeps in the laundry room and then he goes out for the day but this this is a beautiful dog and he is wonderful with our little girls and he is hes comes from a purebred line and theres nothing you could say bad about him except that i was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle   right right   and this is huge you know of course when he runs around the yard he just digs he doesnt know that hes tearing up things but he does   yeah yep   and the worst part that i had with him hes hes three now was when he was uh about eight months old and i did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one   uhhuh   and i left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while i was gone for about an hour and i came home and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall   oh my word   and it was in the floor and i just about lost it and i called and said come home and get your dog and so he said well puppies just chew when theyre nervous and well i wish you had told me you know and it was about eight months later he ate a piece of a linoleum he kept picking at it and i didnt know the the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it   oh dear   so the last thing he did was when i had set out a whole lot of begonias in the back yard and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch       and i told my husband i said you know its either me or the dog and he looked at me like well you know so he loves this dog and every night when he comes home from work he hugs it and talks to him and hes a good dog   good bye umhum   so its one of those things im just having to get used to and thats why i laughed when they called it the topic i thought oh boy do i have a pet   oh     but i i grew up with cats and im very comfortable yeah   i love my cats i had one cat for eighteen years i got her when i lived in Hawaii   oh   before i even got married i had my cat   shes old isnt she oh i started to say then you broke your heart   well she i had to have her put to sleep last June oh it was awful it was just awful but and she just sat there on my lap you know she just just waited and   oh oh bless your heart that makes me feel so bad   oh it was awful but her hair but the bad thing was though she would pee in my husbands shoes you know and she just liked his shoes and hed have to dress hundred dollar shoes   yeah oh no   oh oh no   oh its just bad and my closet and it was oh so sick     oh thats awful ive never heard of that before   it oh its just terrible and once she did it you know then she would i mean she wouldnt if our shoes sat side by side she would pee in my husbands shoes she must have known he didnt like her or something   umhum or the smell or something   oh anyway ive ive and i would shut i would bar the closet doors and i would carpet carpet vacuum         uh clean the carpets and oh dear it was just awful that was very funny   uhhuh well does now does your cat sleep

things and im not a dog person   they do wreck things well im not either  im not either and its just been   ooh i wouldnt want a lab it sounds beautiful but but   hes beautiful but its just one of those concessions i just had to make but i kind of ignore him now todays the first cold weve had in Texas and its really cold and drizzly and its freezing and people are doing their fires     um   and
