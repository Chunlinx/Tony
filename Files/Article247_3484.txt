                                 Trying To Read the Feds Mixed Messages                        In William Greiders long book on the Federal Reserve Secrets of theTemple a fascinating book but in retrospect a remarkably illconsideredindictment of inflationfighting theres not much mention of the conversionof the Federal Reserve into a bully pulpit But as todays quarterpoint hikein the discount ratein addition to the expected quarterpoint hike in thefederal funds ratedemonstrates the Fed has at some point in the last fiveyears or so come to see inflationfighting as not merely a matter of raisingor lowering rates Its also a matter of sending the right messages to the bondand to a lesser extent the stock markets            Ive touched on this point once before when the Fed announced at its lastmeeting that it was keeping interest rates steady but changing its bias Whereonce the Fed kept its deliberations secret and acted as sphinxlike as possibleabout its intentions it now tries to indicate what its concerned about andthe direction in which its leaning In one sense this has made the exerciseof trying to game the Fed easier since theres more material to go on Inanother sense its made everything trickier since there are a host of signalsto interpret and sometimes theyre not in harmony            Today for instance the Fed didnt make what would have been the surprisingmove namely hiking interest rates by  basis points instead of  One basispoint is equal to onehundredth of a point Had it pushed through the largerhike the selloff in the stock market would probably have been frightening atleast at first But the increase would certainly have slammed the brakes on aneconomy thats still running very hot            You might assume that the quarterpoint hike means the Fed isnt thatworried about inflation even though there are signs that continued strongdemand and tight labor markets are beginning to make themselves felt But thentheres the discountrate hike to consider This is the first time since thespring of  that the Fed has increased the discount rate which is theinterest rate the Fed charges banks who want to borrow money from it Andwhile the discount rate itself is not that important which is to say that anincrease in it will have no material effect on the economy the message theincrease sends is important and that message is that the Fed is more concernedabout inflation than the small hike in the federal funds rate would indicate Ithink            In addition to the rate increases the Fed also shifted its bias back towardneutral which suggests that the economy is still growing faster than Greenspanbelieved it would be But the fact that the Fed isnt biased toward furthertightening suggests that the economy isnt necessarily growing faster thanGreenspan would like it to be            Got all that Good because Im not sure that I do            In the long run worrying about all this stuff probably doesnt matter verymuch The Fed and the bond market will determine how fast the economy goes bydetermining interest rates and the concrete impact of the federal funds rateand of the Feds printing or notprinting money will far outweigh anypsychological effect of the Feds symbolic gestures But it also seems truethat Greenspan has come to recognize the beneficial effect of using thosegestures to push interest rates in a certain direction without the Feds havingto take concrete action Its as if he can speed things up or slow them downwithout doing much of anything real            Of course mixed messages are a persistent danger here as evidenced bytodays herkyjerky market where bond prices rose sharply while the Dowmeandered and the Nasdaq actually went up But the truth is that in the end themarket will do a good job of sorting through the messages and finding the onesthat matter Its trying to interpret the messages on your ownlike I justtried to dothats a recipe for utter confusion
