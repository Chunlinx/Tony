                                 Who Shall Inherit the Earth            Surely youve known coupleslike this They have two children and are undecided about having a third Theylean one way and then the other they weigh the pros and cons and finallythey decide to go ahead Then from the instant that third child is born theparents love it so deeply that theyd gladly sacrifice all their assets topreserve its life            Comparethat with the way people shop for appliances or furniture or compact discsGenerally speaking if you know youre going to treasure something you donthesitate to buy it By contrast the CDs you waver over though sometimessurprisingly good are often unsurprisingly forgettableand on averageunlikely to be cherished Why then are children so different            One of my colleagues maintains that theres no realinconsistency here He says its wrong to think of a baby as the equivalent ofa microwave oven instead you should think of it as the equivalent of anaddictive drug People hesitate about whether to try heroin but once they tryit they become addicted and cant give it up Likewise with babies            But thatI think is a very bad analogy because heroin addicts tend to be people whobelieved at the outset that they could escape addiction Perhaps thats becausetheyre foolish or perhaps its because theyre highstakes gamblers but thatis what they were thinking Why else would we hear so many addicts recountingtheir experiences with the phrase if only I had known  Thats not trueof parents Parents know in advance and with near certainty that they will beaddicted to their children They choose their addiction with eyes wide openjust like a customer choosing a microwave oven            Moreoverand here is the key differencebetween parents and heroin addictsparents know in advance with nearcertainty that they wont want to break their addiction If youve already gottwo kids and are wavering over a third then youve already got a pretty goodidea of what parenthood is like and you already know that unlike the addictwho despises his addiction youre going to treasure your attachment to yourchildren When you know youre going to love something that much after youvegot it how can you hesitate about getting it in the first place            But asthe parent of an only child I can verify that people do behave that way Iknow that my unconceived children would be my most valuable possessions if Ibrought them to fruition yet Ive chosen to leave them unconceived            Iam inclined to conclude that nobodyincluding mehas acoherent way of thinking about how to make decisions that appropriately reflectemotional and moral attachments to people who are not yet born The resultingconfusion makes it almost impossible to resolve important questions of publicpolicy            Forexample the following question seems to me to be of both supreme importanceand supreme difficulty Do living people have any moral obligation to thetrillions of potential people who will never have the opportunity to liveunless we conceive them            The answer is surely either yes or no buteither answer leads to troubling conclusions If the answer is yes then itseems to follow that we are morally obliged to have more children than wereally want The unconceived are like prisoners being held in a sort of limbounable to break through into the world of the living If they have rights thensurely we are required to help some of them escape            In anearlier Slate column Be Fruitful and Multiply I argued that we should reproduce morequickly because it would improve living standards for existing people Here Iam raising the entirely separate question of whether we should reproduce morequickly in order to give life to potential people            But if the answer is noif we have no obligations tothose imprisoned soulsthen it seems there can be no moral objection to ourtrashing Earth to the point where there will be no future generations Thatsnot to say that wed necessarily want to trash Earth we might have selfishreasons for preserving it I mean to say only that if we ever did want to trashEarth it would be morally permissible If we prevent future generations frombeing conceived in the first place and if the unconceived dont count as moralentities then our crimes have no victims so theyre not true crimes            So if the unconceived haverights we should massively subsidize population growth and if they dont haverights we should feel free to destroy Earth Either conclusion is disturbingbut whats most disturbing of all is that if we reject one it seems we areforced to accept the other Perhaps theres a third way and thats just toadmit that were incapable of being logically rigorous about issues involvingthe unconceived            Ted Baxter the anchorman onThe Mary Tyler Moore                Show  planned to have six children in thehopes that one of them would grow up to be a creative genius who could solvethe population problem Right now Id settle for a creative genius who couldteach us how to think about the population problem I hope the next generationis large enough to include that person
