                                 Whats the Legal Status of Gay Marriage                        The Vermont Supreme Court ruled this week that gay couples are entitled tothe same benefits and protections as heterosexual married couples Earlierthis month Hawaiis high court determined that the state was not required togrant marriage licenses to gays and lesbians Why the different results Andwhat legal effect will the Vermont decision have on the rest of the nation            Like virtually all states Vermont and Hawaii have equal protectionclauses in their constitutions that guarantee all citizens the same treatmentunder the law These clauses are similar to the equal protection provision ofthe US Constitutions th Amendment which was used to secure civil rightsfor racial minorities women and other groups In both states gay couplessued asserting that the ban on samesex marriage deprived them of equalprotection They argued that it blocked their access to the same rights andobligations that heterosexual couples are granted through marriage includinghealth and pension benefits inheritance rights joint decisionmaking powerand shared parental and financial responsibilities            In  the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that indeed denial of samesexmarriage amounted to discrimination on the basis of sex and sexual orientationUnless the state could demonstrate to lower courts that it had a valid interestin denying gay marriages continued discrimination would be unconstitutional Astate judge ruled in  that the state had failed to meet this requirementwhich seemed to pave the way for gay marriage The state appealed but beforethe case reached the Supreme Court again Hawaii voters passed a constitutionalamendment exempting marriage from the equal protection clause Hawaiis SupremeCourt had no choice but to throw out the gay couples claims to marriagelicenses            With reasoning similar to that of the Hawaii courts the Vermont SupremeCourt determined that the legislature was constitutionally required to extendto samesex couples the common benefits and protections that flow from marriageunder Vermont law Vermonters have not passed an amendment like Hawaiisexempting marriage from the equal protection clause although they could TheVermont Supreme Court left it to the legislature to decide whether to extendthese rights to gay couples through staterecognized marriage or a new categoryof domestic partnership            If Vermont recognizes gay marriages the national ramifications will beimmediate because all the states recognize marriages performed in other statesGay couples would travel to Vermont to get married and then upon returninghome demand that their states recognize the unions             Anticipating this strategy Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act in declaring that states would not be compelled to recognize samesex unionsperformed elsewhere Since Hawaiis  decision  states have passedpreemptive laws saying they would not accept gay marriages from otherstates            The courts will have to decide whether these laws are constitutional TheUS Constitution requires each state to give full faith and credit  to thepublic Acts Records and judicial Proceedings of every other state TheSupreme Court has held that this full faith and credit provision coversdivorceotherwise you might have to get redivorced from your former spouseif you moved to a new state  If the Supreme Court extends the provision tocover marriage the federal Defense of Marriage Actas well as the state lawsbarring samesex unionswould quite likely be deemed unconstitutional If notthe issue would be left to each state to decide            If Vermont declines to recognize gay marriage it will have to define a newcategory of domestic partnership that provides precisely the same stateprotections and benefits as marriage But this domestic partnership would notnecessarily yield rights for gay couples from other states or from the federalgovernment Many federal benefits and responsibilities depend on the marriageclassification which has a privileged constitutional status that domesticpartnership does not Marriage is considered so fundamental a right in factthat it cannot be withdrawn from any citizenseven prisoners            Although the wording of constitutional equal protection clauses varies fromstate to state and Vermonts interpretation is not a binding precedent judgesoften look to courts in other states for guidance on how to rule in similarcircumstances And the Vermont ruling provides a basis for the argument thatthe US Constitutions equal protection clause should be interpreted toguarantee marriage rights for gays nationally So regardless of the Vermontlegislatures course of action gay rights advocates will use the ruling inother court battles                           Explainer thanks many Slate readers for suggesting thistopic                        Next question
