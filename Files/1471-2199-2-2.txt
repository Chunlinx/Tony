                    Introduction        Cancer evolves from the accumulation of mutations and        the deregulation of two classes of genes oncogenes and        tumor suppressor genes The large majority of breast        cancers arise in epithelia of the breast and they are        thought to evolve from hyperplasia with atypia to carcinoma        in situ invasive carcinoma and finally metastatic        disease The molecular mechanisms leading to breast        malignancies are unclear but many genetic abnormalities        and epigenetic factors have been implicated including        changes affecting known tumor suppressor genes          p          BRCA BRCA          PTENMMACTEP and protooncogenes         neuErbBHER          ErbBEGFR          PRADcyclin D          Mdm  and         cmyc reviewed in ref         The gene product of         PTEN          phosphatase and         tensin homolog deleted from        chromosome  is a lipid phosphatase that reverses the        activities of phosphatidylinositol kinase PIK by        dephosphorylating the D position of its lipid products        phosphatidylinositol  bisphosphate PtdInsP        phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate PtdInsP and        triphosphate PtdInsP    the elevated        levels of which are linked to the transforming ability of        PIK reviewed in ref         PtdInsP and PtdInsP recruit AKT also        known as protein kinase B PKB to the membrane through        the Nterminal pleckstrin homology PH domain of AKT        reviewed in ref  Membrane localization renders AKT        permissive to phosphorylation by phosphatidyl        inositoldependent kinases PDK and PDK at Thr within        the activation loop and at Ser near the carboxyl        terminus Phosphorylation activates the kinase domain of        AKT which in turn phosphorylates target proteins on        serine and threonine residues Substrates of AKT include        glycogen synthase kinase  GSK pS kinase BAD        Caspase  EBP IB kinase  and members of the Forkhead        transcription family reviewed in ref   Constitutive        membrane localization of AKT leads to its deregulated        activation and can induce oncogenic transformation                  All three human members of the AKT family are        overproduced in various human cancers         AKT is overexpressed in gastric        adenocarcinomas and breast cancer cell lines         AKT is amplified and overexpressed        in pancreatic ovarian and breast cancers and         AKT is upregulated in estrogen        receptordeficient breast cancer and in        androgenindependent prostate cell lines reviewed in ref                Consistent with the role of PTEN as a lipid phosphatase                PTEN deficient human and mouse cells        have elevated levels of intracellular PtdInsP           and demonstrate constitutive activation of AKT in the        absence of growth factors     The relationship        between components of this pathway is also conserved in        flies and worms        A germline mutation in         PTEN is associated with        multineoplastic autosomally dominant syndromes in humans        such as Cowden disease and BannayanZonana syndrome also        known as BannayanRileyRuvalcaba syndrome and  of        affected females in these families develop breast cancer            The         PTEN gene is also frequently deleted        or mutated in a variety of sporadic human malignancies        such as glioblastoma and carcinomas of the prostate        endometrium and breast Although somatic mutations in the        gene have been detected in only about  of breast cancers        loss of heterozygosity LOH at the         PTEN locus q is frequently        found approximately  and  of breast tumors have no        detectable or reduced levels of the protein product                     Three independent mouse lines carrying inactivating         Pten mutations have been made            All mice homozygous for these         Pten mutations die during early        embryogenesis By  months of age heterozygous mice        develop tumors of the lymphoid system colon uterus and        adrenal medulla with very high penetrance and tumors of        the prostate and thyroid with lower penetrance While        benign mammary lesions usually fibroadenomas are found in        female mice after  months of age few animals develop        ductal carcinomas KP and RP unpublished  which        account for over  of human breast cancers        In an effort to develop a model for studying the effects        of         Pten inactivation in mammary        oncogenesis we have introduced an additional genetic        alteration an MMTV         Wnt transgene by breeding         Pten heterozygotes   with MMTV         Wnt transgenic TG mice          Female mice harboring the         Wnt transgene develop extensive        mammary hyperplasia early in life and  of them develop        mammary ductal carcinomas by  months of age   This        transgene has been shown to collaborate with         Fgf and inactivation of         p to accelerate the appearance of        mammary tumors    After a mutant allele of         Pten was crossed into         Wnt TG mice we found that ductal        carcinomas appeared earlier than either alteration alone        and that LOH at the         Pten locus occurred in the majority        of these tumors suggesting a selective growth advantage in        cells that lack         Pten functions                    Results                Wnt TG mice have been used to        assess the functions of a number of genetic lesions in        breast carcinogenesis because tumors appear with        predictable kinetics The median age at which tumors are        detected is  months in MMTV         Wnt TG females             After one mutated allele of         Pten was bred into this transgenic        line tumors appeared significantly earlier than in sibling        females harboring only a MMTV         Wnt transgene P   Fig        A Fifty percent of         Pten          Wnt TG female mice formed tumors by         months  months earlier than         Wnt TG mice Fig A While it        took one year for the entire cohort  of         Wnt TG females with a wild type         Pten background to develop tumors        all         Wnt TG         Pten  females showed tumors by         months of age Five each of         Pten  mice without a         Wnt transgene were monitored for         months and  months but none developed any palpable        mammary lesions These observations differ from a recent        report that one of the other two         Pten  lines develops fibroadenomas        and adenocarcinomas in the mammary tissue after  months of        age   The lack of a mammary phenotype in our studies        could be due to differences in the targeting constructs        the genetic backgrounds or even environmental agents        By one year of age approximately  of         Wnt TG males have been reported to        develop mammary tumors     In our cross one of        the four tumors from         Wnt TG males in an otherwise wild        type background was a mammary carcinoma the other three        tumors were salivary in origin with a similar        histopathology to the mammary lesion The appearance of        tumors was greatly accelerated in the         Pten heterozygous background Fig        B Fifty percent of males developed tumors by  months        of age and all developed tumors within  months As in        the case of         Wnt TG male mice without         Pten mutations the majority of        tumors  arose in the salivary tissue only a small        number of tumors  were mammary in origin and        interestingly some  were bilateral or unilateral        muzzle tumors of epithelial origin similar        histopathologically to lesions found in mammary and        salivary tissues        To determine if the wild type allele of         Pten was inactivated in tumors        arising in a         Pten  background  tumors from         Wnt TG         Pten  mice were examined for LOH        by Southern hybridization Seven tumors had lost the wild        type         Pten allele see Fig for an example        of the analysis This result suggests that in        tumorigenesis cells that lack a functional allele of         Pten have a significant proliferative        advantage over the cells that retain the normal copy of         Pten         Histological examination showed that tumors from         Wnt TG mice regardless of         Pten status were adenocarcinomas        with cribriform cystic and focal papillary growth        patterns However  of the  tumors that were         Wnt TG         Pten  with LOH appeared to have a        higher nuclear grade more cellular stroma and a more        infiltrative pattern compared to the tumors without a         Pten defect Fig  suggesting a        more aggressive phenotype        In human cancer a tumor suppressor gene can be        inactivated by mutations chromosomal loss promoter        silencing and other means To determine if the Pten        protein was produced in         Wnt TG         Pten  tumors that did not undergo        LOH sections were analyzed using an immunohistochemical        assay with a polyclonal rabbit antibody Abundant amounts        of Pten were detected in mammary ducts from wild type mice        Pten was detected at reduced levels in both hyperplastic        ducts and mammary tumors that did not have LOH at the         Pten allele Fig  suggesting that        Pten was indeed made from the second allele Similar low        levels of Pten were also detected in mammary ductal        epithelial cells in         Pten heterozygous mice that did not        have a         Wnt transgene suggesting that the         Wnt transgene does not influence         Pten expression As expected Pten        was not detected in tumors that had undergone LOH at the         Pten locus Fig E        Inactivation of         Pten promotes membrane recruitment of        AKT and its subsequent activation by phosphorylation at        Ser and Thr     All three human isoforms        of AKT have been found to be deregulated in human breast        cancer cells     To determine if activated AKT        was increased in tumors that had a         Pten defect these sections were        stained using an antibody that specifically detects AKT        phosphorylated at Ser  and AKT and AKT phosphorylated        at equivalent sites Tumors that were         Wnt TG         Pten  with LOH displayed staining        of phosphorylated AKT Fig A Surprisingly the staining        was patchy suggesting additional factors may be required        for AKT activation As expected phosphorylated AKT was        undetectable in hyperplastic ducts in tumors from         Wnt TG         Pten  mice and tumors from         Wnt TG         Pten  mice that retained the wild        type allele Fig B  C        Several apoptotic pathways may be inhibited upon        activation of AKT promoting maintenance and survival of        tumor cells Cellular proliferation may also be enhanced by        activated AKT which inhibits p and GSK leading to        stabilization of cyclin D   However tumors from         Wnt TG         Pten  mice have low apoptotic        rates    per digital camera field using a x        objective and high proliferation rates    Neither        apoptotic nor proliferation rates were affected by the        status of         Pten when measured by the TUNEL        terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferasemediated UTP end        labeling assay which labels the ends of fragmented DNA        present in apoptotic cells and immunohistochemical        staining for Ki a cell proliferation marker data not        shown        Most         Wnt TG mice  developed only        one palpable tumor regardless of         Pten status Fiftythree of  single        sections from         Pten  glands that were free of a        palpable mass did not show any lesions more advanced than        ductal hyperplasia However at the time of sacrifice the        majority  of glands from         Wnt TG          Pten mice had intraductal        squamous lesions of various sizes Fig D These squamous        lesions were usually multifocal and located both at the        periphery of the adenocarcinomas and in other mammary        glands free of adenocarcinomas        Since         Pten mutations are usually found in        advanced tumors and the protein has been suggested to        inhibit cell spreading migration and invasion           it is possible that the tumors from         Wnt TG         Pten  mice may have a higher        potential to metastasize than those from mice carrying a         Wnt transgene in a wild type         Pten background         Wnt TG mice occasionally show        lymphoid or pulmonary metastasis   and serial        sectioning of lung tissues from the animals reported here        revealed microsocopic metastatic foci in two of five lungs        from         Wnt TG mice bearing primary tumors         cm in size However         Wnt TG mice and the         Wnt TG         Pten  mice harbored metastatic        foci at similar frequencies  Statistical evaluation        was not performed because the sample sizes were too        small                    Discussion        Mouse models are valuable research tools for the study        of the molecular mechanisms of oncogenesis and for the        testing and screening of cancer therapeutic agents targeted        to specific oncogenic lesions In order to produce such a        model for studying the effects of         Pten mutations in breast cancer we        have crossed         Wnt TG mice to mice heterozygous        for         Pten  Mice transgenic for MMTV         Wnt and heterozygous for         Pten developed mammary        adenocarcinomas much earlier than mice carrying either        lesion alone The majority of tumors in         Wnt TG         Pten  mice had lost the wild type        allele of         Pten  suggesting that the complete        inactivation of         Pten function provides an additional        growth advantage to these tumors LOH at the         Pten locus has recently been reported        in mammary tumors arising in         Pten heterozygous mice   but        only  of the mice developed tumors before the age of         weeks and in our cross none of the         Pten  mice without the         Wnt transgene had a palpable        mammary tumor before the age of  weeks LOH at the         Pten locus has also been reported in        adrenal and lymphatic tumors but not in uterine tumors and        prostate lesions in         Pten  mice KP  RP        submitted         Activated AKT was more abundant in tumors that were         Wnt TG         Pten  with LOH as has been shown        for uterine tumors in         Pten heterozygous mice KP RP        submitted The presence of areas unstained with antibody        specific for phosphorylated AKT suggests that additional        factors other than Pten may influence the activation of        AKT        Neither apoptosis nor proliferation as determined by        the TUNEL assay and KI staining was significantly        different between tumors heterozygous for         Pten with or without LOH and those        without a         Pten defect This result may seem        paradoxical since increased phosphorylated AKT due to        inactivation of         Pten  suppresses apoptosis and        promotes proliferation However tumors in         Wnt TG mice in a wild type         Pten background already have highly        suppressed apoptosis and accelerated proliferation rates        and any incremental changes if present may be difficult        to detect with our current assays Nonetheless a seemingly        minor difference in either apoptosis or proliferation could        have a dramatic impact on tumor growth over time        Accelerated appearance of mammary adenocarcinomas in the        presence of a         Pten mutation suggests a synergy        between         Pten inactivation and the         Wnt transgene The apparent        cooperation of these two genetic factors is further        strengthened by our finding that the majority of tumors        arising in a         Pten  background have lost the        wild type allele To date heterozygous inactivation of any        of the other tumor suppressor genes implicated in breast        cancer including         P Brca Brca  and         Rb  has failed to cooperate with         Wnt in promoting the appearance of        mammary tumors reviewed in ref  Therefore it is        possible that the signal pathway controlled by         Pten is one of the preferred partners        of the         Wnt pathway in cancer progression        although it remains possible that LOH at the         Pten locus is more likely to occur        than for the other alleles crossed into         Wnt  TG mice Even though         Wnt has not been directly        implicated in human cancers many components of the Wnt        signaling pathway such as catenin APC         cmyc and         cyclin D  are involved in human        tumors including breast cancer reviewed in ref         One of the goals of mouse modeling efforts is to provide        an opportunity for preclinical testing of generalized or        mechanismspecific therapeutics in a defined genetic        setting Many human breast tumors have reduced levels of        PTEN hence inhibitors of the cell signaling pathways        affected by PTEN could be tested in the model we have        developed One such candidate is the rapamycin analog        CCI which has been suggested to inhibit the AKT        signaling pathway probably through inhibition of mTOR        target of rapamycin a potential target of AKT reviewed        in ref  CCI has been shown to have inhibitory        effects on the growth of         Pten deficient tumors in the uterus        and prostate in mice KP  RP submitted M Neshat         C Sawyers submitted Since tumors arise rapidly        after a copy of         Pten is inactivated and with        predictable kinetics this model may be useful for testing        the efficacy of these therapies        Results presented here and published earlier              have clearly demonstrated the significant        impact of         Pten on mammary oncogenesis Future        testing will examine the tumorigenic effects caused by        other kinds of genetic damage in the signaling pathways        affected by Pten The TVAdirected gene delivery system        reviewed in ref  can be used to introduce viral        vectors carrying genes encoding an activated form of PIK        AKT or candidate substrates for AKT into the mammary        tissue of         Wnt TG mice This would allow the        testing of therapeutic interventions directed to specific        steps of the signaling pathway regulated by Pten                    Materials and methods                  Mice          MMTV           Wnt TG mice   and those that          carry a mutant allele of           Pten   have been described          Male           Wnt TG mice a mixture of FVB          SJL and CBL were crossed with           Pten heterozygous females a          mixture of CBL and SvJ to generate all three          genotypes used in this paper           Wnt TG           Pten            Wnt TG           Pten  and           Pten  Genotyping for the           Wnt transgene was done using PCR          as described   PCR using primers from the neo          cassette was performed to detect the           Pten knockout allele Mice were          monitored weekly for tumor formation by visual inspection          andor palpation most tumors were found when they were          approximately  cm Most of tumors were harvested for          further analysis when they were  cm in diameter          Tissues were fixed in  buffered formalin and          paraffinembedded For histological survey one HE          section per block was analyzed                          Immunohistochemical staining and TUNEL assay          Formalinfixed and paraffinembedded sections were          deparaffined and rehydrated in several changes of xylene          ethanol and water Antigenunmasking was achieved by          boiling the slides for  minutes in citrate buffer pH           or  mM EDTA Endogenous peroxidase activity was          inactivated by a  minute incubation in  hydrogen          peroxide when needed Immunohistochemical stainings were          performed using Vector ABC kits Vector Laboratories          following the manufacturers recommendations and as          described   Rabbit antibodies against Pten Ki          and AKT phosphorylated at Ser  were from Neomarkers          Dako and New England BioLabs respectively The TUNEL          assay was performed as described                            Southern hybridization          DNAs extracted from tissues and tumors were digested          with           Pst I followed by electrophoresis          and blotted to Nylon membrane Hybridization was done in          ExpressHyb
