                    Background        While the radiographic and histologic progression of        fracture healing is well understood there are less data on        the cytokines that regulate and control the healing process        at the cellular level The bone morphogenetic proteins        BMP have been found to be expressed in the fracture        callus by immunostaining of the protein     as well        as by measurement of mRNA    and         in situ hybridization    The        receptors for BMP are also upregulated during fracture        repair     Morone         et al   observed increased mRNA        expression of both matrix genes and BMP genes during the        healing of spinal fusions in rabbits There was a        sequential expression of these genes in that BMP peaked        first followed by BMP then BMP and last by a second        peak of BMP expression   The data for BMP expression        during fracture repair combined with the efficacy of the        BMPs in stimulating bone induction and fracture healing        have led to the concept that the BMPs are key molecules in        the initiation of this healing process          Derangement of the expression of BMPs and other        skeletally active cytokines may be important in        understanding the failure of healing in delayed unions It        is not clear why in some fractures the healing process        seems to come to a halt and does not progress further        without surgical intervention        We have found that younger rats heal midshaft femoral        fractures faster than do older rats   In these earlier        studies oneyearold rats failed to achieve normal        biomechanical strength within  weeks after midshaft        femoral fracture   In contrast young rats achieved        normal biomechanical strength by four weeks after fracture          In this model as the rats get older it takes        progressively longer for them to begin a periosteal        reaction after fracture and it takes longer to achieve        bridging callus This slowing of fracture healing with age        has been reported in humans   as well as in rats           In humans the time to union increased with age for        humeral fractures          The reason for the slowing of fracture healing in older        animals is not fully understood For some time it has been        known that there are changes in the periosteal cell layer        with age   Following fracture there is an increase in        the rate of mitosis in the periosteum near the fracture        site This rate slows with age Fewer cells enter mitosis        and more time is required for the cells to undergo mitosis          This may reflect a reduction in the number of        osteogenic stem cells available for skeletal repair in        older individuals          Alternatively changes in the expression of the        cytokines controlling fracture healing would also affect        the rate of healing Recent work has shown that the genes        responsible for embryonic induction of skeletal tissue are        also involved in fracture healing The BMPs are prominently        expressed during embryonic tissue induction reviewed by          BMP and BMP have been reported in the fracture        callus of rats   and mice          This led to the hypothesis that the delayed fracture        healing in older individuals may be related to        abnormalities in the BMPsignaling pathway To test this        hypothesis bone fracture was induced in young and older        rats and gene expression was measured in the fracture        callus at various times after fracture induction        Expression of osteocalcin type I collagen and type II        collagen were measured as markers of fracture callus        formation BMP BMP and the type IA BMP receptor were        measured as potential regulators of the healing process                                Materials and Methods                  Rats          Intact female SpragueDawley rats were used at  weeks          of age    g body weight at fracture or at           months of age    g at fracture They were          purchased at  or  months of age respectively and housed          with Teklad Rodent Diet W  Harlan Madison WI          and tap water           ad libitum This work was done in          an AAALAC accredited vivarium under a protocol approved          by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee                          Surgery          The animals were anesthetized with ketaminexylazine          at approximately  mg mg per kg body weight A small          skin incision was made in the knee and the patella          deflected A hole was drilled into the intercondylar          notch and a stainless steel wire  mm diameter type           V OSWGX Small Parts Inc Miami Lakes FL          was inserted into the medullary canal and recessed          slightly The muscle was sutured and the skin closed          with wound clips As described earlier   a closed          middiaphyseal fracture was induced using a Bonnarens and          Einhorn fracture induction device   The device was          preset to  mm of travel The  g weight was dropped          from a height of  cm for the young rats or  cm for          the older rats Randomly selected intact rats of the same          age were used for time controls Femoral radiographs          were made at fracture at one week after fracture and at          euthanasia          Rats were euthanized at    and  weeks after          fracture The times were chosen based on the study by          Morone           et al   and on our experience          with fracture healing in younger rats   The femora          were rapidly harvested and a portion of the femur was          collected using a Dremel tool Dremel Racine WI with          an ultra thinflex diamond disc saw Stoelting Wood          Dale IL Two cuts were made at right angles to the long          axis of the femur on either side of the visible callus on          the periosteal surface of the femur The tissue          collection included any portion of the femur whose          external surface was altered by the fracture repair          process In practice this collected bone sample was          onethird of the overall femoral length was centered on          the callus and included the callus cortical bone and          marrow elements The sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen          and stored at C until analyzed                          Gene Expression          Tissues were

Rectangles of constant area were defined and          radioactivity was recorded in units of photo stimulated          luminescence PSL          The samples were organized so that one sample from

with the MannWhitney U test          For the measurement of gene expression there were three          to four samples per time point per age except for the          older rats at  n   and  n   weeks after          fracture due to unanticipated attrition For the younger          rats at     and  weeks after fracture there were              and  rats per group respectively while for          the older rats there were     and  rats per          group respectively The experiment was designed to have          three rats per group However one older rat at  weeks          after fracture was unusable due to bone infection For          the four rats designated for study at  weeks after          fracture two were lost due to the intramedullary pin          backing out necessitating early euthanasia and one was          infected and therefore unusable                            Results                  Radiology          Radiographs were made of all rats after surgery one          week later and at the time of euthanasia There were          similar middiaphyseal fractures in both the younger and          the older rats At one week after fracture there was an          obvious periosteal reaction in the younger rats By six          weeks after fracture the younger rats had healed their          fractures with abundant mineralized callus and          remodeling was underway          In contrast there is little change in the radiographs          of the older rats at one week after fracture At six          weeks after fracture these older rats had not healed          their fractures and showed only minimal periosteal          reaction All younger rats achieved bridging callus by          six weeks after fracture whereas none of the older rats          achieved bridging callus by this time data not          shown                          Time course for gene expression          Most genes had the same pattern of low levels of          expression in unfractured bone There was an increased          mRNA level after fracture which led to a peak in          activity at one or two weeks after fracture Thereafter          mRNA expression levels fell to very low levels at four          weeks after fracture and undetectable levels at six weeks          after fracture Figs and  The  younger rats were          well healed radiographically by this time and their          decreased gene expression was understandable          However for the monthold rats reported in detail          here there was the same pattern of low level of gene          expression at four to six weeks after fracture Since          these rats had not healed radiographically the reduction          in gene expression to baseline was more difficult to          explain Additional studies were done with           oneyearold rats which confirmed this pattern Seven of          these oneyearold rats were studied at four weeks after          fracture and the other  oneyearold rats were studied          at six weeks after fracture These oneyearold rats had          the same pattern of lowtoundetectable gene expression          at four to six weeks after fracture Thus a total of           rats at  months of age have been studied at four to          six weeks after fracture and all had lowtoundetectable          gene expression for both skeletal matrix genes and for          BMPrelated genes                          Matrix genes          Three genes were measured as an index of matrix          synthesis osteocalcin and type I collagen for bone and          type II collagen for cartilage Both osteocalcin mRNA          levels Fig  top and type I collagen mRNA levels          Fig  middle tended to be higher in the unfractured          time younger rats than in the time older rats          Fracture resulted in a rise in gene expression in both          age groups to a peak at two weeks after fracture          Thereafter gene expression levels fell to low levels          lower than the time controls for each age group at four          and six weeks after fracture Fig           Type II collagen mRNA expression differed from that of          type I collagen in being undetectable in the diaphyseal          bone of the time controls in both age groups Fig           bottom This reflected a lack of cartilage synthesis in          the intact diaphysis of the femur Fracture resulted in a          rise in gene expression for both age groups to a peak at          one to two weeks after fracture Both age groups          decreased the mRNA expression of this gene at four and          six weeks after fracture to undetectable levels Fig           bottom                          BMPrelated genes          Three genes were measured to evaluate the regulatory          control process over fracture healing BMP mRNA levels          were undetectable in the time controls of both age          groups Fig  top Fracture induced the expression of          this gene Expression peaked at one to two weeks after          fracture for both age groups BMP expression for both          age groups fell to undetectable levels at four and six          weeks after fracture Fig  top          BMP mRNA levels were also undetectable in the time          controls for both age groups Fig  middle Fracture          increased gene expression to a peak at one week after          fracture in both age groups There was a tendency for the          older rats to have higher BMP levels at weeks  and           after fracture P   Gene expression levels          declined to undetectable levels at four and six weeks          after fracture Fig  middle          In contrast the type IA BMP receptor mRNA levels were          detectable in the time control younger rats but not in          the older rats Fig  bottom Fracture enhanced gene          expression severalfold in both age groups to a peak at          one week after fracture The mRNA levels at four and six          weeks after fracture were very low to undetectable in          both groups Fig  bottom                          Housekeeping genes          Gene expression data are usually normalized to the          expression of another gene whose mRNA levels are not          affected by the experimental variables being studied          This controls for and corrects for variation in          extraction reverse transcription and the polymerase          chain reaction In this project S ribosomal RNA was          found to give a signal at each time after fracture in          each sample However the S rRNA amplimer varied with          time after fracture data not shown          Other housekeeping genes that are widely used were          also studied and were found to vary in expression with          time after fracture Glyceraldehydephosphate          dehydrogenase GPDH actin and tubulin increased          in both age groups following fracture Expression then          decreased in both young and older rats at four and six          weeks after fracture data not shown This response to          treatment made these genes unsuitable for normalization          of the expression of the skeletally related genes that          were described above                            Discussion        In this study we have measured mRNA gene expression in        female rats for six weeks after femoral fracture Females        were chosen because female rats do not grow as large as        male rats   This then minimized the difference in body        size between the two ages Young mammals rapidly progress        to fracture healing as we   and others            have shown before In contrast older rats and older humans        heal more slowly      In our earlier studies        comparable rats at one year of age failed to regain normal        skeletal biomechanics within six months of femoral        fracture while younger rats regained normal biomechanics        within four weeks after fracture   In the present        study the goal was to examine possible alterations in        expression of genes related to the BMPs in order to explain        this failure of the older rats to heal promptly Despite        the difference in age all genes studied increased in        expression after fracture followed by a decrease to        baseline values by  weeks after fracture        This decrease in the mRNA gene expression to        undetectable levels at  weeks after fracture was the        major conclusion of this study The decrease occurred in        rats of both ages and was independent of the healing status        of the fractures This was a surprising result and        occurred for both matrix and regulatory genes It was        unexpected since the genes under study were genes needed        for fracture healing We had anticipated that the older        rats would have an upregulation of regulatory gene        expression to attempt to accelerate the healing process We        speculate that this decrease in gene expression is        responsible for the failure of healing to progress more        quickly in the older rats        Our results appear to violate the principle of negative        feedback control over biological processes A slower        healing sequence in older individuals might be caused by a        diminished number of cells available to effect the repair           This inadequate cellular response should lead to        enhanced cytokine signaling by the BMPs to attempt to        elicit a healing response by the bone cells The enhanced        signal should persist until healing is complete The        failure of enhanced BMP expression at four and six weeks        after fracture in the older rats is difficult to explain        It may suggest that there is a constant time of stimulation        of cytokine production following injury rather than        negative feedback control over the process of fracture        healing Injury may initiate a stimulus for bone healing        that leads to enhanced BMP production for only a short        time For the younger rats this time period seems adequate        to allow healing to occur For the older rats a more        prolonged signal may be required The evaluation of this        hypothesis will require additional experimentation        There are changes in the periosteal cell layer with        advancing age   Following fracture there is an        increase in the rate of mitosis in the periosteum near the        fracture site This rate is altered with age Fewer cells        enter mitosis and more time is required for the cells to        undergo mitosis   This may reflect a reduction in the        number of osteogenic stem cells available for skeletal        repair in older individuals   Despite this we have        extracted a similar amount of mRNA from the fracture site        with a similar increase in gene expression in both the        older and the younger rats There was no evidence for a        failure of gene expression for any of the genes studied        thus far in the fracture callus of older rats        The role of the BMPs has been studied in fracture        healing in rats     mice     and rabbits          and in healing of spinal fusions in rabbits   For        the most part these studies were done in younger animals        who heal their bone fractures quickly The rise in        expression of the BMPs in these animals persists for the        entire length of fracture healing through the point of        formation of bridging callus By correlating the gene        upregulation to the stage of fracture healing it gives        the impression that the BMPs are regulating all stages of        fracture healing In contrast we have used age as an        experimental model to slow the process of fracture healing          This serves to separate the various radiographic        stages of fracture healing and allows us to associate        progression of healing with specific sets of upregulated        genes In the present study expression of BMP and BMP        along with the type IA BMP receptor decreased to baseline        prior to the formation of bridging callus This suggests        that there may be a constant time of upregulation of gene        expression following fracture in the rat Fracture is        followed by four weeks of upregulation of the stimulatory        cytokines after fracture and healing must take place        within that window of time if it is to occur The older        rats cannot respond that quickly and fail to complete the        healing process Alternatively these cytokines may only be        needed for the formation of the soft callus Once the soft        callus is formed these genes regress to baseline Other        genes not yet identified may be needed to stimulate the        formation of bridging callus on the scaffold of cartilage        and fibrous tissue formed as part of the soft callus If        the latter hypothesis is correct there should be        expression of other cytokines late in the healing process        to stimulate bone formation We are currently engaged in a        broader search for such genes        In the unfractured bone samples gene expression was        undetectable in the older rats for all of the measured        genes shown in the Figures An exception to this was        osteocalcin for which there was a low basal level of gene        expression in the older rats In contrast the unfractured        bones from the young rats had clearly detectable amplimers        for osteocalcin type I collagen and the type IA BMP        receptor This higher level of basal gene expression        reflected the greater growth rate in the diaphyseal bone of        the younger rats Unfractured bone of both ages lacked        detectable amplimers for type II collagen reflecting the        lack of appreciable cartilage synthesis in the diaphysis of        the long bones        There was a positive S rRNA signal in each sample        This is evidence that the failure to detect amplimers for        both the matrix genes and the BMPrelated genes at  and         weeks after fracture was related to decreased mRNA        expression of these genes The positive S signal would        argue against technical difficulties in detecting        expression in these samples The unstable expression of        housekeeping genes after fracture is not surprising There        is considerable increase in metabolic activity by the bone        cells in response to fracture and there is also a change        in the cell population of the fracture callus in comparison        to intact diaphyseal bone It is not unusual to see change        in the expression of housekeeping genes with large changes        in cell activity             We have considered whether instability could be impeding        fracture healing in these older rats and we cannot find        evidence of it All rats have intramedullary fixation In        addition there has been no evidence of a hypertrophic        callus caused by instability in the femora of the older        rats that fail to reach union Instead after the fracture        is induced there is a slowing in the formation of the soft        callus as revealed by the later peak in type II collagen        There is a more profound slowing of the bony reaction on        the periosteal surface of the femoral diaphysis The young        rats have a visible periosteal reaction at week  while        the older rats do not form mineralized tissue on the        periosteal surface until the fourth week after fracture        Even if instability were present this would not impede        cytokine formation since in a mouse model unstable tibial        fractures were associated with prolonged expression of        Indian hedgehog and BMP          These findings have led us to hypothesize inadequate        cytokine signaling in the older rats to explain the delayed        fracture healing The number of animals used in the present        study while adequate to test for early decreased gene        expression in the older rats was inadequate to compare        each individual time point between the two ages This is        currently being tested in a larger experiment                    Conclusions        In summary middiaphyseal fractures of the femur in        rats were followed by increased mRNA expression for        osteocalcin type I collagen  type II collagen BMP        BMP and the type IA BMP receptor In the younger rats        there was elevated gene expression until fracture healing        occurred In contrast in the older rats fracture healing        was slower so that cytokine gene expression returned to        baseline prior to radiographic or biomechanical healing of        the fractures This decreased expression of boneinductive        genes prior to an adequate biological response suggests the        absence of negative feedback regulation over fracture        healing
