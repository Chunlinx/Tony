          all right we need to discuss the voters   yes   on a national and a local level why do you think the apathy exists i blame it to apathy   i i yeah um i i suspect the apathy is is due to something like people just feeling that that their vote doesnt count anyway i mean why why bother voting if um if your vote wont make a difference so for instance in um the last presidential election im sure a lot of people thought oh Bush is going to win either way why bother voting   why should i go out of my way when it doesnt matter     thats right i think thats and and the other side of the coin is um people saying well if i really like the underdog candidate i still think theyre not going to win so some are saying Dukakis is certainly not going to win why bother voting for him so i think i i think thats a big uh a big a big reason for it how about   oh i think so too and i think the other thing is the news media media puts such a blitz on it that theyve uh had it predetermined with a half of one percent voting you know   um thats true actually i never thought about that that thats a good reason   and i i think the you hear the news you know you start out in the morning and all day you hear the news and by time say you get off work and go to vote you feel like it doesnt make any difference   thats true thats true   due to the overabundance of news we have available to us   umhum that   what do you think on the local elections though   i think on the local elections its actually um i think um i think people vote in the larger elections because they feel like well you know the countrys real important and you know if i elect if we help elect a president whos going to save us then the then the whole country will be saved but they figure local elections dont mean that much i suspect so people dont really worry about their local mayor or something figuring that you know um and i think wrongly figuring that that well what good is another mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now and you know and stuff like that so people think that that that they dont have um that that it doesnt doesnt matter as much whereas i think its probably just the opposite is true i think its probably the case that people could have more effect on a local level   oh i think so too absolutely uh i think another thing and uh im making a judgment here that may or may i think it is totally wrong well   uh   i think that the people that are um have um a lower income which you automatically equate with lower education   right   tend not to be registered and they dont register and they dont understand that you cant go and vote and register all at the same time or when it gets down to the point of someone saying are you going to vote today they say well i would   um right but   and i believe in this but   yeah that thats possible i still think that that a lot of those people are the ones who really think that their votes dont make a difference though as well i think its those same people who dont know any better about how we vote are are are a lot of the people who think that well look at me im just a little nobody my votes not going to count anyway you know and i think thats probably a portion of the population thats massively under represented i i i would guess that that that portion of the population is massively under represented and   i had an interesting comment one time a thought that would never have crossed my mind i had someone tell me that i will never register to vote because i dont serve on a jury     hum what do they have to do with one another   thats i i i just i that i just wandered off from that one i was just so surprised and amazed with the statement that they say only registered voters can be picked for jury selection   oh so they didnt want to wind up being a juror ever   so they were if they dont vote they dont have to be on a jury   oh i didnt realize that actually that   there is convoluted logic for you   yeah there is there there there are much easier ways to get out of jury duty   yes   just go in and say oh i want to be a juror i can spot a guilty person a mile away   oh i just right right there are so many other ways but that one just it defeated me i didnt have any answer for that one that one was just beyond my imagination   well that that just seems to be a person who just doesnt care about much of anything around sort of you know doesnt doesnt sort of likes rights probably but doesnt like responsibilities responsibilities no i think   thats a good point youre probably right   i mean thats thats what it what it boils down to is people like to say you know people say well i dont want to be on jury you know i dont want to serve on jury duty i dont want to vote i dont want to do this and that well then they could you know i put them in the reverse situation in the place where they dont have the right to be on jury duty and and they dont have the right to vote i suspect their opinions would change very quickly   which and that was what i was thinking exactly about because in the Soviet Union they had an election and they had what like a ninety eight percent turnout   yes   a massive turnout at last someone wants us to vote they were standing in lines to vote   yes they were they were doing that unfortunately what what they were they had they had no idea what they were voting on it turns out   and their vote didnt count   thats right but but its the thought they all got out but you wonder if you know if if now the next election they have if only half of them are actually going to show up or how many generations it will take until only half of the voters show up in Russia   or any one shows up   right that thats true   total indifference you know what difference does it make back gone the full circle   right now if things go the way that that that they are there i think that theyll keep voting but i think theyll wind up like us at some point where people sort of only half of them will end up voting and sort of caring enough to really make a statement so you know i think i think that that the people who most need to vote sometimes are the are the ones who who are really out to make a statement because you know when when when youve got an underdog candidate who represents something and even if he doesnt win a large number of people voting for that particular candidate does i think make a statement to everyone else   oh certainly theres a message there even if they lose   i think that yeah i think and i i think thats real important   oh and i think women turn out to vote for women too   thats probably true   yeah yeah i think well i know its true you see a lot of that you know rally behind the female she may lose but by golly were going to make a statement here   yeah hum thats good thats thats thats thats actually real good   you know   i said well well actually actually the the female who i would most rally behind right now right i dont know much about her politics thats about a way the way she makes speeches is a is a local person for you is Ann Richards   oh okay   i dont know her politics i just know that uh i saw her speak in the eighty four Democratic uh convention and right then and there if they said to me vote for someone for president i would have slapped down my vote for Ann Richards   was was that the time no that was later eighty four thats too soon she said something about uh Ginger Rogers did did everything Fred Astaire did and she did it backwards in high heels   thats very good   she said that i didnt said you know dont tell me what women can do   that thats thats thats very good thats i i like that so i would uh i would i would vote for her without and i i suspect she could get a large voter turnout   i think i did vote for her as a matter of fact im pretty sure i did   say i i i would think that um that that people like that i think inflammatory inflammatory politicians are um or or emotional politicians you know certain very vibrant politicians tend to bring crowds out i think i would hope   well and some of the issues are so emotional   umhum   you know some of the really the really emotional ones have you followed the Dallas elections on zoning   no oh ive heard of it but not necessarily ive heard its very controversial though   i everyone has made so many statements i dont live in Dallas county   umhum   but ive heard so many statements that ive lost track   hum   i honestly at this point its its just too blown out of proportion for everyone you really even the news you cannot follow   yes   what the story the actual facts are at this point i dont i dont really know if some of the poor judges that are just trying to decide how it should be divided   umhum thats what umhum   i wonder about them at some point   hum hum hum well theyre elected as well so   thats correct     so   and thats another and thats another interesting question should judges be elected or appointed   so theyre going to be but thats thats true thats true well   are they politicians   well in some sense they they should be politicians in that you know you want them to respect the people and you dont want them to have you dont want a judge to be appointed because you dont want someones friend to be a judge   sure   but on the other hand   or you want to take the other side of it you can argue thats one of those you can pick either side and we could spend a lot of time on it because   right thats right   its its difficult   umhum   its situational really   so how do you think we can get people to vote   uh uh   ive had one idea that i think is is is completely undoable but it but i think it but but i suspect it would work and the way to do it is to get an absolutely atrocious candidate who you never expect to win to go out and make inflammatory and ridiculous and stupid statements so that a large population of of of voters will go out and vote against that person for someone else so given a choice between you know so so if you have so if if imagine a world where you have two real candidates and one idiot who goes out and makes you know anti you know sort of um   oh   anti women statements anti Semitic statements anti black statements et cetera et cetera well then i suspect a lot of people would go out and choose a candidate to vote for just just to spite that person but i suspect that that that would actually never work   hum well this is true this is true i was worrying uh along the lines of you get everytime someone puts in a ballot in a ballot box   umhum   a dollar bill comes out the bottom   thats an interesting notion   that might work in some places   that that that that that would be interesting yes i think that would work in some places yeah
