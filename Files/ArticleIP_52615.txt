                                 A Fireless Chat            WASHINGTON DCHistory records that the first telephone conversation in was an urgent request for an inperson meeting Mr Watson come here I wantyou Alexander Graham Bell is supposed to have said to his assistant in thenext room Monday night Bill Clinton participated in what was billed as thefirst presidential Internet chat an event intended to showcase anotherepochmaking technology in a larval stage Clinton was more patient than BellHe resisted the urge to say what must have been on the mind of nearly everyonepresent at the minute demonstration Why dont we turn this damn thing offand have a real conversation            Theidea for the Town HallChat cosponsored by the Democratic Leadership Council and Excite was todemonstrate how the Net enables new forms of democratic communication Hereshow it worked Clinton sat onstage in a small auditorium at George WashingtonUniversity accompanied by Al From the president of the DLC Clinton and Fromhad a screen in front of them From read aloud questions sent in by email andClinton answered Also wired in to the session were five other governmentofficials in remote locations around the country and Mark Andreessen thefounder of Netscape In theory virtual participants could watch streamingvideo of the event listen to an audio simulcast or watch a scrolling texttranscription all over the Internet            Inpractice the technology was pretty clunky Due to network congestion thevoices of two of the officials didnt come through at all and others wereeither timedelayed or so distorted as to be barely audible At times the townhall dissolved into a series of Hello Watson can you hear me exchangesClinton read his prepared opening remarks in which he compared the event toone of FDRs fireside chats from a teleprompter If you were watching this onthe Web the herkyjerky streaming video of his head and torso represented agiant leap backward from the straightforward TV broadcast on CSPAN And thescrolling text which was transcribed not by voicerecognition software but byhuman secretaries was hardly a hightech marvel The overall effect was thatof primitive videoconferencing In a way it made you marvel at how far wehavent come since FDRs day            Whenthe technology did work as intended it merely made you wonder what good it isanyhow Having a meeting over the Internet is still like walking to the mailboxin a pound spacesuit That it can be doneimpressive But why do it at allgiven that the quality of the interaction is so poor As in all Internetevents Ive ever seen or participated in the time lags and unfamiliarity ofthe basic structure sucked any spontaneity and most of the oxygen from theroom            Partof the fault was not technical but human and political In theory the Internetallows for a vast range of queries from far and wide In practice questionsfor the president were so carefully vetted as to be far narrower in range thanwhat he might have encountered from a small homogenous and friendly audiencelike the one in the hall The questions were in fact triplescreened first bythe Excite staff which weeded out anything with the word Monica in it thenby the DLC staff with a bias toward substance and finally by From who choosefrom among those culled for him The messages that got passed on to Clintonwere wonky and sincere dealing in an unchallenging way with matters like freetrade and health care One of the few sparks of interest was a question aboutwhether Clinton if he didnt live in the White House would put aside food fora possible YK catastrophe The president said he wouldnt because he doesntanticipate any serious problems            Beforelong Clinton was pointing at questions drifting by on his screen begging formore difficult ones The event might have worked slightly better if he had beengiven a mouse to flag questions he wanted to answer or a keyboard to sendmessages back to the control room But this too would have riskedembarrassment since Clinton is an acknowledged computer illiterate and canttype Nonetheless he does appear to have gained a sense of how the Internetmight someday be democratically useful In his closing remarks Clinton made apoint about how isolated a president can become from the public despite hisbest intentions to keep in touch and how the new technology might help Then hethanked everyone for coming to his press conference            Clinton is right that his successor  will have a real tool to maintaincontact with ordinary people Its too late for Clinton himself He could havelearned how to use a computer of course but I dont think electronic politicsholds any appeal for him You cant seduce a voter in an email message ToClinton the political is the interpersonal the hand on the shoulder theintent gaze the fleck of spittle in the eye Even on television he canprovide a simulacrum of this human experience But on the Internetcommunication is far more abstract Email bores himand it showed The mostinteresting part of last nights event was what happened after it ended whenyou got to see Clinton doing what he does like no one else schmoozing livepeople I eavesdropped as he massaged the ego of Tom Jermoluk the CEO ofExcite I know this may have cost you arm and a leg but I think you may haverevolutionized politics Clinton confided to him            At the end of unsuccessfulcyberevents everyone always praises them as historic Perhaps so though Ithink history will remember them as fumbling experiments that pointed in adifferent direction At this point they testify mainly to the capacity of theInternet to take something interestinglike a discussion with PresidentClintonand make it unbearably dull But be patient In five years or soadvances in technology may get us to the point where an Internet Town Meetingis almost as interesting as a Town Meeting without the Internet
