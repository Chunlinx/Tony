                    Background        The human disorder of sitosterolemia also known as        phytosterolemia MIM  is an autosomal recessive        disorder characterized by the marked elevation of plasma        phytosterols eg sitosterol campesterol and        stigmasterol      Hypercholesterolemia primarily        during childhood accelerated atherosclerosis in some adult        patients leading to premature death as well a hemolytic        anaemia arthralgias and tendon and tuberous xanthoma        formations are other clinical features Studies have shown        that the sitosterolemic patients hyperabsorb all sterols        cholesterol and phytosterols and fail to excrete        phytosterols into bile         Positional mapping        of the         STSL locus to human chromosome p        led to the identification of two genes ATP binding        cassette ABC halftransporters G and G that were        mutated in affected individuals         The        protein products of these two genes sterolin and        sterolin respectively are thought to form heterodimers        to constitute a functional transporter based primarily on        the genetic evidence that affected individuals are either        completely mutated in sterolin or sterolin but not        both     More recently evidence from in vitro        expression of these proteins has been presented that these        two proteins coimmunoprecipitate supporting this        conclusion     ABCG and ABCG appear to be present in        all mammalian genomes examined to date and are highly        conserved between species indicating that these genes may        have a similar function in other species In order to        identify naturally occurring animal models of        sitosterolemia we previously reported a screen of         inbred mouse strains     This screen showed        considerable genetic variation at these loci in the mouse        strains but none of these strains exhibited        sitosterolemia However a literature search revealed that        a few strains of rats studied primarily for investigation        of hypertension and stroke have been reported to be        sitosterolemic as well      We hypothesised that        these rat strains may be mutated in either         Abcg or         Abcg  Tissue and plasma plant        sterol levels in the Wistar Kyoto WKY rat the        spontaneously hypertensive rat SHR and the strokeprone        spontaneously hypertensive rat SHRSP were significantly        higher than in Wistar and WKA rats fed either a regular        chow diet or diets that have higher plant sterols and these        were correlated with increased death or red cell hemolysis        etc            Dietary sterol        absorption rates were increased with a decrease in sterol        excretion     characteristics similar to that observed        in sitosterolemic patients        In this study we report the gene structure        organisation cDNA and tissue expression patterns of rat         Abcg and         Abcg  Using fluorescence in situ        hybridization the rat         STSL locus was assigned to the        chromosomal q Interestingly a cluster of  blood        pressure BP quantitative trait loci QTL in GH  BN F        with LOD scores  tail BP and  intraarterial BP        has also been reported to map to rat chromosome  between         DMit and         DMit  an area containing the         STSL locus We interrogated this        region for genetic variations and found a correlation        between sitosterolemic strains and a missense mutation in         Abcg                     Methods                  DNA Samples of rat strains          The DNA samples from the following rat strains were

      specific for rat cDNA and a rat intestinal cDNA library          was screened by anchor PCR          Direct sequencing of the PCR products led to the          identification of rat cDNA sequence

analysed using the comparative threshold          cycle method CT method Briefly the CT values were          averaged from triplicate determinations defining a CT          value calculated by taking the average CT of the gene of          interest and subtracting it from the average CT of GAPDH          The CT was calculated by subtracting the average          CTcalibrator values from the CTsample

cDNA sequences for           Abcg and           Abcg were isolated and          characterized as indicated in Methods Based upon the          known conservation between the murine and human           STSL loci     we designed          oligonucleotides in putative exonic regions and used PCR          amplification of rat genomic region to characterise the          genome organisation Figure shows a summary composite of          the genomic organisation The intronexon boundary          sequences are indicated in Table  In keeping with the          human and mouse           STSL loci the rat           Abcg and           Abcg genes are arranged in a          headtohead configuration with a distance of  bp          separating their respective initiation codons The exact          start transcriptional sites for either gene has not been          definitively established Comparison of the DNA sequence          of isolated cDNAs as well as the polypeptide sequence          with human and mouse sequences revealed a very high          degree of homology  To assign the chromosomal          location we performed FISH analyses and we were able to          unambiguously map the rat           STSL locus to chromosome q Fig           There is specific labelling of both chromatids of          both homologues of rat chromosome RNO  Fig Aand          B Based on the DAPIbanding pattern the           Abcg and           Abcg genes were sublocalized to          RNOq The           STSL locus was mapped to the same          position as shown by the diagrammatic representation of          the rat Chr  as shown in Fig  The human           ABCG and           ABCG genes are present in a group          of  genes           ABCG ABCG SLCA PRKR GCKR KHK          PPPCB APOB POMC SDC MYCN DDX VSNL RRM ODC          ID TPO and           ACP in the region HSApp and          this group is also present on RNO Thus the           ABCG and           ABCG genes fit into a group of          genes that are syntenic both in HSA and in RNO A          conserved segment between HSA RNO and MMU on          RNOqq has been demonstrated by ZooFISH analysis          and gene mapping data confirming this synteny                                         Expression patterns of rat Abcgand          AbcgmRNAs          Rat           Abcg and           Abcg mRNA expression patterns were          determined using a commercial multiple tissue poly A          Northern filter Expression appeared mainly to be          confined to the liver Fig A with dominant          transcripts sizes of  kb for           Abcg and of  kb for           Abcg  However the poly A RNA          loaded onto this Northern blot has been adjusted to          obtain an identical actin signal and the intestinal          RNA loaded may thus have less enterocyte RNA Using a          more sensitive RTPCR analyses of RNA obtained from          different tissues confirmed that rat           Abcg and           Abcg genes were expressed in both          in the liver and small intestine with a low level of          expression in the colon Fig B          Additionally while screening an enterocyte cDNA          library for full length cDNAs using PCR we consistently          amplified two DNA products when using           Abcg primers flanking exon  one          of the expected size and another very low copy product           bases larger Direct sequencing of these products          confirmed both of these contained           Abcg rat cDNA sequences but the          larger product contained a  bp insertion resulting in          a predicted inframe addition of  amino acids between          exons  and  To confirm that this insertion resulted          from an alternatively spliced mRNA we amplified and          sequenced the intragenic region between exons  and  and          identified a  bp exon exon b flanked by canonical          splicesites see Table and Fig  We next screened          total liver and intestinal RNA using RTPCR from SD          SHR and WKY rats Fig  In all samples a larger DNA          fragment of low abundance was identified Fig  and          direct sequencing showed that these fragments contained          exon b sequences data not shown It is not established          whether these transcripts are a result of aberrant          splicing or are translated and code for a slightly          larger sterolin Careful interrogation of the mouse and          human genomic sequences did not identify any homologous          sequences suggesting this is unique to the rat          Additionally both the mouse and human           Abcg genes have alternatively          spliced mRNA involving a CAG repeat at exon  and exon           splice acceptor sites respectively      However          despite the presence of such a repeat at the rat exon           splice acceptor site for           Abcg Table  none of the rat          mRNAs showed any heterogeneity of splicesite selection          at this site                          Hypertensive rats have sitosterolemia and a          missense change in Abcg          A number of different groups have reported that          genetically hypertensive strains of rats SHR SHRSP          WKY have elevated levels of plasma sitosterol                     Although the WKY strain is not          considered hypertensive dietary alterations involving          plant sterols appear to increase blood pressure in this          strain     We screened two commercially available          hypertensive rats as well as a genetically          hypertensive strain GH for plasma plant sterol levels          and compared these to two control strains SpragueDawley          and Wistar Table  Our analyses confirmed that WKY          and SHR are sitosterolemic on a chow diet but neither          the control strains nor the GH rat showed any          significant differences          To identify if alterations at the           STSL locus could account for these          observations we amplified and directly sequenced           Abcg and           Abcg from Wistar SpragueDawley          WKY WKA GH SHR and SHRSP rats Table shows a          compilation of both coding and noncoding alterations          detected There were  polymorphic changes detected in           Abcg and  polymorphic changes in                    Abcg  However only one          nonsynonymous nucleotide change GT resulting in a          conservative cysteine substitution for glycine at amino          acid  GlyCys in sterolin was identified Fig          A This mutation was only detected in SHR SHRSP and          WKY rats and was present in all of these strains as a          homozygous change Table  These hypertensive strains          also shared uniquely  other nucleotide changes not          present in the other strains Table  These latter          changes were confined to intronic areas and the UTR          region Although the intronic changes are unlikely to          alter the biology of these genes the  UTR insertion in                    Abcg mRNA could be important if          message stability were affected This possibility was not          formally investigated          The identified GT GlyCys missense mutation of          the           Abcg generates loss of a          restriction site for           Hae III after PCR amplification of          exon  and this allowed a PCRRFLP assay to further          confirm the detected change Figure B Note that the          DNA chosen from a single Wistar rat was heterozygous for          almost all of these changes The amino acid G is          conserved between all known mammalian sterolin proteins          Fig C and its alteration may have functional          consequences as it is also conserved in evolution being          conserved in the Fugu fish Fig C Fugu sterolin          shows a  homology to rat sterolin at the amino acid          level and its gene structure is also organized in a          similar fashion data not shown Currently a gap in the          Fugu genomic sequence has not been completed that may          encode for exon  The complete Fugu           STSL locus is available online          GenBank No CAAB          In           Abcg  a large insertional          polymorphism was identified in exon  that resulted in          the insertion of  nucleotides in the UTR          insnt WKY SHR SHRSP and GH rats are          homozygous Sprague Dawley and WKA strains wildtype and          the Wistar sample heterozygous for this polymorphism          Fig                           Comparison of expression of Abcgand Abcgin          hypertensive rat strains          Expression levels of           Abcg and           Abcg in these rat strains were          examined in two ways For mRNA expression quantitative          real time PCR was utilised and for protein western          blotting analyses as well as immunohistochemistry was          employed Fig shows the results of the real time PCR          assays of liver RNAs from fasted animals Using GAPDH          mRNA expression as a control expression of           Abcg and           Abcg mRNAs appeared to be          increased in liver from SHR compared to Sprague Dawley          Fig  the message for Cyp a except for Wistar and          WKY HMG CoA reductase SRB and SREBP except for          SHR were relatively unchanged Interestingly the          message for LDLR was reduced in both WKY and SHR          livers          To compare protein expression levels of the sterolins          we performed western blotting A reliable antibody to          sterolin was available only and was used to probe liver          microsomal lysates from Sprague Dawley SHR and Wistar          rats Fig  Although equal amounts of microsomal          protein lysates were loaded from the livers of these          different strains we consistently observed that the          protein expression patterns were always different between          SHR and the control strains Fig  panel C cf tracks            and  Thus all of the data were normalised in one          of two ways either by using total microsomal protein or          by using the intensity of transferrin signal after          western blotting Both of these methods gave consistent          results and indicated that expression of           Abcg was increased approximately          fold in the SHR but not the Wistar or SD Fig  To          further assess if the mutant protein is mistargeted we          performed immunolocalization using an antipeptide          rabbit antibody on various rat liver and intestinal          sections Fig  We did not observe any differences          between the staining patterns observed for the control          rat strains Wistar or SD and the mutant hypertensive          strains SHR SHRSP Interestingly we observed a clear          apical staining pattern for           Abcg in the intestine and this was          not altered in the mutant strains Fig  panel B                            Discussion        Recent studies on ABC transporters have significantly        advanced our understanding of intestinal sterol absorption        and biliary excretion     Sterols are essential        constituents of cellular membranes in human animals and        plants In humans and animals cholesterol is the sterol        that is synthesised absorbed and utilised whereas plants        do not synthesise cholesterol but use molecules that are        similar such as sitosterol campesterol and stigmasterol        Although similar amounts of cholesterol and plant sterols        are present in the typical human diet the intestine of        normal subjects provides an efficient barrier against the        absorption of the majority of plant sterols     On        average   of dietary plant sterols are absorbed        and retained compared with  of dietary cholesterol             Thus in healthy individuals there exists an        exquisite mechanism that allows the body to distinguish        between cholesterol and noncholesterol sterols ABCG and        ABCG are two genes located adjacently in a headtohead        configuration on human chromosome p encoding for two        halftransporters sterolin  and sterolin  respectively              Mutations in either of these genes causes        sitosterolemia characterized by hyperabsorption of        phytosterols reduced excretion of sterols into the bile        and very elevated levels of plasma plant sterol levels In        sitosterolemic patients the absorption of phytosterols in        intestine is dramatically increased with absorption of        plant sterols to about the same extent  as        cholesterol        Interestingly a similar wholebody accumulation of        plant sterols less severe than in human sitosterolemia        has been reported recently in SHR SHRSP and WKY rats but        not in the other genetically related rat strains such as        SD Wistar and WKA rats     These rats exhibit defects        at two levels increased absorption of sterols plant and        animal at the intestinal level and decreased excretion of        sterols into bile     The higher sterol absorption in        the intestine and the lower biliary excretion of plant        sterols in these rat strains led us to hypothesise that         Abcg or         Abcg gene mutations may be        responsible for the sitosterolemia observed in these        hypertensive rats        Characterization of the rat         STSL locus showed that it is highly        conserved in organization and maps to rat chromosome q        a region also syntenic with the mouse and human         STSL loci Rat         Abcg and         Abcg are expressed in a        tissuespecific manner with expression confined to the        liver and the intestine We sequenced the         STSL loci in sitosterolemic and        control rat strains and identified a number of nucleotide        changes Most of these nucleotide changes were in intronic        regions and based upon their locations are likely to be        silent However one change GT in exon  was        identified that led to a coding change of GlyCys in        sterolin          Abcg  This change was found only        in rat strains that were confirmed to be sitosterolemic        WKY SHR and SHRSP but not in any of the other strains        screened SD Wistar WKA GH or BN        The significance of other genetic variances in         Abcg and         Abcg in different rat strains        documented in this study is presently unknown Plant sterol        metabolism has been extensively evaluated in different rat        strains but the accumulation of plant sterols occurs only        in SHR SHRSP and WKY rats The predicted  transmembrane        domain model of sterolin indicates that the GlyCys        missense mutation is located within the third extracellular        loop residues  in a conserved region Fig C and        is adjacent to two potential         N glycosylation sites residues         and  Thus a mutation at residue  could disrupt the        first site Finally both the sterolin and sterolin are        cysteinerich proteins  cysteines in sterolin  and         in sterolin  five of these cyteines in sterolin are        present in the extracellular loop containing the mutation        It is tempting to speculate that the gain of an additional        cysteine in sterolin by the GlyCys missense mutation        might affect intracellular trafficking or the        heterodimerization with sterolin This possibility is        diminished but not eliminated by the demonstration that in        both the mutant and control rats         Abcg is located apically in the        intestine Fig  Evidence that sterolin and sterolin        may heterodimerize has now been presented based upon in        vitro analyses     However our preliminary analyses        of immunohistochemistry using an antibody to sterolin        suggests that the pattern of expression in the liver and        intestine is similar for both SD as well as WKY or SHR rats        Fig  These studies are limited in scope as antibody        reagents to detect rat sterolin are not currently        available        Another formal possibility not excluded is that the        GlyCys missense mutation may have no significance in the        accumulation of phytosterols in WKY SHR and SHRSP and        that the alteration in the  UTR or even the intronic        changes reported above may be the causative mutations        Our analyses of the mRNA and protein profiles would not        strongly support these possibilities However further        investigation will be required to determine if the base        insertion in the predicted UTR of         Abcg has any functional consequence        In the absence of a direct assay for sterolin and         function the genetic changes presented together with the        correlation of the phenotypes remains the strongest        evidence that these genetic alterations are functional and        that the GlyCys is a mutational change        A more relevant question raised in this study is whether        the plant sterol accumulation in hypertensive rat strains        has significance in the pathophysiology of hypertension        Recent linkage mapping studies mapped hypertension QTLs to        a number of chromosomal regions in SHR and SHRSP rats            Our FISH study assigned the         STSL locus rat chromosome q a        region where a cluster of blood pressure QTL with Lod score         has been reported to be present MMITMMIT  cM        distance in a New Zealand genetically hypertensive rat GH        rat     With respect to hypertension although the        SHR and SHRSP strains carry the GlyCys mutation in        extensive QTL mapping studies using these strains no loci        mapping to the rat         STSL region have been reported            In our study the GH rat is neither sitosterolemic nor        has any nucleotide alteration at the         STSL locus that would implicate this        region as mutated Thus we do not believe the         STSL locus plays a role in        determining blood pressure However it may play a        significant role in modifying the pathophysiology        Studies reported by different investigators have shown        that a dietary intake of   canola oil as part of        semipurified diets significantly shortened the lifespan        of SHRSP rats with accumulation of phytosterols in plasma        red blood cells and tissues          Lower        red blood cell RBC membrane deformability lower density        of platelets as well as a higher blood pressure were also        observed when compared to a SHRSP group fed with vegetable        oils lower in phytosterols   soybean oil         vs  canola oil Canola oil has a        higher sitosterol content than soybean oil In comparison        extensive studies on evaluation of high phytosterol diets        in SD rats nonsitosterolemic have consistently shown to        be safe without any adverse consequences                  These intriguing differences between SHRSP and SD        rats may now be explained at least in part by presence of        the GlyCys missense mutation in sterolin The WKY rat        also carries this mutation and a high dietary intake of        phytosterols will also increase the blood pressure and        decrease the density of platelets though to a lower extent        than that observed in SHRSP rats     These data        support a pathological role of elevated plant sterols in        these rats and support the notion that the         STSL loci evolved to not only allow        for the excretion of cholesterol into bile but also to        keep xenosterols from accumulating in the body With        respect to sitosterolemia in humans although        atherosclerotic complications have been welldescribed        hypertension has not been mentioned as feature However it        is not known whether the atherosclerosis in sitosterolemic        patients with hypertension is accelerated relative to        those affected individuals with lower blood pressures        The GlyCys mutation in         Abcg is likely to have originated in        the original outbred Wistar colony bred in Kyoto from        which WKY was subsequently derived which has been widely        employed as a normotensive control in experimental studies        of hypertension It gave rise to the SHR and SHRSP strains        Thus this mutation in WKY SHR and SHRSP lines may not        contribute to the hypertension phenotype         per se  but may only be responsible        for sitosterolemia The original Wistar colony was        established at the Wistar Institute in  and the        Sprague Dawley colony was derived by Dawley in        approximately  from a single male of unknown origin and        a Wistar female The SHR strain was derived by selective        inbreeding from the Kyoto outbred Wistar colony and both        SHR and SHRSP as well as WKY strains have been maintained        over many generations through brothersister matings        httprgdmcwedutoolsstrains      Healthy WKA        and GH rat strains were also generated from outbred Wistar        rat strains but these strains were isolated independently        in Japan and New Zealand respectively and maintained at        other sites as well The GH rat was selected for systolic        hypertension that increased with successive generations and        maintained through filial matings     In view of this        the GlyCys missense mutation of         Abcg might result from occurrence of        a         de novo mutation during breeding at        the stage of developing inbred WKY strains and propagated        into the SHR and SHRSP lines In contrast the         nucleotide fragment insertion polymorphism in the UTR of                Abcg may have resulted from        acquisition of a foreign chromosomal fragment during the        Wistar rat strain breeding and established as homozygous        change in the WKY SHR and SHRSP as well as GH rat        strains In this context it is important to note that         other mutant loci have been reported in the SHR rat        missense mutations in the         KAT kynurenine        aminotransferase         Srebf sterol regulatory element        binding factor and         CD fatty acid translocase are all        present as homozygous changes       The generation        of congenic lines may assist with addressing many of these        issues Such lines will be useful in demonstrating that the        variant sterolin protein is responsible for causing        sitosterolemia but will allow comparisons between animals        that are hypertensive and those that are hypertensive and        sitosterolemic Currently there are no appropriate genetic        controls available as SHR SHRSP and WKY are all        maintained as colonies by brothersister matings While        this manuscript was in review Scoggan         et al also reported identifying        GlyCys alteration in         Abcg of SHR SHRP and WKY rats                               Conclusion        Three rat strain WKY SHR and SHRSP that are        hypertensive are also sitosterolemic All of these strains        are homozygous mutant for GlyCys in sterolin encoded        by         Abcg  This mutation is not present        in rats that were not sitosterolemic even though one of        these was hypertensive the GH rat The rat         STSL locus comprising of         Abcg and         Abcg  maps to rat chromosome q        a region syntenic with both mouse and human         STSL loci Preliminary antibody        studies show that this mutant protein is expressed and        appears to be apically targeted in the intestinal
