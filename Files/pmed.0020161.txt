                    Introduction        Embryonic stem ES cells are pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass of the        blastocyst that can be maintained in culture for an extended period of time without losing        differentiation potential The successful isolation of human ES cells hESCs has raised        the hope that these cells may provide a universal tissue source to treat many human        diseases However directed differentiation of hESCs into specific tissue types poses a        formidable challenge Protocols are currently available for only a few cell types mostly        of neural identity  and differentiation into many of the cell types derived from the        paraxial mesoderm has not been reported with the exception of a recent study indicating        osteoblastic differentiation  Mesenchymal stem cells MSCs have been isolated from the        adult bone marrow  adipose tissue  and dermis and other connective tissues         Harvesting MSCs from any of these sources requires invasive procedures and the availability        of a suitable donor The number of MSCs that can be obtained from a single donor is        limited and the capacity of these cells for longterm proliferation is rather poor In        contrast hESCs could provide an unlimited number of specialized cells In this study we        present techniques for the generation and purification of mesenchymal precursors from hESCs        and their directed differentiation in vitro into various mesenchymal derivatives including        skeletal myoblasts Our isolation method for mesenchymal precursors is the first example        to our knowledge of efficiently deriving structures of the paraxial mesoderm from ES        cells and further highlights the potential of hESCs for basic biology and regenerative        medicine                    Methods                  Cell Culture and FACS          Undifferentiated hESCs H WA XY passages  and H WA XX passages           were cultured on

using MAS Affymetrix software Transcripts selectively expressed in each            of the mesenchymal cell populations MSC hESMPCH and hESMPCH were defined as            those called increased by the MAS algorithm in each of three comparisons with            independent samples of undifferentiated hESCs A Venn diagram was generated to            visualize overlap in gene expression Further statistical analyses were performed as            described below                                      Results        Mesenchymal differentiation of hESCs lines H WA and H WA  was induced        by plating undifferentiated hESCs on a monolayer of murine OP stromal cells  in the        presence of  heatinactivated FBS in alpha MEM medium OP cells have been previously        shown to induce blood cell differentiation from mouse ES cells  After  d of        coculture cells were harvested and sorted by FACS for CD a surface marker expressed in        adult MSCs  Figure A An average of  CD cells was obtained from the mixed        culture of OP and differentiated hESC progeny CD cells were replated in the absence of        stromal feeders on tissue culture plates and expanded in alpha MEM medium with  FBS for         d We next established the membrane antigen profile of the resulting population of        flat spindlelike cells The H and Hderived CD cells expressed a comprehensive set        of markers that are considered to define adult MSCs including CDSH STRO VCAM        CD CDintegrin  CD ICAM CD ALCAMCD vimentin and alpha smooth        muscle actin Figure B and C The cells were negative for hematopoietic markers such as        CD CD and CD They were also negative for neuroectodermal epithelial and muscle        cell markers including nestin pancytokeratin and desmin data not shown The human        identity of these presumed mesenchymal cells termed hESMPCH H H H and        H was confirmed for all experiments by immunocytochemistry for human nuclear antigen        to rule out the possibility of contamination with OP cells Figure S        To further characterize hESMPCs we performed genomewide expression analysis using        oligonucleotide arrays Affymetrix UA The expression profiles of hESMPCH and        hESMPCH were compared with that of human primary adult MSCs Housekeeping genes for        each of the mesenchymal cell populations were eliminated by subtracting those transcripts        also expressed in at least one of three independent samples of undifferentiated hESCs        Based on this analysis  transcripts were selectively expressed in hESMPCH         transcripts in hESMPCH and  transcripts in primary adult MSCs A remarkable        overlap of  transcripts shared among the three mesenchymal populations was observed        Figure D Using the genes that were selected in the initial filter we performed a        statistical analysis on the expression levels to determine whether the genes were expressed        significantly differently in the two cell types We used a Bayesian extension to the        standard         t test  to assess this difference Of the  genes  of them        were significantly different at a false discovery rate cutoff of  The relative fold        changes were also extremely large in many of the cases We also looked at the variance of        the expression levels within the cell types For the MSCs  had a coefficient of        variation less than  for the expression log transformed for the ESderived cells         had a coefficient of variation less than  Numerous known MSC markers were included in        the list of  genes such as the         mesenchymal stem cell protein DSC fold increase         p           neuropilin  fold increase         p           hepatocyte growth factor fold increase         p           forkhead box D fold increase         p   and         notch homolog  fold increase         p    Table S lists the         p values from the test the mean and standard deviation of the        expression levels and the relative fold change of all  genes between the two types        Known markers of MSCs such as mesenchymal stem cell protein DSC were all included        within the  shared transcripts These findings support the immunocytochemical data and        suggest that hESMPCs and primary MSCs are highly related        MSCs are characterized functionally by their ability to differentiate into mesenchymal        tissues such as fat cartilage and bone Therefore we tested whether hESMPCs have the        same potential Figure         Adipocytic differentiation of hESMPCs was induced under conditions described previously        for primary adult MSCs  Appearance of cells harboring fat granules was observed after         d in culture After  wk of induction more than  of the cells displayed Oil Red        O fat granules and         PPAR a marker of adipocytic differentiation was detected by RTPCR        Figure A        Chondrocytic differentiation was achieved using the pellet culture system  After         d in culture more than  of all cells exhibited robust staining for Alcian Blue a        marker specific for extracellular matrix proteoglycans Chondrocytic differentiation was        confirmed by the gene expression of         collagen II and         aggrecan  two components of extracellular matrix selectively expressed        by chondrocytes using RTPCR Figure B        Osteogenic differentiation was induced in the presence of glycerolphosphate         Osteogenesis was demonstrated by specific staining for calcium deposition in the matrix        von Kossa Figure C or Alizarin Red Figure SA and increased expression of         bonespecific alkaline phosphatase and         bone sialoprotein at day  of treatment Figures C and SB At day         Alizarin Red staining was detected in approximately  of all cells Throughout these        studies human adult MSCs and foreskin fibroblasts were used as positive and negative        controls respectively        In addition to adipocytic chondrocytic and osteogenic differentiation reports        suggested that adult MSCs can form skeletal muscle  Although generation of skeletal        muscle cells from adult MSCs remains controversial we tested whether hESMPCs exhibit this        potential Under the conditions previously described  hESMPCH and H did not        yield significant numbers of MyoD cells after  d in culture However when confluent        cells were maintained in culture in the presence or absence of AzaC without passage for        more than  d expression of specific skeletal muscle markers such as MyoD and fastswitch        myosin was observed Figure A More rapid myogenic differentiation was obtained in the        presence of hconditioned medium from the murine myoblastic cell line CC previously        induced to form myotubes  Direct coculture of hESMPCs with CC cells led to the        formation of hESMPCderived myotubes as visualized by expression of human nuclear antigen        Figure B similar to those formed by host CC cells After  wk of coculture myotubes        composed of human nuclei accounted for more than  of the total number of human cells        present and each human myotube was composed of up to ten human nuclei Human cell        contribution to myotubes in coculture was confirmed by expression of human musclespecific        transcripts such as         MyoD myosin heavy chain IIa  and         myogenin data not shown These data demonstrate that hESMPCs can give        rise to mesenchymal derivatives typically obtained from primary adult MSCs as well as to        cells expressing markers of skeletal muscle        One concern for the clinical application of hESCderived progeny in regenerative        medicine is the risk of teratoma formation due to the presence of residual undifferentiated        ES cells among the differentiated progeny We did not detect markers of undifferentiated        hESCs such as         Nanog  or         Oct  in any of the hESMPCs by RTPCR see Figure D and        immunocytochemistry data not shown suggesting the lack of any undifferentiated ES cells        in hESMPC cultures However future in vivo studies are required to rule out the potential        of these cells for teratoma formation                    Discussion        Previous studies have demonstrated the derivation of neural cells  hematopoietic         and endothelial lineages  and cardiomyocytes  from hESCs This study presents        the induction of paraxial mesoderm with the generation of multipotent mesenchymal        precursors We calculate that under these conditions a single undifferentiated hESC yields        an average of one CD cell at day  of differentiation suggesting a balance between        cell proliferation and cell selection There were no obvious differences in marker and        geneexpression profile or in differentiation behavior among the five hESMPC lines        generated However some of the lines eg hESMPC exhibited a tendency of spontaneous        osteogenic differentiation after longterm propagation Directed differentiation of hESCs        into somatic stemcelllike precursors represents a substantial advancement in harnessing        the developmental potential of hESCs The high purity unlimited availability and        multipotentiality of hESMPCs will provide the basis for future therapeutic efforts using        these cells in preclinical animal models of disease Such in vivo studies will also be        required to properly assess the safety profile of these cells Furthermore our system also        offers a novel platform to study basic mechanisms of mesodermal induction and        differentiation during early human development                    Supporting Information                  Accession Numbers          The Gene Expression Omnibus GEO httpwwwncbinlmnihgovgeo accession
