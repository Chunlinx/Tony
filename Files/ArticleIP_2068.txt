appeared  years ago inNewsweek MiddleClass Junkies Aug   with language thatreads as fresh today as it did then We learn that heroin has breached itsghetto quarantine Children of affluence are venturing where once the poorand desperate nodded out The drug is being retailed at rock clubs atHollywood parties and among lunchtime crowds in predominately white businessdistricts As always part of the problem is a glut of white powder Sheerabundance is prompting concern about a potential epidemic spilling acrossdemographic divides And heroin purity is increasing dramatically Puritylevels as high as  percent have been found in seized wholesale caches withstreetlevel purities averaging up to  percentaround six times the typicalstrength of the  Turkish blend            Having hit  percent years ago you wouldnt think that heroin purity could keep rising But for thepress it has The Washington Post s story about Melvoin reported thatheroin purity has risen from as low as  percent in past decades to upward of percent today while the Los Angeles Times  piece noted that heroinhad gone from  percent purity in  to  percent in  After Melvoindied the Associated Press reported that the heroin he shot was  percent to percent pure            Depending on where you drop the Nexis plumb line you can find references tomore potent street heroin in the recent past A  New York Timesstory pegged the potency of heroin at  percent In  the WashingtonPost placed average purity at  percent to  percent A SeattleTimes story from  quoted a Drug Enforcement Administration source whosaid that in the s heroin was typically  percent to  percent pure butthat heroin seized in the early s was now topping the scales at  percentpure A  government study puts purity at  percent so if the DEA wasright a few years ago recent purity actually has declined somewhat            There is good evidence that potency isnt the mostsignificant risk factor in overdose deaths A study of heroin overdoses inWashington DC the findings of which were published by the Journal ofForensic Sciences  found no relationship between heroin purity anddeathbyoverdose or nonfatal overdose On the night that Melvoin shot that to  percent heroin and died Pumpkins drummer Jimmy Chamberlin shot the samejunk and survived The researchers attributed most overdoses to intermittentor postaddiction use of heroinmeaning that people who ODd tended tomisjudge tolerance when returning to the drug Another risk factor that nevergets enough ink in the heroinobsessed media is the danger of using heroin incombination with alcohol The mixture has an additive effect A drinker couldspike himself with a lowerthanlethal dose and still OD            What do we really knowabout heroin use For one thing the federal governments National Drug ControlStrategy for  says that the addict population is basically stable Itreports that the number of casual users less than weekly of heroin camedown by nearly half between  and   to  the most recentyear measured while the number of heavy users at least weekly dipped from to  One statistic feeding the heroin revival stories is theincreasing number of emergencyroom visits by people who mention heroin as areason for seeking ER treatment But the statistics which come from thegovernments latest Drug Abuse Warning Network DAWN survey come with adisclaimer suggesting that the explanation may be multiple visits by agingdruggies who are using the ER for a variety of health problems            My bet is that when themedical examiner releases his report on Jonathan Melvoin next week it willdisclose that the smashed pumpkin was drinking booze while shooting a fatalerror that pres addicts almost never made Well learn that Melvoinlikethe presswas an amateur who didnt really know what
