          Lucille Hughes   okay Lucille im Ron Ron Moore   all right and what did   and our topic okay our topic was did you hear our topic all right basketball i guess im probably a lot like you im a Dallas Maverick fan   yes umhum well i certainly am too now tell me what you expect from the Mavericks this year   well unfortunately unfortunately i dont expect a great deal out of them they just have too many problems too many ailments too many hurt bones and maybe too much age at this point you know when Roy Tarpley just now he messed up on them it just hurt them so bad i feel like everyone else i feel sorry for Donald Carter and the owners of the team and the management of team and everyone else it just seems like   um   they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possibly be a a final a final team playing for for all of it national championship or the world championship and something like this happens   yes yes sir ah well do you think its time that we go for new uh coaches is that part of our problem   yeah i think at this time were just in a a rebuilding type of phase you know i think that probably would be evident with the more and more the more and more young guys they draft   well it just its its its so discouraging that they cant really i mean theyre entitled to more than theyve been able to do so far i im awfully sorry that the Mavericks cant come on and and do Roy whos your next best team or who do you like after the Mavericks   oh gosh im so much of a Magerick Maverick fan i dont know probably the Boston Celtics ive just always liked the Boston Celtics they have a they have a similar situation now that a lot of uh old guys on the team and but theyre still playing good ball but im a ive always been a Boston Celtic fan too but   well   you know ive lived in Texas since seventy four so being a transplanted Texan in in the Dallas area i have to stick with those Dallas Mavericks   we certainly need to support them do we not do you go to the game   yes we do you know yes i go to a few games i havent been to many im not a season ticket holder or anything i was a season ticket holder of the Cowboys for years and   well   when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school college and doing their own thing sort of gets boring going by yourself   yes it does im sure it would its such a monstrous place down there but um maybe next maybe they can do some i dont know who do they need to trade   oh you bet well i dont know it seems like  Rolando Blackman and and Harper sort of carry the team they just i dont know if im afraid to say thats probably who they need to trade to get someone in there good but and that can really help the team but they do that they trade the nucleus of their power right now   yes sir it seems that way to me i course i dont know any of the newer ones that they have and im not well of versed on their capabilities but we really need to do something   well you know i feel like uh the best they can hope for this year is probably ah an opportunity to make the playoffs i like their coach i really like Richie a lot and i just i think he deserves a good break he deserves a healthy team so they can really see what he can do for the club and i think Donald Carter the owner i think with all hes invested he deserves a a healthy team for one year and a good break also this thing with Roy Tarpley it just upset everyone i think fans owners management everyone   i really yes sir and they have just done as much as they can for that man and he apparently cant straighten his act out so we need to to build on something more positive than that   you bet i think theyre fools if they ever bring him back   oh i do too i certainly would agree to that   hate to put it that way i just would not believe him anymore   well it um i mean you cant give  anyone too many chances  and i think he has gone over the limit   no theres an old saying you can lead you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink so and i think Tarpleys just a sad case but to be making ah a million dollars a year thats pretty sad   thats right well it is tragic i dont um i mean were gonna have to do something about all of these fabulous salaries theyre paying to all of our athletes i think   oh i think youre right everything just been put out of perspective now you know you take a a young kid Roy Tarpleys age id say he was twenty one when he came into the league and and now hes probably an old age of uh twenty five or six   uh it yes sir   and making all that money well thats uh thats quite a thats a little more of a challenge for a young man than they they need at that point in their life i think   i think youre right i believe that one so   so so i think you know its created by
