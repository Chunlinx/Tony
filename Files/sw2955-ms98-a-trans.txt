              well i guess it depends on what age im in the thirty something so i know i mean i lived through it uh are you old enough to know about the war   um just barely yeah im uh twenty nine so uh   oh okay well yeah youre old enough but it was on the fringe   yes but just uh yeah exactly had some friends over that were that were in it   it ended when i was in uh college in uh when i turned nineteen in nineteen seventy i cant even remember at this point um when i turned nineteen it was the year that uh the draft was still going on if i had been a male or in Israel id have been number two   really   yeah  so i learned a lesson in gender  um in terms of the war i dont know um   wowie uhhuh   see actually i dont really know that much about it i just know socially the impact it had here and what you hear in the media you know um i guess i think it was  not that great that we were in there um in terms of for how long it lasted   right   you know what do you think   umhum well i think its uh basically the same way its certainly has affected uh US policy though theres no question it had an overwhelming effect of how we approached the the thing in uh Iraq   umhum umhum   because uh the whole thing that was bad about Vietnam was no different from Iraq i mean it was uh one country picking on a smaller weaker one   right the devastation yeah   yeah the only difference was that the government said okay if were going to support this smaller country then were going to support it a hundred percent and were going to consider ourselves against in war against these people as well   umhum yeah and in full faction yeah   which uh right which really wasnt the attitude with Vietnam it was sort of a presidents war rather than a countrys war   yeah it just kind of dragged on um i dont know how you were historically but i was was a little bit older before i realized just how long it had been going on since LBJ and i mean i had yeah   right yeah it seemed to me like it was it seemed like it was going on forever yeah   it really well yeah in fact because in terms of when your theres at least ten years between us so in terms of when you were in school im sure that it was you know the majority of your high school and junior high years um   umhum   one of the things i didnt like was the weapon the weapons i cant even say it the weaponry that systems that they used um it just didnt seem that um   yeah   i dont know technically we knew what we were doing either then you heard about the things like agent orange et cetera and youd think   right   you know just uh how could the government or the Pentagon uh whomever whomevers in charge there been so careless   yeah right   um   of course now  uh now everyones more uh you know environmentally uh intelligent than they were back then i mean back then it wasnt commonly known that saccharin was bad for you and all these other  things that people   conscious yeah Nutrisweet yeah and all these other things thats true uh   that people know about themselves now   um monetarily too i just dont think weve done enough for the uh Vietnamese people as a whole um in South Vietnam in general in helping them restore themselves   umhum   you know and i dont know if its because there arent any oil fields there   yeah i dont know if they uh i dont know if they have that resource or not   yeah i mean i dont think they do but i just think its kind of a shame that uh you still hear things about the children that are orphans there and um so on a whole i dont know war isnt good and that one i probably um   yeah   my main opinion would be  we shouldnt have done it   right   well thats what i know about the Vietnam War unless you have   yeah  yeah well you know a little uh a little bit more than i do explain it said i didnt uh get to live through it that the people that i know that it did   umhum   uh felt very strongly most of i work for a government contractor so most of the guys i work with are uh well at least some of the guys i work with rather are veterans   umhum umhum oh Vietnam   and uh from Vietnam and i havent talked to any of them that that werent you know glad that they went or or rather thought that the reason they went was a good one   jeez yeah umhum and that that   you know most of them are very very strongly that that the reason for America to be there was a good one they just felt that the way America backed them up wasnt wasnt at all right   uhhuh in terms of the personal yeah the bitterness is more on a personal level than on a   yeah in term of yeah personal level and and the finances how they started you know like air attacks and stuff like that dropped off like crazy because the Congress wouldnt approve you know yeah   uhhuh the moneys after yeah i mean i think it started actually like like in the late fifties i mean like in fifty eight fifty nine   um i i   so it really i mean because i know in nineteen sixty three i mean i was nine years old when Kennedy was shot     umhum   so i mean i remember um right around then that thats when i first started hearing about Vietnam but then as i got older and studied in school i realized it was even going on before that   yeah   you know and you think to yourself oh my goodness Eisenhower  that sounds ancient yeah and i know i know you know a lot of the Vietnam vets that are my age in their later thirties um guys that i know that   yeah right   theyre just kind of bitter you know they they you know i hate to quote that movie Born on the Fourth of July but its that kind of idea   uhhuh   you know they just dont feel that socially they were given like a friend of mine called it the yellow ribbon syndrome yeah they werent given the yeah so   right right the ticker tape parade and all that   well i wont keep you anymore thats probably about as much as we both but thanks for talking to me ah yes is that where youre at   okay yes uh were you calling from Texas no im in Falls Church Virginia   oh i know where that is thats beautiful where youre at   yeah right right near DC   DC yeah are you a native of there   ah pretty much yep been   yeah uh Dallas it is uh ninety two degrees here today but at least the humidity is uh below forty percent which makes it kind of like Phoenix   yeah its about the same weather here little bit little bit cooler like eighty nine but basically the same thing   really well you yeah well youre not missing too much then   yeah right   really well take it easy okay byebye   okay byebye
