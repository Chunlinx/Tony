                                  Talking About a Revolution            Kelvin Lancaster died last month He was aneconomists economist famous within the profession when an economist uses theadjective Lancastrian he isnt talking about the Wars of the Roses butlargely unknown beyond it I cant claim to have known him personally I was years old when his famous paper on the theory of the second best waspublished click to read more about it and we probably met only four or fivetimes But nonetheless there was a time a couple of decades ago when we werecomradesinarmswhen he and I along with several dozen other people helpedmake a revolution in economic theory            That revolution went unnoticed among the widerpublic even among those who follow or think that they follow economicthinking David Warsh of the Boston Globe wrote an excellent series ofarticles about some of the revolutionaries and hes in the process offinishing a booklength treatment But other journalists ignored the story orif they did write anything got it wrong preferring cameraready fantasies inwhich heroic outsiders challenged an obtuse Establishment Ive tried elsewhereto correct some of the myths click to read my article on the power ofbiobabble and to read about the legend of Brian Arthur but maybe Lancastersdeath is a good occasion for me to wax nostalgic to recall what actuallydid happen            To understand therevolution you need to grasp two related dichotomies One is that betweenconstant and increasing returns the other between perfect and imperfectcompetition Constant returns is the assumption that if you increase yourinputs your output will grow by the same amounteg if you double yourinputs you will also double your output Increasing returns on the other handsays that doubling inputs will more than double output Perfectcompetition is the assumption that producers are like wheat farmers who takethe price of wheat as a givenand not like say Apple which must decide whatto charge for an iMac and can choose within limits to raise that price if it iswilling to accept a reduction in sales            Perfect competition and constant returns go together likecookies and milk without constant returns the assumption of perfectcompetition becomes very hard to swallow The reason basically is that whenthere are increasing returns an industry will tend to become dominated by atmost a few large players and these players are bound to realize that they havesome pricesetting power They are also likely to realize both that it is intheir common interest to agree at least tacitly to set prices high and thatit is in their individual interest to cheat on that agreement and undercuttheir rivals Is the eventual result a stable cartel a perpetual price war oran irregular alternation between the two Hard to say But what has long beenclear to economists is that increasing returns normally lead to imperfectcompetition and that imperfect competition can be a messy and intractablesubject            That recognition inturn led the profession to spend about a century and a halffrom DavidRicardo until the sconcentrating its theoretical energy on models thatassumed constant returns and perfect competition and economists tended toavoid questions where increasing returns or imperfect competition wereselfevidently crucial In so doing they were neither foolish nor dogmaticMost economists I think understood that increasing returns are sometimesimportant and a few people did try to take them into account In myspecialty international trade theory increasingreturns analysis is usuallydated from a  paper by the Princeton economist Frank Graham the firstfully workedout mathematical model was published by RCO Matthews in But useful theorizing in complex subjects such as economics is always a matterof choosing the right strategic simplification and for a long time it seemedthat the clarity of constantreturnsperfectcompetition analysis justified itsviolence to reality Even now one can sayand I did back in that percent of the time it would be a blessing if politicians could understandwhats right about the constant returns model not whats wrong with it            By the s however patience with constantreturnseconomics was wearing thin Exactly why is hard to say I dont think you canclaim that returns were less constant or competition less perfect in the realworld of  than they had been in  or even  More likely thedriving force was the fields internal intellectual logic Economists hadanswered most of the interesting questions they could ask in the old frameworkand found that constantreturns economics was running into well diminishingreturns And so they were finally ready to try something different            Kelvin Lancaster was oneof those who was driven to increasing returns In the s he had introduced aseemingly obvious but highly useful twist to the analysis of consumer behaviorby pointing out that what consumers often want is not so much a specificproduct as a particular bundle of characteristics To take a modern examplewhat business travelers care about in their notebook computers are low weightlong battery life and high computing power rather than the logo on the caseThere are tradeoffs among these good things what differentiates one notebookfrom another is where in this characteristics space they are located But inthat case why doesnt the market produce every possible notebook Much as Ilove my HewlettPackard Jornada handheld Id prefer a machine with a slightlybetter word processor for which I would happily sacrifice something else Theanswer of course is increasing returns To proliferate varieties and henceto produce each variety at a smaller scale means to increase costs            Now at this point Lancaster found himself up against theusual problem Increasing returns mean imperfect competition and in generalimperfect competition is nasty stuff But somehow circa  economists wentthrough a shift in mindset My colleague Robert Solow likes to say that thereare two kinds of economists those who look for general results and those wholook for illuminating examples And more or less suddenly fell into the secondgroup they decided that while a general theory of how imperfect competitionmust work was never going to happen it was OK to focus on interestingexamples of how it might work How does the market for an industry withLancastertype differentiated products function It could be dominated by asingle firm that proliferates products to deter potential competitorsOK DickSchmalensee wrote up that story Or it could be monopolistically competitiveeach variety produced by a different firmOK Steve Salop wrote that up in oneversion Mike Spence in another Avinash Dixit and Joe Stiglitz in yet anotherThe point was to find stories that hung together not determine once and forall which was right            Its hard to convey ifyou werent there just how liberating this was Once they decided it was OK totell illustrative stories rather than produce theorems economists could writeabout exciting topics that had been off limits predatory pricing strategicinvestment to get the jump on competition technological races struggles todefine industry standards By  when Jean Tirole published his landmarktextbook The Theory of Industrial Organization  just about every ideaabout the new economy that trendy writers proclaim as a radical departurefrom conventional economic thought was well already in the textbook            Among other things someone was bound to notice that theinteraction between increasing returns and product differentiation could helpexplain some puzzles about international tradelike why most trade is betweenseemingly similar countries In the late s three people independently wroteup that insight the Norwegian economist Victor Norman Lancaster himself andyours truly and the new trade theory was born A few years later economistssuch as Paul Romer and Philippe Aghion applied related ideas to technologicalchange and economic growth giving birth to the new growth theory and theripples spread ever outward            Alas golden ages do end By the early s thethrill of increasingreturns economics was fading It wasnt just theinexorable working of the law of diminishing disciples There was a deeperproblem The new ideas were immensely liberating but at some point you can gettoo liberated In international trade people started to joke that asmart graduate student could come up with a model to justify any policysimilar sentiments were felt in many fields In short we all got tired ofclever analyses of what might happen and throughout economics there was ashift in focus away from theorizing toward data collection and carefulstatistical analysis            But it was a golden agea time ofinnovation and intellectual excitement when all of economics seemed up forreinventionand Kelvin Lancaster was one of those who made it so Let us honorhis memory
