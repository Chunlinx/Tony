                                 Highbrow Tribalism            In American foreignpolicycircles everyone is waiting for the next X X was the byline on the famous essay in Foreign Affairs  actually written by George Kennan thatanalyzed Soviet communism and laid out the postWorld War II policy ofcontainment Where is a comparably compelling vision of the postCold Warworld a new lodestar for American foreign policy Who is the next GeorgeKennan Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington has a suggestion Howabout him            Huntingtons The Clash ofCivilizations and the Remaking of World Order is now hitting thebookstores The jacket copy says that the germ of the bookHuntingtons Foreign Affairs essay The Clash of Civilizationsdrew morediscussion than any Foreign Affairs piece since Kennans at leastaccording to the editors of that distinguished journal Blurbs fromBrzenzinski effusive and Kissinger guarded reinforce the air ofeminence            Huntingtons book is devoted to a currently ubiquitous theme tribalism Inpolitics the tribal theme shows up in the rhetoric of Pat Buchanan VladimirZhirinovsky JeanMarie Le Pen and so on In the intellectual world thetribal theme shows up in treatises about the importance of the sentimentsaroused by such men Now that the bipolar order of the Cold War is gone weretold the primal bonds of ethnicity language and religion will be acentralif not the centralorganizing principle in world affairs Huntingtoncarries this idea to new heights of theoretical elaboration Surely tribalismhas never sounded so cerebral But its one thing to analyze a phenomenon andanother thing to encourage it Huntington crosses the line so easily as to makeyou wonder How different really are the lowbrow and highbrow expressions ofthe vogue for tribalism            Huntingtons  essay was by design a downer The endof the Cold War had inspired such upbeat visions as the inexorable triumph ofliberal democracy Francis Fukuyamas The End of History  and the NewWorld Order global peace mediated by the United Nations Huntington insistedwe recork the champagne The world would remain strifetorn he said only nowthe main actors would be not ideological blocs or nationstates or superpowersbut distinct civilizationsWestern Islamic Confucian JapaneseSlavicOrthodox Latin American Hindu and African In the book he adds aninth civilization Buddhist Civilizations are the ultimate human tribesand the clash of civilizations is tribal conflict on a global scale he writesin the book Relations between nations from different civilizations will bealmost never close and often hostiletrust and friendship will be rareWars will tend to break out along civilizational fault lines and will tend toexpand along the same lines            How should we respond to thistribalism Tribally The very survival of the West depends on Westernersuniting to renew and preserve their civilization against challenges fromnonWestern societies Thus Australia should abandon efforts to mesh with itslocal Asian milieu and instead should join NAFTA The United States shoulddeemphasize engagement with Asia and turn back toward Europe            How exactly Huntingtonsdiagnosis perilously deep fault lines leads to his prescription furtherdeepen the fault lines is a puzzle to which well return But first a wordabout the diagnosis Does his notion of civilizations as tribes writ largemake sense            Back in most commentators said no and this book is unlikely to change theirminds For example Huntington has renamed Confucian civilization Sinicbut that doesnt tidy up the concept South Korea North Korea Taiwan ChinaSingapore and Vietnam are very motley and definitely not a crew In fact thethriving capitalist democracies of South Korea and Taiwan seem to blatantlyviolate Huntingtons logic showing how fast cultures can switch orientationsfrom one civilization to another Yet Huntington not only sees hiddencoherence in the Sinic bloc he sees the bloc as part of an even largerthreatthe ConfucianIslamic connection This consists of China and NorthKorea cooperating with Pakistan Iran Iraq Syria Libya and Algeria tothwart the West on such issues as arms proliferation But the grab bag ofnational policies that supposedly add up to this grand transnationalconnection doesnt even include most Sinic or most Islamic states If wewanted to use one variable to predict whether a nation is involved inHuntingons SinicIslamic connection wed be better off knowing whether itsone of the four remaining Communist dictatorships than knowing whether its oneof the five Sinic nations  percent predictive power vs  percent            I could  as others have about thecivilizational paradigms lack of analytical elegance But thats not whatreally bothers me Though ancestral cultures arent the mystical epoxy thatHuntington imagines language religion and other aspects of cultural heritagedo matter a lot in the postCold War world The civilizations part ofHuntingtons thesis is less troubling than the clash part Why is it aninherent property of intercivilizational relations that they be usually cooland often hostile Why for example must Western relations with a Sinic blocbe typically tense Obviously current WesternChinese relations arepretty tense But why cant this change with say a new more cosmopolitanregime in China or firmer and more consistent diplomatic signals fromWashington            It isnt enough to say asHuntington does that Sinic civilization lacks the Wests bent for democracyThe clich that democracy hobbles the conduct of a coherent foreign policy istrue If Chinese leaders are freed from the burden of domestic pandering theyshould be able to calmly find their zones of common interest with the West andcut the appropriate deals So why does Huntington think we cant do businesswith these people Are only Westerners capable of perceiving their rationalselfinterest and acting on it Are only Westerners reliable negotiators            SometimesHuntington seems to think so After criticizing naive American attempts atconstructive engagement and dialogue across the Pacific he writes To theAsians American concessions are not to be reciprocated they are to beexploited Ah yes those wily Asians Pat Buchanan couldnt have said itbetter Here again Huntington conflates with other explanatoryvariables            Huntingtonlike Buchananclaims not to be a culturalsupremacist He is defending the integrity of all cultures theirs and oursIndeed he sounds almost like a lefty relativist when he says we must acceptglobal multiculturality and discard the linear view of history which seesWestern values as the inexorable fate of humankind But of course thats justanother way of saying that liberal democracya value Huntington surely ranksabove the alternatives morallymay never fit some peoples as naturally as itfits us In this light the meaning of his call to maintain themulticivilizational character of global politics seems clear separate butequal You let one alien nation move into your trade bloc and pretty soon thewhole neighborhood goes downhill And already Huntington worries the West issuffering decline and decay            The Barbarians in short areat the gateand conspiring against us The future Huntington says may boildown to the West against the rest Raise the drawbridges            And yettoward the end of this book just when I was about to file Huntington in thePat Buchanan section of my brain he underwent a miraculous transformationUp until this point he has been ignoring or downplaying the interdependenceamong modern nations He doesnt seem to think the Chinese reliance on Westernmarkets say or Hong Kongs thirst for Western capital can help keeptransPacific relations smooth And God knows he doesnt waste time talkingabout environmental problems soluble only by international cooperation On thecontrary hovering like white noise throughout his  essay and through muchof this book is the that international relations are typically zerosum sothat natural conflicts of interest dominate world affairs            But then in the books final few pagesHuntington does his sudden turnaround and finally sees what he missed in It is in the interests of civilizations not just to coexist but to activelycooperate We live in a world not just of transnational corporations but oftransnational mafias and drug cartels problems that nations can solve onlyby acting in concert In the books final paragraph he repeats that in theclash of civilizations Europe and America will hang together or hangseparately but he adds that in the greater clash the global clashbetween chaos and order the worlds great civilizations  will also hangtogether or hang separately Huntington who set out in  to debunk the NewWorld Order is suddenly talking like Boutros BoutrosGhali            On behalf of oneworlderseverywhere I celebrate Huntingtons Road to Damascus experience and officiallydisassociate him from Pat Buchanan But before we teach him the secret NewWorld Order handshake wed like him to resolve some paradoxes in his thinkingIn particular the tension between his prescriptions of a the West turninginward for its own salvation and b the worlds different tribes cooperatingfor global salvation Clearly the first can complicate the second If forexample America focuses on nourishing its European kinship and is wary ofjoining Pacific regional organizations then building a bridge to Asia will betricky            One can imagine another bookthat would synthesize and elaborate the of this one For example Huntingtonsuggests putting an Islamic nation on the UN Security Councilan interestingidea and proof that thinking civilizationally or at least culturally hasits uses But the growing academic fad of thinking in primarily almostobsessively tribal terms is another matter In addition to being analyticallysloppy it can become a selffulfilling prophecy Huntington notes as evidenceof tribalism that foreign investment in America encounters more hostility whenits Japanese than when its Canadian Regrettably this is true But onereason its true is because Huntington and other tribalism aficionados spend somuch time talking about people from other civilizations as if they lived onanother planet Turns out they dont
