                                 The Iowa Democratic Debate Remembering Lenny            I now understand why Gore wants to debate so much On his better days hesdamned good at it In todays Des Moines Register debate in Iowa Gorewas truly formidable performing better than he has in any of his five previousencounters with Bill Bradley To be sure Gore was demagogic gimmicky andcondescending at timeshe cant help it But he was also lethalthroughout            Gores most devastating shot came with the help of what I believe may be atechnical innovation in presidential debating the use of human props As heput a question about agriculture to Bradley Gore asked a member of theaudience named Chris Peterson to stand Peterson Gore explained was an Iowafarmer with  acres  of which were flooded in  Bradley Gore notedvoted in the Senate against emergency federal aid for those affected Why didyou vote against disaster relief for Chris Peterson Gore asked             Bradley who should have been prepared to defend this vote simply had noanswer at all to the question of why he wanted to drown this friendly lookingfarmer along with his hogs and beans He tried to play Gores question off withthe lame bromide that the candidates should be talking not about the past butabout the future When Gore came back at him again with the question Bradleyirrelevantly asserted that he supported the federal tax subsidy for ethanolBradley was so clearly nailed on this failingtopander charge that Gore wasable to resist his usual urge to flog a dead horse and didnt bring it up athird time            Though Gores use of Peterson and of a public schoolteacher he had also planted in the audience was compelling I dont think itwill lead to any good When Ronald Reagan introduced a similar device in hisfirst State of the Union address in by inviting Lenny Skutnik agovernment employee who dived into the Potomac to rescue a survivor of anairplane accidentit was a nice touch  Since then though theheroesinthegallery gambit has gotten completely out of hand turning theState of the Union address into a version of the Grammys for people who cantsing            Gore did one other notably shrewd thing this afternoon Responding toBradleys bunker mentality charge from the last debate he finally stood upand took credit for the record of the Clinton administration The other nightin a debate Sen Bradley criticized me and other Democrats for being in whathe called a Washington bunker Gore said in his opening statement So I wantto start by telling you what we were doing in that Washington bunker Wecreated  million new jobs cut the welfare rolls in half passed the toughestgun control in a generation and created the strongest economy in the historyof the United States of America             I was wondering when Gore was going to get around to sticking up for thepresident Running away from Clinton as Gore has been doing makes the liabilityof Clinton fatigue into a selffulfilling prophecy But embracing Clintonsaccomplishments plays to what I consider to be Gores single greatest asset asa candidate that he represents the continuation of Clintons popular andsuccessful policies without the continuation of Clinton himself
