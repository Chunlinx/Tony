                    Background        DNA microarrays have emerged as a powerful tool to        monitor the transcript levels of thousands of genes        simultaneously      This parallel analysis permits        tumor prognosis and classification      drug target        validation     toxicology evaluations      and        functional discovery             The microarray fabrication method can play a key role in        the performance of a DNA microarray platform For example        oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes can be covalently attached        to a surface     synthesized         in situ       or retained        via electrostatic interactions with a positively charged        surface     A recent study examining the effect of        mismatches along the length of         in situ synthesized  mer        oligodeoxyribonucleotides demonstrated a lack of an effect        of mismatches for the first ten to fifteen bases at the         surface end of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide suggesting        that these bases may not be accessible during the        hybridization reaction     Other problems may exist        when oligodeoxyribonucleotides are adsorbed to a        positivelycharged surface Oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes        have been found to form duplexes with nonhelical        properties on positively charged surfaces     These        duplexes are highly asymmetrical and unwound possibly        incurring a significant loss in base stacking which may        subsequently affect the energetics of duplex formation        Such noncanonical structures may not be restricted to        oligodeoxyribonucleotide arrays Spotting of amplified        cDNAs onto glass is another method commonly used to        fabricate arrays     Interestingly multistranded DNA        structures have been found to form on the surface of such        arrays     Furthermore a low concentration of        amplified cDNA in the dispense plate can generate a        compression in the expression ratios underscoring the        importance of this parameter     Although PCR        preparation is not a factor in the fabrication of        oligodeoxyribonucleotide arrays a similar problem exists        namely surface probe density Probe density may result in        steric effects    and could affect the efficiency of        duplex formation and kinetics of target capture                   The microarray hybridization conditions can also affect        the performance of a DNA microarray platform An early        study on DNA microarray hybridization found that        hybridization was strongly dependent on the rate constants        for DNA adsorptiondesorption in the nonprobe covered        regions of the surface the twodimensional diffusion        coefficient and the size of probes and targets and also        suggested that sparse probe coverage may provide results        equal to or better than those obtained with a surface        totally covered with DNA probes     A theoretical        analysis of the kinetics of DNA hybridization demonstrated        that diffusion was important in determining the time of        required to reach equilibrium and was proportional to the        equilibrium binding constant and to the concentration of        binding sites     A recent theoretical and        experimental analysis of competitive hybridization in a        twocolor system demonstrated the need for the        hybridization kinetics of the two probes to be the same            An elegant study on the use of hybridization        kinetics to differentiate specific from nonspecific        binding was recently published     This study found        that the hybridization kinetics for specific and        nonspecific binding of labeled cRNA to surfacebound        oligodeoxyribonucleotides were significantly different        with specific binding requiring longer to reach        hybridization equilibrium than nonspecific binding This        property was exploited to estimate and correct for the        level of hybridization contributed by nonspecific binding        enabling the selection of optimal oligodeoxyribonucleotides        and the reduction of false positives in exon        identification Lastly a longer hybridization time was        previously shown to marginally increase relative        fluorescence potentially increasing detection of rare        transcripts            Lastly oligodeoxyribonucleotide length can impact the        performance of a DNA microarray platform Early studies        with high density arrays suggested the use of  mer         in situ synthesized        oligodeoxyribonucleotides     A more recent study using        covalently attached oligodeoxyribonucleotides found that         and  mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides generated signals        two to fivefold higher than  mers and signals obtained        form  mers were only twofold higher than those obtained        from  mers but tenfold higher than those obtained from         mers     In fact         in situ synthesized  mer        oligodeoxyribonucleotides hybridized in  formamide        have been shown to represent a compromise between maximal        sensitivity and specificity compared to other lengths and        hybridization conditions     Lastly a study employing                in situ synthesis via maskless        photolithography demonstrated an increase in signal        intensity with increasing oligodeoxyribonucleotide length        up to  mers followed by a plateau above that length                   Besides the effects on performance parameters such as        sensitivity and specificity fabrication methods can also        affect the accuracy of a microarray platform A        sophisticated analysis of the Affymetrix platform was        recently presented     The authors used a relative        error calculation to describe the dependence of the        accuracy of the platform on the number of probe pairs per        transcript Furthermore data was gathered but not        presented regarding the increase in the relative error as        a function of the foldchange expression ratio Such        issues are important in all microarray platforms and impact        oligodeoxyribonucleotide design as well as microarray data        interpretation        Thus it is apparent that many factors can impact the        performance of a microarray system and that these factors        should be assessed prior to gathering large amounts of        microarray data The fact that the hybridization kinetics        of specific and nonspecific binding differ    raises        the questions what is the optimal hybridization time and        could the hybridization time affect the accuracy of        microarray data Moreover in order to take advantage of        the large body of solutionphase hybridization data when        designing oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes for microarrays        and when optimizing hybridization conditions the probes        attached to the microarray surface or matrix must show        solutionphase hybridization properties In this report we        show solutionphase hybridization behavior on a        threedimensional microarray surface    and demonstrate        that hybridization conditions specifically the time        allowed for hybridization can impact the accuracy of        foldchange calculations                    Results        The specificity on the CodeLink platform was previously        demonstrated to result in less than  of the initial        signal being retained when a base mismatch is present in        the middle of the mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe            We used this information to test whether the DNARNA        duplex formation is affected by the probes attachment to        the DNA microarray surface and to determine how much of the        probe is accessible for hybridization A series of base        and base mismatches were designed across the length of        mer probes to assess its availability for hybridization        Labeled cRNA prepared from total RNA isolated from kidney        was hybridized to DNA microarrays consisting of a series of        base and base mismatches across the length of mer        probes containing the mismatches Fig  The profile of        these mismatches showed that mismatches near the         solution or  surface end of the probe affected the        hybridization signal nearly equivalently demonstrating        that the surface did not generate steric effects in the        hybridization For example M showed a symmetrical        profile with the greatest effect of the mismatches in the        middle of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide Figure A M        showed approximately eight bases at the  solution end        which exhibited only a small effect of mismatches Figure        B This lack of an effect could be due to the fact that        the mismatches at those positions did not significantly        destabilize the duplex or due to the effect of the surface        The latter possibility is unlikely but will be addressed        later Lastly NM showed approximately  bases at the         surface end which did not affect the signal intensity        significantly Figure C This lack of an effect could be        due to the same reasons outlined for Figure B A total of        ten genes were designed and tested in this manner Three of        those are shown in Figure  and the other seven genes        showed patterns similar to those shown in Figure and        therefore were not shown for the sake of brevity        To show that these hybridization results were similar to        a solution phase hybridization melting curve measurements        were taken in solution using a standard        temperaturecontrolled spectrophotometer The T         m of the perfect match and  mismatches        scanning across the mer probe were measured in both the        hybridization buffer and in the stringency wash buffer        Significantly the difference in the T         m measurements T         m  between the perfect match and the        mismatches in solution followed the same pattern as the        decrease in the hybridization signal on the arrays Fig         The strong correlation in the array and solution data        in Figure Bdemonstrate that the mismatches at the  end        of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide did not destabilize the        duplex significantly explaining the lack of a decrease in        the signal intensity of these mismatches compared to the        perfect match Additionally the patterns for the T         m calculations from measurements in the        hybridization buffer data not shown and in the stringency        wash buffer were nearly identical suggesting that both the        hybridization and the stringency wash conditions produced        equivalent stringency Due to the expense of        oligoribonucleotide synthesis a total of two genes both        of which are shown in Figure  were examined for        concordance of microarray and melting temperature data        However all six data points for the first gene and all six        data points for the second gene  out of  or         showed good concordance between the two measures We        conclude that the threedimensional surface enables        solution phasetype hybridization behavior and that most        if not all of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe is        available for hybridization with the target in        solution        The solution phasetype hybridization behavior on the        microarray surface suggested that probes on this surface        should exhibit typical hybridization kinetics where the        reaction rate is dependent on the second order rate        constant the target concentration and the probe        concentration      In other words increases in the        target concentration should generate proportional increases        in the signal intensity We therefore prepared serial        dilutions where four control transcripts were spiked into a        total RNA sample In subsequent samples twofold serial        dilutions of this spiked total RNA into fresh total RNA        generated a dilution series consisting of ten        concentrations of each transcript for a final range of         to   microM to  nM We prepared        labeled cRNA targets from each of these samples and        hybridized them to Codelink microarrays These microarrays        contained three bacterial probes which were designed to        hybridize to each of the four spiked transcripts for a        total of twelve signals six shown in Figure Aand six        shown in Figure B which were measured at each serial        dilution Any errors in the measurements will include all        aspects of the microarray platform We plotted the signal        intensity as a function of the spiked transcript        concentration for oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes on the        array that were complementary to these control transcripts        We found a linear response in the signal intensity from a        transcript concentration of  nM to  microM        approximately three logs Figures Aand B This signal        linearity is consistent with a previously published report        on the Codelink platform     The average R value was        found to be    The fact that all twelve of        these probes  demonstrated this behavior suggests        that this observation is general However we could not        ascertain what portion of the probes which were designed to        measure the endogenous human transcripts showed this        behavior because it is not possible to vary the target        concentration for each of those transcripts in a        controlled quantitative manner In summary these data        verified the array signal was indeed dependent on the        transcript concentration as anticipated They also        demonstrated the precision and low variability of the        entire microarray process target prep labeling        hybridization and detection        Mismatched duplexes generally exhibit larger        dissociation rates than their perfectly matched        counterparts     We therefore examined the effect of        one two and threebase mismatches as a function of        hybridization time in two different probe sequences A        hybridization time course was performed by hybridizing the        same cRNA sample to separate arrays each array hybridized        for different times and examining the hybridization        intensities for endogenous transcripts The data in Figure        demonstrate that the effect of a one and twobase        mismatch is maximal using a hybridization time equal to or        greater than sixteen hours For example in probe sequence        X Figure A the hybridization signal of a onebase        mismatch was  of that of the perfect match after four        hours but was only  of that of the perfect match after        sixteen hours Similarly the hybridization signal of a        twobase mismatch was  of that of the perfect match        after four hours but was only  of that of the perfect        match after sixteen hours Identical results were seen for        the effects of a threebase mismatch data not shown        Consistent with previous findings     the effect of a        onebase mismatch was found to be variable reducing the        hybridization signal to  Figure A or  Figure B        of that of the corresponding perfect match signal Also        consistent with previous findings     a twobase        mismatch had a greater effect reducing the hybridization        signal to  Figure A or  Figure B of that of the        corresponding perfect match signal We note that other        array platforms may generate different effects of        mismatches due to probe length or to the fact that the cRNA        used in our experiments was fragmented to about  bases        Therefore the actual probetarget duplex length was        primarily dictated by the length of the  base probe the        shorter of the two single strands        Two scenarios could generate the increased specificity        with time First at longer hybridization times a greater        proportion of mismatched duplexes versus perfectly matched        duplexes may have dissociated resulting in lower        hybridization intensities for the mismatched duplexes        Secondly the intensity of the perfect match may increase        more significantly than that of the mismatch To determine        whether one or both scenarios exist we plotted the        intensity versus time for the perfect match one base        mismatch and two base mismatch probes Figures Cand D        While the intensity of the perfect match probe for        X increases with time reaching a plateau around         hours the intensity of both the mismatch probes        decreases with time reaching a plateau around  hours        Figure C In contrast while the intensity of the        perfect match probe for X increases by         between  and  hours the intensity of the one base        mismatch probe increases only  between  and  hours        and the intensity of the two base mismatch probe decreases        by  between  and  hours Figure D Thus        specificity can be generated in different ways These data        provide further evidence of solution phase hybridization        behavior in the Codelink microarray system and demonstrate        that short hybridization times could result in decreased        specificity        It is important to note that the data in Figures and        do not address the accuracy of the microarray platform        For example the results in Figure showed a relative error        fold change expected  fold change observedfold change        expected of  which is low compared with higher errors        reported elsewhere     However the data exhibited a        low but consistent compression of the ratios obtained from        comparing the signal obtained from one transcript        concentration to that obtained from the next dilution        Therefore a hybridization time course was performed to        find the time which would generate the lowest compression        in the ratios A simple approach to calculate ratios for        multiple genes at once  genes is to vary the        amount of cRNA used in the hybridization and compare the        calculated and expected ratios of every probe This        approach eliminates bias which might be introduced when        solely using control transcripts and it prevents systematic        errors introduced by the sample preparation method        Importantly the total nucleic acid concentration was kept        constant by varying the amount of labeled cRNA and        supplementing the lower amount of labeled cRNA with        unlabeled cRNA Therefore the only variable in these        experiments was the hybridization time        Using this method a ratio of five would be expected        from each probe if the signal intensity generated from         micrograms of labeled cRNA was compared to that obtained        from  micrograms of labeled cRNA We acknowledge that this        is an oversimplification given that some probes will reach        equilibrium faster than others and that saturation of        pixels may arise for high signals However as a global        approach the compression of the ratio as a function of        the hybridization time was investigated A hybridization        time of  hours generated a ratio of  Fig A        Significant compression was found if the hybridization time        was too short or was too long These results suggested that        hybridization time could affect the accuracy of ratios by        introducing a compression effect at shorter times        How does the hybridization time affect ratios smaller or        larger than five Does this compression effect or the        relative error increase with larger ratios Lastly how do        these data compare with other platforms To address these        questions we repeated the dilution series experiments        presented in Figure but performed the hybridization for         hours instead of the  hours that were used to generate        the data in Figure  We analyzed both sets of dilution        series data according to the method of Zhou and Abagyan            using the highest concentration of the dilution        series and determining how the relative error changed over        a large range of differential expression ratios We also        analyzed the Affymetrix data from the Zhou and Abagyan        publication in this format We plotted the relative error        as a function of the fold change for the Codelink platform        using either an  or hour hybridization time Figure        B The data points were fit with a second order        polynomial and the R values  and  for the         and hour hybridization times respectively showed a        good fit of the data to the curve Lastly when data from        an analogous Affymetrix experiment were plotted in this        format the relative error also increased as a function of        the fold change The Affymetrix data plotted were based on        twelve to  data points for each expected fold change        thus representing a total of  data points We note that        due to the very different conditions used to generate the        Affymetrix data and to the fact that it is derived from        only one publication these data should not be compared        with the Codelink data However these data do demonstrate        that the increase in relative error with increasing fold        changes may be a common feature of multiple microarray        platforms        The data in Figure Bhighlighted several points First        the data using the spiked control transcripts Figure B        agreed with the data presented in Figure Ausing the        endogenous transcripts when the  and  hour timepoints        were compared and demonstrated that a  hour hybridization        time produced more accurate data less compression or lower        relative error than an  hour hybridization time We note        that the  hour time point in Figure Acan not be compared        to a similar time point in Figure B Secondly a  hour        hybridization time consistently outperformed an  hour        hybridization time with respect to the relative error for        all fold changes examined on the Codelink platform        Thirdly the relative errors in all three conditions        Codelink  and hour and Affymetrix platform        increased with the larger ratios There are two important        points that should accompany these conclusions First        different platforms use different oligonucleotide lengths        from  to  bases in length and even amplified cDNA        products           with different        accessibilities of the arraybound nucleic acid Therefore        it is impossible to generalize that a time which is optimal        on one platform will be optimal on the second platform        Secondly more studies on the Codelink arrays will be        required to verify that  hours is indeed the optimal We        only know that it outperforms the  hour time points We        conclude that a longer hybridization time eg         longer may generate microarray data with lower relative        errors while hybridization times of  hours could        generate more compression and this kinetic parameter        merits further investigation as a simple method to increase        both performance signal intensity and mismatch        specificity and accuracy                    Discussion        Much debate exists regarding the optimal        oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe length However a more        functional way of thinking about the probe length may be        how many bases of the probe are actually available for        hybridization and if these bases are exhibiting solution        phase biophysical behavior In this manner linker length        and surface effects must also be considered For example        bases at the surface end of some         in situ synthesized  base        oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes may not be accessible for        hybridization    while other         in situ synthesized probes may        require linkers for optimal performance     We present        evidence using  base oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes        that most if not all of the probe is available for        hybridization and that the surface does not introduce        significant steric effects We note that the        threedimensional Codelink arrays used in this study are        different from standard surfacebound arrays and        therefore it is not unexpected that the observations        presented in this report are different from those generated        on other array platforms Furthermore we show for the        first time on a microarray platform a strong concordance        of microarray hybridization mismatch data with solution        phase duplex melting experiments Figure         Another important consideration in microarray        experiments is the time allowed for the hybridization        reaction Recent data has shown that specific binding takes        longer to reach equilibrium than nonspecific binding            suggesting that a longer hybridization time may be        beneficial Implicit in such findings is the fact that the        accuracy of a fold change may also increase with a longer        hybridization time We present evidence demonstrating that        hybridization time can in fact increase the accuracy of        expression ratios fold changes relieving the observed        compression in ratios and that this effect may be more        dramatic for larger fold changes Figure  In retrospect        these data make sense from a biophysical perspective        because at the longer hybridization times the mismatched        duplexes will have dissociated due to their faster        dissociation rates Figure  leaving primarily the        perfectly matched duplexes The optimal hybridization time        on different platforms could vary depending on probe        length and accessibility diffusion coefficients and        detection methods but the basic premise of increased        accuracy with increased hybridization time should hold        Thus we believe that this parameter merits further        investigation        Various computational and statistical measures have been        used to improve and filter microarray data For example        locally weighted linear regression lowess normalizations        have been used to correct the systematic dependence of the        log          of the redgreen expression ratios on        hybridization intensity     The finding that        competitive hybridization in a twocolor system requires        the hybridization kinetics of the two targets to be the        same    may help explain the need for such        normalizations Thus understanding the hybridization        behavior of probes and targets in a microarray platform may        obviate the need for large amounts of data        manipulation        Moreover a recent study found that both cDNA and        oligodeoxyribonucleotide arrays underestimated the relative        changes in mRNA expression between experimental and control        samples as determined by quantitative reverse        transcriptase polymerase chain reaction     This        underestimation or ratio compression increased as the        relative change increased consistent with our observations        Figure B Such comparative studies underscore the need        to understand the root causes for ratio compression in        microarray platforms in order to design effective        solutions The fact that specific binding takes longer to        reach equilibrium    and that a longer hybridization        time may alleviate compression in expression ratios this        report is one example of how fundamental studies may        eventually improve microarray data                    Conclusions        The data in this report demonstrate for the first time        a strong concordance between the effect of mismatches in        probes attached to a three dimensional matrix of a        microarray and solutionbased thermodynamic duplex melting        studies Moreover an increased hybridization time was        shown to increase the accuracy of fold changes by relieving        the compression observed in expression ratios and this        effect may be more dramatic for larger fold changes        Studies such as these may ultimately help improve        microarray data quality                    Methods                  Array experiments          Target preparation CodeLink DNA microarray          hybridization and processing were performed as described          previously    except as described A single labeled          nucleotide biotinUTP was used in the cRNA labeling          reactions at a concentration of  mM Unlabeled UTP          was present at  mM while GTP ATP and CTP were at           mM cRNA was fragmented prior to the hybridization          reaction as previously described               Hybridization time studies followed the above procedures          with the following exceptions The first sample consisted          of  ug of labeled cRNA target The second sample          consisted of  ug of labeled cRNA target and  ug of          unlabeled cRNA target for a total of  ug of cRNA Each          target was hybridized to an array for               or  hours          Serial dilutions were prepared by adding the           base transcripts from the           E coli genes           araB  entF           fixA  and           gnd at a final concentration of           M for each transcript in kidney total RNA This  M          dilution was then diluted into kidney total RNA in a          fold series to a lowest concentration of  nM for          each transcript The  nM dilution is approximately          equal to  copy per cell assuming an mRNA population          which is  of the total RNA  mRNAscells and          an average mRNA length of  bases                              Array design          The data shown in Figure were generated using the          mismatch scanning array This array consisted of ten          probe sets where each probe set was designed to hybridize          to either a spiked bacterial transcript or an endogenous          transcript present in a complex human polyA RNA sample          eg from human liver or human brain Each probe set          consisted of the perfect match to the targeted transcript          and two subsets The first subset consisted of thirty          probes each having a twobase mismatch The position of          the mismatch was shifted one base for each probe in this          subset generating a subset of probes with twobase          mismatches scanning the length of the  base sequence          The second subset also consisted of thirty probes each          having a threebase mismatch The position of the          mismatch was shifted one base for each probe in this          subset generating a subset of probes with threebase          mismatches scanning the length of the  base          sequence          The data shown in Figures through were generated          using the Codelink Human Uniset I arrays These arrays          contain  probes representing approximately           unique accession numbers designed to hybridize to human          transcripts present in polyA RNA and approximately           control probes designed to hybridize primarily to          bacterial transcripts The noncontrol probes those          designed to measure relative expression levels of the          endogenous human transcripts were each designed based on          the paradigm of one probe per gene However three to ten          bacterial control probes were designed to hybridize to          each bacterial transcript These bacterial probes can be          used as negative controls or a subset of these can be          used as positive controls when the corresponding          bacterial transcripts are spiked into the human polyA          RNA The latter scenario in which four bacterial          transcripts were spiked into the polyA RNA was used to          generate the data shown in Figure  The hybridization          signal from each of the three bacterial probes on the          array was measured for each of the four spiked          transcripts for a total of twelve signals which were          measured at each serial dilution In addition the set of          control probes contains five probe sets each of which          contain the perfect match one two three and          fourbase mismatches to either a bacterial transcript or          an endogenous human transcript The intensities of these          probe sets was measured after different array          hybridization times to generate the data shown in Figure           Lastly the probes on the Human Uniset I arrays which          were designed to measure the endogenous human transcripts          in polyA RNA were measured after different array          hybridization times and with different amounts of labeled          cRNA to generate the data shown in Figure A The twelve          probes on these arrays which were designed to hybridize          to the four spiked bacterial transcripts were measured          after different hybridization times and with serial          dilutions of the bacterial transcripts to generate the          data shown in Figure B                          T mdetermination          The solutionphase melting temperatures were measured          with an Agilent  UVVIS spectroscopy system with          added Peltier thermostated single cell holder using a           ml quartz cuvette Each probetarget set contained a          perfect DNARNA mer match and  DNARNA pairs with          base mismatches incorporated into the          oligodeoxyribonucleotide The oligoribonucleotides IDT          Technologies were incubated at room temperature with          equimolar amounts of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide in          either in stringency wash solution  mM TrisCl           mM NaCl or in hybridization buffer  formamide           SSPE then the melting profile was performed in C          increments with constant monitoring at  nm The T           m was determined for each DNARNA pair          by calculating the first derivative of the A            profile                            Authors Contributions        DD and AN conducted data analysis and helped with        experimental
