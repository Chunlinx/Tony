            okay uh mandatory service yeah i dont think its a good idea uh because wed have to change the Constitution to  to uh allow uh involuntary servitude uh in service to the government and im not sure that we could do that in such a way that we could avoid winding up a slave state   uhhuh   its i like the idea   and in what way are you talking about   well  i like the idea of voluntary voluntary support i mean they might be able to ah say that anyone who does that uh gets certain benefits that  would not be available to someone who didnt do it   right   but to use force um really sets us a a it it essentially says that your body theres a title to your body and that title belongs to the government and you are not a free American citizen   right yeah right   the idea itself of service is good and when someone is say out of high school and not sure about college or out of college and not ready to go into a career and theyre not committed to huge amounts of debt thats the best time to be able to do work that doesnt pay very well   see i i yeah and i also thought that um that would interfere with with college work and   yeah unless it were tied directly   they didnt yeah   you know if someone were studying something uh lets say take something obscure somebody was studying economics the State Department could offer to send them to the Soviet Union for two years to teach them how to run their country   yeah thats true   as an extreme example right   yeah   but in reality i think what you would wind up with is a political football where they would see all these body counts that they can use to for their own will and i just dont think it would work   when do they assume this is gonna be proposed or mandatory or when when i what what year are they looking at   well theyre not its been suggested and its sort of a topic of debate every time it comes up it gets voted down the uh people who are promilitary oppose it because they dont want people to have the right to opt out of the military into something else   uhhuh umhum yeah   and the people who are proconstitution oppose it on the grounds that the government shouldnt even have the right to enforce you to join the military unless the United States is actually under attack   yeah right   so mostly its just kind of one of those things that goes away  ah theyve got a noisy line   right yeah i thought that was your line   yeah well its somewhere between here and there   uh what age group is are are they looking at   uh oh eighteen the draft age yeah  wait a minute yeah  let me see if i can get on a cleaner line if its my line um   eighteen yeah that seems normally that would interfere with college i would think i moved maybe that is thats part of it   yeah it is my line i was on a radio phone   oh   all right thats better yeah no there they they figure that they can draft you at eighteen age they usually do draft you at nineteen and thats the age theyre looking at   oh hm   and of course theyre this one the women would be equally grabbed and theyre almost on the verge of saying that you if youre gonna draft men youre gonna have to draft women and youre gonna have to put them in front of the guns just the same   right   so uh if youre near that age or you know somebody who is uh you know be aware of that   umhum yeah well thats kind of scary  im not near that age  im way over it but i do have children to think about you know   yeah oh okay yep and you dont want them sent off to the Middle East to help defend Bush from Saddam after Bush gets done arming him   thats kind of scary right   you know we only find out about that a year after the fact   yeah   so its another thing when in doubt dont trust the government at all its really reached that point   oh uhhuh hm   hey youre in Perot country im really thinking that this guy might be good for us   i do too   ive been it it seemed dangerous i thought is the guy a closet fascist and then i find out that he helped rid the United States of the Gablers   hes hes helped out in a lot of ways yeah hes hes from Dallas or hes in the Dallas area and uh hes very well known around here so   yeah well im in the computer biz too so i know hes well known in the industry they uh i i have high hopes for him and i think that you know if he could get people interested and encouraged and to believe that the government was actually for us then im for him   uhhuh yeah i i   i mean in the Democratic primary im gonna vote for Brown just because i kind of like Brown and his attitude but when uh when it really comes down in the fall i think i know where its gonna go   yeah yeah i i think hes got a very good chance so theres a lot of people here pulling for him   umhum   so i dont know  well just see how did you uh  you work in the um computer business that what you said   yeah you know this yeah im an end user i teach people how to use Macintoshes and how to buy equipment and desktop publishing magazine production and things related to that   oh okay well my husband works for um Texas Instruments and so um thats how we found out about the Switchboard   uhhuh oh yeah oh thats their project too isnt it i found about it on the network
