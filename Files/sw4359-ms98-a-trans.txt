                are you there   i sure am   well i guess it sounds like you have children in the background there   yes i do   yeah what kind of child care have you found for them   uh were military so we take him to a military day care   uhhuh   um im enrolled in a school right now a nursing school and its just about the only thing i can afford   i see uhhuh it is expensive   it is and   what what kind uh through the military what kind of prices do you pay for child care there   forty five a week   forty five a week im from the Bay area and uh just not even um well known schools in child care here people are paying two hundred two hundred fifty a week   yes oh my goodness youre kidding   no i dont know how they do it im i stay at home im a mother i stay at home with mine but i know that its uh really expensive here   oh that is outrageous   what types of things have you looked for when youre um when you were looking in for to the child care there   well ive had several different kinds of day care   uhhuh   i had a friend taking care of him and that doesnt work   it doesnt   no um your your beliefs are different and i i guess they become you you cant um make demands that you can when youre paying for it   uhhuh i understand that   and im im not talking severe demands im talking things like i have to have you on Wednesday you know what i mean   uhhuh right   i have an exam i must have you baby sit   right   um ive had home health care that ive gotten through agencies and things like that   umhum yeah well have the agencies agencies sent you some good people or   uh no no theyre theyre usually badly educated   no huh uhhuh   um   probably poor English thats what you find here in the Bay area a lot of times   yes yes and im im just not willing to expose my child to that   uhhuh   i mean i i want him to be i want him to be stimulated and interested   yeah does does through the military does the day care do they have things like oh craft projects and learning numbers is it is it kind of like a a preschool it is   yes preschool only half a day half a day is kind of geared toward those kind of things   uhhuh   and every week is divided like this week theyre doing spring and then next week they may do kites and all week theyll have things about this   i see uhhuh   not only they talk about kites they talk about the different colors on kites they talk cultural aspects the shapes   umhum hm or   uh you know its wonderful   well it sounds like a good school you know im uh being at home with mine um if if i do go back to work it you know it worries me to death the thought of uh the child care you hear so many things about   it is frightening   oh kids being oh Shaken Child Syndrome being kids being molested i mean its its so hard to say say you know even with even with credentials whether you can trust them with your kids   it is Roberts day care has um close camera watch on the children you know what  i mean so its monitored   uhhuh oh thats good   plus they have um this is military so they have doctors come in and do checkups on the kids uh Texas   what state are you in oh Texas my   Fort Worth umhum   oh huh yeah   and and dentists come over child social work comes over uh family services comes over   uhhuh   i mean its a continual rotation of resources   oh well that sounds like a really good it sounds like a good place to to rear kids it sounds like youre in a good good situation with the military   it is and they dont change day care people at all i mean my son has been in there now a year and he has the same teacher   uhhuh see thats thats a problem with the day care here my sisterinlaw has everyone i know in the Bay area except me have their kids in day care and   and you know why they keep these people they pay them more   umhum exactly yeah the military i mean they just take care of their own i mean   they do   these mothers my my um sisterinlaws kids have been in day care and theyve switched i mean from one day care to another and those poor kids   oh i know they need they need um   they dont know whats going on consistence consistency   yes they need and they need this person is taking care of some of those things that i cant give my child   uhhuh   now im in school so im im home a lot   uhhuh   i mean hes not like one a eight to five job where im gone all the time   uhhuh   but he he these parent people are these women are mothering my child to a certain degree thats so important   umhum it is really important well youre so lucky you know that   i am   that you have such a good opportunity with um the through the military especially   very lucky i have to admit i dont know what id do without it   yeah my um i guess uh i was surprised to hear the prices of the day care here um   oh i know   being two two and im sure even in some of the nicer im not im talking uh San Jose area the nicer areas Paolo Alto more as it gets more expensive   oh no   you probably pay them i would assume you pay them more just because theyre overhead in the day you know their renting in these day care places   umhum   you know the overhead for the for uh you know just paying their rent in the buildings   my sister lives in Austin and she has the most wonderful home health care   oh does she   lady who does this for a living so she has six children thats all she can have by law   uhhuh   and
