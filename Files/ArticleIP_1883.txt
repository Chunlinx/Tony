                                 Defining Disaster Down            When they closed the weddingchapels brothels and even the hour casinos in Nevada early this month Iknew that disaster had truly struck Its a strange feeling to see the casinosdark said a Harrahs spokeswoman Sort of like when Winston Churchill noticedthe lights going out all over Europe            Untilthen I had been skeptical about media reports of natural disasters Earlierthat week Washingtons governor had declared an emergency in several parts ofhis state after it had been hit by a set of snowstorms this was before warmrain turned the snow into floodwater A Slate colleague in Redmond a Seattlesuburb and the home of Microsoft allowed that the roads were treacherous andthat a lot of people were without electricity But somehow it didnt feel likean emergency to a man who had grown up in the Midwest where they know fromblizzards Have we gotten soft he wondered            Well have we Having lowered our standards on whatconstitutes commonly acceptable behavior as Sen Daniel Patrick MoynihanDNY famously put ithave we also reduced the threshold for commonlyaccepted calamity Have we defined disaster down Only in this caseunlikein Moynihansthe redefinition has served to increase rather than decreasethe required level of government intervention shifting to the nationaltreasury responsibility for hardships that individuals and localities oncestoically assumed            Only anincorrigible cynic would suspect the victims of quakes tornadoes andwildfires of smiling at the thought of the fat government relief check thatwould enable them to pack up for sunnier climes or at least to replace thatcrummy old carpeting in the living room And yet the data do suggest thatsomething more than outrageous fortune is at work            Spending on disasters by the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency burgeoned to  billion over the last five years from billion over the previous five Billions more were spent collectively by some other federal agencies such as the Small Business Administration and thedepartments of Health and Human Services Housing and Urban DevelopmentAgriculture and the Interior Before  no snowstorm or blizzard had beendeclared a major disaster or emergency by the president though federal helphad been offered in a dozen or so other winter events in which additionaldamage such as the downing of utility lines had occurred Since  nearlyfour dozen severe winter storms have been so designated  in  alone Lastyear in fact was a banner year for calamity FEMA found itself responding to major disasters and eight emergencies so designated by the White House Theprevious record of  disasters and two emergencies was set in             Ofcourse both  and  were election years An unscientific mind notingthe tendency of relief aid to gravitate toward electorally rich states mighteven conclude that the gods of mayhem conspire with incumbents to providecalamitous occasions for the demonstration of political compassion After allCalifornia with  electoral votes received  percent of federal disasteraid from  to  and Florida with  votes garnered  percent            John Solomon who provides these last data in an article inthe October  Washington                Monthly  offers a less credulousexplanation Disaster relief is a unique example of political pork thateveryone accepts as kosher            Yes itspork but we are a wealthy country Why shouldnt we all pitch in and help eachother out when times are tough True Clintons appetite for greenbackedcompassion is keen In September  when Hurricane Fran upended DurhamNC the local HeraldSun agreed to distribute a FEMA advice bookletonly to discoveraccording to the papers editorthat the booklet was held upfor five crucial days so that it could be reworked to feature pictures of andmessages from the president and Democratic Gov Jim Hunt Still its abipartisan taste and when both parties dig in the banquet never ends            More than two years after the  NorthridgeCalif earthquake for example HUD found itself still paying generous rentsubsidies to more than half of the  displaced lowerincome residents whohad been granted temporary aid after the disaster Many according to aFebruary  story in the Los                Angeles                Times  had beenmoved to housing far superior to their disasterdamaged homes Last May theRepublicancontrolled Congress voted to make the subsidies permanent            Nor doesit seem fair to blame the bureaucrats FEMA got nothing but brickbats for itsslow and stumbling performance in the aftermath of s Hurricane AndrewWhen under Clinton appointee James Lee Witt the agency finally earned ravenotices for its response to the Great Flood of  only the dullestfunctionary could have missed the lesson When you do battle with disaster nomedals are awarded for being stingy            Not surprisingly examples abound of disasteraid abusesand misuses over the last few years James Bovard provides a useful compendiumin the September  American                Spectator  drawing on the periodiccritiques prepared by FEMAs own inspector general and the General AccountingOffice            Yet itsalso noteworthy that the bulk of the recommendations put forth by GAO came fromFEMA regional officials themselves These include ideas such as limiting theappeals that states and individuals can file if the feds decline to pick uprestoration costswhile these appeals are pending FEMA has to pick up thefull costs of relocating not only families but also such expensive entities ascity halls and universities Another idea Eliminating help includingexpensive relandscaping now provided to golf courses marinas and otherrevenuegenerating enterprises that can well afford their own insurance            Nor does the agency harbor any illusions aboutthe moral hazards engendered by its fight against the hazards of nature FEMAofficials could be heard last week bemoaning the fact that people just keepmoving back into the flood plains from which only a few years earlier they hadbeen rescued even as developers destroy more of the watershed that offeredsome natural protection Among the Frequently Asked Questions FEMA posts onits Web site is the following I think that some people in my neighborhood aretrying to cheat the federal government out of disaster money They dont seemto have the damage they claim they have and theyre bragging about it Who canI report disaster fraud to            But rulebending by individuals is probably penny ante stuff compared with the advantagetaken by states and their agencies upon whom FEMAs tiny audit staff must relyto verify all but the largest grants California officials have been especiallyaggressive muscling reluctant FEMA officials to expend billions on codeupgrades requiring massive or even total reconstruction of buildings sufferingrelatively minor damage One FEMA inspector told GAO that some surveydamagereports after the Northridge quake included work that had been specificallyrejected after the Loma Prieta quake five years earlier            Local governments quickly learn bad lessons too If theyare foolish enough to set aside reserves to cover their own cleanup costs afterstorms and floods they get no help at all On the other hand if havinggotten a FEMA loan to cover most of their emergency bills they somehow fail toraise enough revenues to cover all their regular spending plus the payback costthree years later FEMA will forgive the debt It may not surprise you to learnthat few loans are repaid GAO offers examples of localities banking extra FEMAmoney and collecting interest on it And now an imaginative but severelycrimeridden neighborhood in Minneapolis is threatening to ask PresidentClinton to declare their district a federal disaster area on the grounds thatstate and local authorities cant or wont cope with their longrunningproblems            In responding to GAOsrecommendations for reform FEMA Director Witt noted that however well takenthey like previous reforms were likely to be rejected by Congress becausethey would seriously affect benefits to the states and their citizens Nowyou know why the federal deficit is so big            Witt wants to devote hisefforts to mitigation instead to helping localities prepare better for thenext disaster Handing out a new kind of grant has after all a great dealmore political appeal than trying to crack down on the old kind But itsworth remembering when the next set of calamities hits your televisionscreenor far worse your own communitythat when we decide to nationalizeour problems the overhead tends to get very high very fast And some of thelargest costs are paid in the corrosion of those personal and communitystandards that we claim to value most
