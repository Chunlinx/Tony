                                 A Bum Situation                           Please send your questions for publication to prudenceslatecom                                                         DearPrudence                                                      I hope you will take a look at my situationFour years ago I took in my younger brother then  years old who was down onhis luck I was divorced and raising two small children and it really was niceto have the adult contact I remarried a year later but my brother doesntseem to want to leave                                       He has never had aplace of his ownalways staying with friends or relatives He finally got aparttime job but theres no way he could afford to live on his own He paysme  a week room and board which of course doesnt begin to cover hisexpenses The worst part is that he has borrowed many things from my home andsold them for money We have had so many discussions about this that now hejust hides in my den his bedroom and I hardly ever see him My husband triesto stay out of the line of fire and is no help at all My friends tell me I aman enabler and that I should put him out but I cant I am his only family inthe state and am so afraid that if I do someday a policeman will knock on mydoor to tell me that they found my brother frozen to death in some paper boxunder a bridge I know that Im not doing him a service letting him stay butwhat am I to do                                       Caring Sibling                        Dear Care            What a lovely sister you are Now you must be astrong friend He has no life living in your den and hocking your belongingsFor your sake and his he has got to go Do not look at it as putting himout but rather steering him to an independent life It sounds like theres anunderlying emotional problem in his way Get him in touch with a local mentalhealth service For example he may be clinically depressed in which casemedication might jumpstart a new and motivated life Family Service Americaprovides lowcost or free therapy and job training Ask advice about arranginghousingmaybe a group situation allied with a service group perhaps someplacesuch as YMCA            Painful as it may betough love is whats called for If you can afford it give him a stipend for aspecified period of time as a tangible sign of your helping hand That wouldalso lessen any guilt you might have Four years is a long time to provide acrash pad for anyone If you dont do something soon you may lose your husbandand still have your brother hiding in the den Much luck to you            Prudie positively                                             DearPrudie                                                      I have always wantedthis woman who was recently widowed How can I approach her without seeminglike a vulture Should I like Jerry and Elaine make it clear that I am therefor her                                       Mr V                        Dear Mr            The Seinfeld approach would be fine Kindness isnever confused with being predatory assuming you are already friends Prudiewould suggest you not ask the recently bereaved widow to a dancing party asyour opening salvo instead an invitation to Sunday brunch and a stroll wouldstrike the right casual note You wont of course confess youve always had ayen for her Got that            Small caveat Since youdo not say just when the deceased shuffled off this mortal coil check withmutual friends to see just how griefstricken she is If shes in terribleshape give her some time before you ask her out In fact a phone call to askhow shes doing would be a good precursor to any invitation            Prudie sensitively                                             DearPrudence                                                      I have been datingthis man for the past year and a half I left my husband for him which I nowknow was a huge mistake The man is still married but he tells me that hedoesnt love his wife He says he loves me and promises that eventually we willbe together I know being with him is wrong however I cant not see him Irealize the best thing to do is forget about him but how do I dothat                                       Hopeless                         Dear Hope            If Prudie had a nickel for every married man whoswore he didnt love his wife and that eventually he and the girlfriendwould be together her fortune would rival that of Bill Gates Borrowedhusbands are bad newseven when they leave her and marry you Guys who cheat have a screw loose forgive the unfortunate metaphor            How do you forget him You review the situation andtote up a big list of every negative thing you can think of  starting withthe fact that you left your husband and your inamorato did zip Youre the dishon the side period As a mechanistic approach start acting like youreavailable spend time with the girls get active in hobbies or groups dothings where single people meet each other Prudie hears that the Habitat forHumanity projects for example are quite a good venue            Now repeat after PrudieBorrowed husbands are bad news And if the  in your signature refers to yourage thats the prime time to attract suitable men And even if it refers toyour waist get cracking            Prudie wisely                                             DearPrudence                                                      I was recently askedby a good friend to be his best man While deeply honored this occasionpresents me with great difficulty You see I am gay Though it may not beapparent to everyone my close friends are fully aware of my persuasionHaving said that my big problem centers on the traditional stag party thatthe best man is asked to host Since the groom has both straight and gay malefriends how does a gay best man host a stag party that will be fun for myfriend as well as those in attendance Should his gay friends not be invitedThanks in advance for your advice Prudie                                       Best Man                        Dear Best            Prudie has a hunch thatgirls jumping out of cakes would amuse anyone  if they still do that kind ofthing Actually Prudie doesnt know what goes on at stag parties Which is whyshe suggests you enlist a straight friend of the groom to help you plan theparty That way you will come up with an evening enjoyable for bothheterosexual men and natures bachelors Keeping a group of mengay andstraightamused for a few hours should not be all that difficult And what thehonoree will remember best is that all his buddies were there            Prudie festively
