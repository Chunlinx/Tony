                    Background        Chemokines are a large superfamily of small        structurallyrelated peptides originally discovered as        neutrophil attractants Interleukin IL is a potent        member of the supergene family of CXC chemokines with ELR        motif ELR ELR CXC chemokines are potent angiogenic        factors whereas ELR CXC chemokines are potent angiostatic        factors Studies have shown that these angiogenesisrelated        activities are correlated with tumorigenesis in many tumor        types and are distinct from their ability to recruit        neutrophils             Interleukin IL is inducible in a wide range of        cells including lymphocytes monocytes endothelial cells        fibroblasts hepatocytes and keratinocytes              IL is also found to be constitutively expressed in        several tumor tissues including bronchogenic carcinoma        nonsmall cell lung cancer colorectal carcinoma breast        cancer melanoma prostate cancer gastric carcinoma and        ovarian cancer While IL has been implicated in        growthpotentiation     angiogenesis     metastasis             and tumorigenesis     of various tumors its        specific role remains unclear Several observations support        the assertion that a complex interaction between IL and        several other growth factors cytokines or other proteins        is responsible for these tumorrelated events                 Growth regulated protein alpha GRO beta        GRO and ENA have been reported to be coinduced        with IL in A cells stimulated with two proinflammatory        cytokines IL and TNF     This result is        consistent with the presence of nuclear factor kappa B        NFB consensus binding sites in the promoter regions of        all three genes      In addition GRO and  are        also members of the ELR CXC cytokine family that are        reported to be important mediators of tumorigenesis through        their angiogenic properties      They both share one        of the IL receptors CXCR which has been postulated to        regulate the ELR CXC chemokinemediated angiogenesis and        resultingtumorigenesis     These observations suggest        that GRO and  may exhibit expression profiles similar        to IL Coordinated expression of these and other factors        with IL in certain tumor tissues suggests that they may        be functionally associated with IL in these tumors In        order to fully understand ILs role in these events it        is important to investigate these coordinately expressed        genes A systematic unbiased approach to identification        and ranking of proteins related to ILs expression in        tumor tissuescells may help to define the scope of ILs        role in tumorigenicity and important related interactions        with other factors        There are over  million human Expressed Sequence Tag        EST records in GenBank Table  which is still growing        rapidly EST sequences in GenBank are derived from cDNA        libraries generated from a vast array of tissue types        including normal diseasestate and variously treated        tissues The number of EST clones is reported to be        proportional to the abundance of cognate transcripts in the        tissue or cell type used to make the cDNA library and thus        the EST distribution can provide a quantitative assessment        of differential expression of a gene     The expanding        tissue diversity and EST coverage have increased the        statistical power of ESTdistribution based expression        analysis An approach using EST expression data as a binary        variable present or absent in a cDNA library has        previously identified prostate cancerassociated genes            We are reporting here a novel         in silico approach for identification        of genes whose mRNA are enriched in libraries where IL is        represented We focused on ESTs from cDNA libraries in        which IL has been sequenced at least once and analyzed        the EST frequency of occurrence for all other genes in        these IL related cDNA libraries Those cDNA libraries        were further catalogued into tumor and nontumor libraries        which allowed us to identify genes whose expression profile        is closely related to that of IL in tumor tissues        Additional File         IL cDNA Libraries List of all cDNA libraries in which        IL has been sequenced at least once        Click here for

 cDNA libraries referred to as IL tissue we generated          a reference database for all the genes and their          expression profile relationship measure by Zscore with          IL The complete list of genes is provided in          additional file  along with a distribution table based          on contig size and Zscore Table  A gene could be          represented by multiple contigs which represent splice          variants and sequencing errors In this database we          provide the statistics for each contig including the          number of EST clones cDNA libraries EST clones in IL          tissue and cDNA libraries in IL tissue First we          evaluated the performance of this search using the          distribution analysis results for some known genes Table           The coexpression of IL with IL GRO and GRO          in many tissues has been well documented                and those genes are identified here as IL related genes          with an IL Zscore   The GRO and ENA             also show a high IL Zscore although the available EST          clone number for these two genes is much smaller          Successful identification of these genes demonstrates the          value of our           in silico approach Besides          Zscore this database can be sorted in many different          ways For example we can adjust the stringency of          correlation by using the number of IL cDNA libraries as          a cutoff parameter          Additional File           Contigs identified in IL tissue List of contigs that          have at least one EST in IL tissue

        The significance of this study lies in the generation          of a complete reference database for IL coexpressed          genes We present here a list of  genes with high EST          clone

expression profile the percentage of          ILtumor clones versus IL clones R           tumor  was calculated for the  IL          genes The resulting graph is shown in Figure  The R           tumor

        Genes coexpressed with IL in tumor tissues or          cell lines          A set of tumor cDNA libraries in which IL is          expressed a subset of the IL tissue cDNA libraries          was generated and is referred to as ILtumor tissue          This virtual tissue consists of  cDNA libraries           cDNA clones Table and Additional file  An          ILtumor gene database was established based on these          libraries The complete list of genes is provided in          additional file  along with a distribution table based          on contig size and Zscore Table  We present here           candidate genes with relatively high levels of expression          in ILtumor tissue EST clone count   and          ILtumor Zscore   referred to as ILtumor          genes IT IT  IT Table  To determine          whether these genes are specifically related to          ILtumor tissue or whether they are also commonly found          in tumors lacking IL expression the ratio between          ILtumor clones and general tumor clones R           iltumor  was plotted for ILtumor          genes Figure  The R           iltumor for all IL tumor genes are          greater than  which is much higher than the expected          background ratio between ILtumor clones  Table           and general tumor clones  Table  A few of          these genes are highly specific to ILtumor tissues          Most notably GW  PS and KLF show R           iltumor values of   and           respectively                            Discussion        The vast amount of available EST data allows expression        analysis based solely on computational methods It is        possible to construct a virtual tissue based on the        expression pattern of a particular gene or group of genes        eg tumor marker genes It is also possible to group        genes by tissue type through combining genes from the same        source tissue eg tumor brain etc In this study we        have generated virtual tissues based on a expression of        IL in all tissues and b expression of IL in tumor        tissues Next we generated lists of genes that are most        highly coexpressed with IL in these two virtual tissues        Since the method is not limited to genes previously        correlated with IL expression nor to known genes we have        the opportunity to identify previously overlooked        correlations with known or novel genes In addition the        relative strength of the correlations is measured by a        Zscore based on the number of clones representing IL or        ILtumor tissue compared with the total number of clones        Assuming that coexpression is related to function these        Zscores provide a basis for ranking genes according to        potential involvement in ILs function This reference        database for genes coexpressed with IL can be        crossreferenced with other large scale expression        analyses such as microarray experiments to help decipher        the regulation network and the functions of IL and IL        coexpressed genes        Among the genes most highly correlated with IL in        tumor tissues are KLF PS VEGF and tumor necrosis        factor receptor TNFR lumican keratin sulfate        proteoglycan claudin and perlecan Cytokines IL and        IL induce the expression of KLF in activated T cells        which correlates with their survival     They suggest        that KLF may be involved in avoiding activationinduced        cell death It is possible that IL may also mediate        similar actions This type of action could increase the        ability of tumor cells to survive under conditions where        cells normally apoptose        Lumican expression has previously been correlated with        higher tumor grade lower estrogen levels in the tumor and        younger age of patients in human breast cancer     In        addition lumican is structurally related to both biglycan        which is among the top ILtumor related genes and the        human embryonal carcinoma marker antigen TRA            These relationships support the hypothesis that lumican may        be a tumor related protein involved with ILs tumorigenic        function        PS was also found to be highly correlated with IL in        both the entire list of tissues and specifically in tumor        tissues Based on EST distribution presenilin  PS is        less related to ILtumor libraries Zscore          ILtumor cloneTotal Clone   In the breast tumor        microarray experiments unlike PS the peak level of        expression for PS is not in BT PS is a gene involved        in earlyonset familial Alzheimers disease There is        accumulating evidence that mutations in PS accelerate        neurodegeneration and facilitate apoptosis and some        researchers    suggest an association with the p        signal transduction pathway It was suggested that        downregulation of PS by wildtype p and also p        WAFmay be independent mechanisms leading to apoptosis and        tumor suppression     Our data correlating PS with        ILtumor related tissue also suggest a potential        antiapoptotic role for PS in tumorigenesis        Vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF like IL is        a potent mediator of angiogenesis VEGF has been shown to        regulate angiogenesis and metastasis of bladder cancer           and several recent studies have reported correlations        with IL in several cell types including bladder cancer        TCC nonsmall cell lung cancer NSCLC      human        brain microvascular endothelial cells HBMECS    and        monocytes     These data collectively demonstrate the        correlation of VEGF with IL in tumor tissues        TNF is a wellcharacterized potent inducer of IL        transcription and an antiapoptotic agent              Roebuck provides a detailed analysis of IL promoter        structure including a promoter recruitment mechanism which        involves TNF and the cooperativity of NFkB and NFIL        binding sites      TNF exerts many of its effects        through TNFR and TNFR receptors thus coexpression of        these receptors with IL might be anticipated Our        analysis does reveal a correlation between TNFR and IL        expression Using another bioinformatic approach Eidelman        et al report a close relationship between IL secretion        in cystic fibrosis cells and expression of genes from the        TNFRNFkB pathway As is the case for several other genes        found in this study the TNFRNFkB pathway is associated        with pp WAFtumor suppressor systems                       Our analysis identified several interesting genes        coexpressed with IL in tumor tissues which have not        previously been associated with IL Along with lumican        claudin KLF PS VEGF and TNFR mentioned above        these include several secreted proteins secreted apoptosis        related protein  and NPDC which are also likely to        function in coordination with IL several genes from the        wellknown family of complement factors C esterase human        complement CA and complement factor B and several        unknown or hypothetical genes Interestingly several of        the genes correlate with the pp WAFtumor suppressor        network We expect that some of these genes may present        important therapeutic targets at one or more levels in the        network of IL mediated interactions related to        tumorigenesis        Like all ESTbased expression analysis there are        limitations for this         in silico method First ESTbased        expression analysis is not suitable for transcripts with        low abundance no or few representative ESTs in the        database which precludes statistical analysis Second        ESTbased expression analysis can only indicate the        coexpression of genes but can not accurately measure the        expression level Third to generate a comprehensive        reference database we decided not to exclude cDNA        libraries based on the sequence depth or special        manipulation eg subtraction and normalization The        depth of sequencing and special manipulation are not        consistent across cDNA libraries which could also        influence the sensitivity of the analysis        The computational expression analysis methods developed        here are not limited to the identification of IL related        genes but can also be applied to many other proteins of        interest This method is complementary to other largescale        expression analysis methods eg microarray in that it is        not limited by the physical presence of a gene on        microarray thus it offers an unique approach to        discovering potential functional links between genes        through expression profiling                    Methods                  In silicoexpression analysis          All noncommercial software used in these studies was          written in PERL  Human EST sequence and cDNA library          information were retrieved from GenBank Release  and          an inhouse relational database model Sybase SQL Server          Release  CA Sybase Inc was created to mirror the          public human EST database dbEST The EST sequences were          first binned into clusters if they share the same  mer          tag beginning with ATG or CTG Next ESTs in each cluster          were assembled into contigs using the PHRAP sequence          assembly software Phil Green Unpublished Based on the          ESTs corresponding to IL in its cognate contig we          generated a set of cDNA libraries in which IL is          represented This set of libraries is referred to as IL          tissue and can be considered as a virtual tissue          consisting of  cDNA libraries  cDNA clones          Table and Additional file  We chose contigs          consisting of at least  EST clones and present in at          least  IL libraries The frequency of occurrence            F  and Zscore for all the contigs          in these cDNA libraries were calculated as                              where           N           IL is the number of EST clones in          IL tissue for a particular contig           N           total is the total EST clone count in          that contig Contigs were collected into groups based on          contig size number of EST clones in a contig and small          contig groups   contigs were merged together          with neighboring groups similar in contig size to make          sure that there were at least  contigs in each group          The rational for grouping contigs based on size is that          the distribution pattern of           F ie mean and Zscore may vary          for contigs of different size           n is the total number of contigs in          a contig group            F is the sum of           F in a contig group and           SDV is the standard deviation of           F in a contig group Assuming a          Gaussian Distribution the fractions of the population          that are greater than Zscore           SDV and also above the mean are            and  for Zscores of   and           respectively Similarly a set of tumor cDNA libraries          based on their GenBank Annotations in which IL is          represented was generated This set of libraries is          referred to as ILtumor tissue consisting of  cDNA          libraries  cDNA clones Table and Additional          file  Using the method described above a database for          ILtumor candidate genes using ILtumor tissue was          generated and ILtumor Zscores were calculated          Databases for GRO and GRO related genes were          generated in a similar way using the cDNA libraries where          GRO or GRO were represented respectively Table                                      Authors contributions
