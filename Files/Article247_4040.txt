                                 Split Screens and Texas Screeds            The Los Angeles Times  the Washington Post  and the New York Times all lead withCongress approval of the fiercely contended spending bill The  vote infavor was the last piece of the  trillion federal budget for  and itallowed senators to adjourn for the year All three papers report that althoughboth parties had to make significant compromises to pass the bill bothDemocrats and Republicans are touting their local victories within the billPresident Clintons plan to hire more teachers will receive its requisitefunding and the Republicans are assured of more money for medicalresearch            The LAT highlights the Republican claim that passage of the billcould mean that the Social Security trust fund will remain untouched for thefirst time in  years an assertion that the NYT treats with deepskepticism In addressing the individual parts of the spending package theNYT points out that the budget still exceeds the set spending limits forthis year by  million Whereas the LAT and the NYT address theprovisions of the bill in terms of the dollar amount assigned to them theWP tends to foreground the legislators who backed or opposed particularprovisions The WP account also includes more of the behindthesceneswheeling and dealing that took place in the final hours The second paragraphof the WP piece examines a regionally motivated disagreement over dairysubsidies that very nearly incited a lastminute allnight filibuster TheLAT and the NYT both include the threatened filibuster but lessprominently A sense of grateful relief that the filibuster never materializedand that the budget was finally sent to the president pervades all threepapersthey seem to be as glad to be done writing about it as the senators areto be done haggling over it The NYT reports that after the agreementwas reached members of both parties emptied silently out of the chamber            The WP offleads and the NYT fronts federal judge ThomasPenfield Jacksons appointment of Judge Richard Posner to act as nonbindingmediator in the Justice Departments suit against Microsoft Both sideswelcomed the appointment The NYT centers its coverage on the presentstatus of the suit and whether a mediator can help bring about a settlementThe WP goes with a close scrutiny of Posners record as a conservativejurist skeptical of governmentregulated business A WP companion piecethough warns that its impossible to pigeonhole Posners views andproclivities and that neither side in the case should feel as though its beenappointed an ally            The NYT offleads the European security summit in Turkey where newlimits on conventional armaments and simplifications of the procedures fortheir inspection were adopted The Russian war against Chechnya stood in starkcontrast to the goals of the security talks but Russia said that despite themass of criticism it was receiving in Turkey its conduct toward Chechnya wouldremain unchanged The LAT goes with a local offlead that couldeventually have national significance a federal appeals court ruled in SanFrancisco that state and local governments cannot ban outdoor tobaccoadvertising But such bans have been upheld in other regions of the countryThe matter will likely go to the Supreme Court            The WP fronts the protests that met President Clinton upon hisarrival in Athens Many Greeks expressed their lasting outrage at the USledbombing of Yugoslavia The story is slugged Thousands Protest Visit USPolicy President Shielded from Violence and the article develops more fullythat juxtaposition between the fury in the streets and the tranquility in whichthe president was able to conduct his visit In its live coverage of the daysevents Greek television split the screen between Clintons speech at theairport and images of marauding protesters hurling rocks and firebombsMimicking that splitscreen strategy the WP places the article inwhich Clinton is quoted to say that If people want to protest they ought tohave a chance to do it under a threecolumn photo of riot police confrontingangry demonstrators in front of stores they had set on fire Reefering thestory the LAT also contrasts the violence of the protests with theplacidity Clinton enjoyed while in the country And the LAT also offersmore specific details of the protests  demonstrators assembled injured and  detained by police            All three papers front Gov Bushs speech in which he outlined his foreignpolicy agenda in short a new American internationalism He would treat Chinaas a competitor not a partner and he wouldnt allow Russian brutality inChechnya to go unpunished All three papers assert that Bush made the gettoughspeech to answer critics of his foreign policy abilities but each paper drawsdifferent conclusions about the speechs effectiveness The WP heads itsstory with Bush Urges Engagement Opposes Test Ban Treaty suggesting acertain reckless bluster The NYT hints that it was merely awellrehearsed setpiece that will crumble when Bush debuts it live at theupcoming debates with his Republican opponents The LAT stands alone inreporting that the speech received endorsements from some prominentRepublicans such as Sen Richard Lugar            EgyptAir Flight  receives less and less front page space every day Itdoesnt make the front of the NYT  and the WP relegates it to areefer on the safety board chairmans statement that media leaks have cloudedinvestigations into the disaster
