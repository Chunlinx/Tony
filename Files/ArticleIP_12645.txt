                                 Do as I Say Not as I Do            By way of introducing oursubjectproviding for the material needs of a babya caveat Whatever it isyou dont need it            In other words do as Isay not as Ive done It is permissible I believe to shop like a mad dog foryour first child and when Daughter No  arrived nearly two years ago I didBut when my auxiliary daughter appeared on the scene last month I learned notone lesson from the mistakes of previous rampages            A sort of shopping psychosis overtakes the mind of a fatherfresh from the delivery room It might be rooted in some sort of primalhuntergatherertype urge the kind that afflicts most men when they enter aPrice Club Of course we need  gallons of WD honey You never know whentheyre going to stop making it Conquer this urge and you may graduate thefirst month of parenthood without fielding a call from an American Expresssecurity officer worried about unusual activity on your card            Here then a quick guideto what you need and what you dont This is obviously a subjective guidewritten by the kind of flawed individual who actually considered buying anelectric baby wipe warmer It is also the briefest of guideseach subcategoryof baby products is worthy of booklength discussion Finally it isutilitarian If you are the sort of person who must have a Kate Spade diaperbag knowing full well that a Kate Spade diaper bag is a waste of  I canthelp you            D iapers Diaper bags are a good place tostart since they are unnecessary A  knapsack and a  drydownanabsorbent washable padare perfectly sufficient substitutes Diapers arehowever necessary and I would suggest as a first step the purchase of PriceClub diapers which come in huge cartons and cost about  percent less thanthe equivalent number of Pampers Warehouse club diapers arent as handsome orsturdylooking as premium or supreme diapers but even standard diaperstoday can absorb the contents of a camels hump without leaking Avoidpremium diapers that contain emollients or aloe vera which dont transfer tothe babys skin The only diaper worth paying a premium price for is one thatchanges itself            There is no downside this pun was genuinelyunintended to Price Club baby wipes whose very inferiority make them a betterproduct Most premium brandsHuggies Pampers and the likeare soaked to anabsurd degree with whatever strange chemical cleansers all wipes are soaked inPrice Club wipes however are packaged with more modest amounts of cleansingliquid presumably to save the manufacturer money Which is fine because wipesthat are too wet must then be followed up with several drycloth swipes whichcan irritate the skin As for electric baby wipe warmers one of which in mylocal highend baby superstore Buy Buy Baby awful names are a hazard of thistrade sold for  I have this to say As much as I want my children to besheltered from the cruelties of life on earth I think they should get used tothe fact that sometimes their asses will get cold            One more note as weleave the diaper department An indispensable purchase is a Diaper Genie abrilliant little contraption that is a vast improvement over the open diaperpail A Diaper Genie which generally sells for around  accepts dirtydiapers through a hole on top and with a few twists of a canister seals thediapers in plastic and eliminates most of the smell It does not provide Level biohazard containmentignore the optimistic odorfree claim made on theboxbut it will do in most cases            C lothing Even if you are only moderatelypopular and come from a modestly sized family you will receive on the birthof your first child at least  worth of Baby Gap clothing Which meansthat a gift of Gap stock rather than Gap clothing should be far morewelcome There are those who decry the style hegemony of Baby Gap but I amnot one of them The clothing is relatively inexpensive durable andreturnable The point is this There are plenty of places to dump  on apair of awfully cute baby overalls that will be worn exactly three times but baby overalls like subzero freezers and Land Rovers are a sign that youhave too much money                           Car safety On issues of childsafety I take the SDI position which is to say there is no such thing as toomuch defense spending Hence the Ford Explorer parked outside which I wouldupgrade to an Expedition except that I live in a neighborhood filled withNaderite public interest lawyers who would firebomb my house if I droveanything so offensive            Two tons of metal are notenough to defend your children however A maximalist position on safety meansonly one car seat will do the Britax It is more expensive than therunofthemill Century line of car seats a Britax runs above  but it ismade of material so hard it would crack your knee if you walked into it andits belting system is far more encompassing and elaborate than the average carseats            H ome safety Every baby superstorefeatures a section that could be called the Wall of Death At Buy Buy Baby thesuburban Washington store with which Im most familiar the Wall of Death rises feet into the air and stretches  feet wide and every inch of the wall iscovered with child safety products some of which are absolutely useless andmost of which I have bought I havent got around to installing the toilet lidlocks yet Obviously outlet guards and rubber padding for low furniture theCoffee Tables of Death with which most parents are familiar are necessarybut the Wall of Death preys on parental fear Hence a product calledfireplace gas valve safety covers whose purpose was too obscure for me tounderstand and the VCR Lock which according to the packaging preventschild from inserting objects into cassette opening Another way to prevent adeadly epidemic of object insertions is to move the VCR Incidentally the bestway to keep a child from drowning in the toilet is to keep an eye on the childor the toiletexcessive reliance on safety products tends toward lowervigilance            Then there are the baby monitors arguably anecessity if you live in a big house and cant hear the baby crying in herroomand also a necessity if youre interested in intercepting policetransmissionsbut is the Child View Monitor and Television for really necessary You cant even use it to spy on a nanny since it has nohidden camera capabilities                           Breast               pumps Ask someone else            C ribs You can spend  or  on acrib or you can spend  Spend  All cribs do the same thing which isstand there All cribs sold in reputable stores meet current safety standardsso no worries in that regard                           ShoesPayless ShoeSource or the equivalent is the way to go Actually barefoot isthe way to go but in those places where a small child should wear shoessuchas needlestrewn playgroundsit is a waste of money to spend more than on a pair of shoes We bought Daughter No  three pairs of  shoes whichshe outgrew in a month and wore so rarely in that month that amortized theshoes cost  per wearing money that could have been better spent onfireplace gas valve safety covers            T oys An endless subject one that Imhesitant to tackle and my children arent old enough for me to comment onFurby with any authority One general observation though The wrapping paperis always more interesting to a baby than whatevers inside so my giftsuggestion would be a cardboard box wrapped in bright red paper and filled withTupperware and wooden spoons That is if you can stand the noise produced bywooden spoons hitting Tupperware            The general subject of toys is a sensitive one inmy house because it is on toys that I am a serial spender An example Fourdays after my second daughter was born I was dispatched to Buy Buy Baby tofind some sort of bassinet accouterment worth about  I returned home twohours later with  worth of toys including a stuffed mounted furry rhinohead that cost  At the time I somehow believed that my daughters wouldgrow up healthy and secure if they just had a stuffed mounted rhino head intheir room I dont know why I believed this            The rhino head has since been returned and I ambanned from toy stores until such time as I regain my bearings It was afoolish purchase I see nowfor  I could have bought three electricbaby wipe warmers Or onethird of a Kate Spade diaper bag
