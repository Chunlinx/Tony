                                 Round Two ABC News  Metabolife             Chatterbox completely forgotto watch  Friday night Hed been meaning towatch it or to tape it so he could compare Arnold Diazs report on the herbaldiet supplement Metabolife to the full transcript of Diazs interview withMetabolife chief Mike Elliswhich Metabolife had mischievously posted alongwith a streaming video of the interview on a special kiss my butt ABC NewsWebsite See Metabolife Read This No Wait Dont Read ThisMetabolifes Lawyer Assures Cbox He Wont Sue andRound One ABC News  Metabolife  But when thehour arrived Chatterbox having spent a pleasant evening round the hearthwith Pappy and Mammy Chatterboxwho werevisiting from Californiawas preoccupied along with Mrs Chatterbox by thesomewhat arduous task of tucking the Chatterkinder snugly into their beds Thepotential dangers of diet pills and the potential irresponsibility of any TVnews coverage of same slipped entirely from Chatterboxs mind            Fortunately in this age of cyberjournalism everythingis retrievable ABC News was kind enough not only to email Chatterbox atranscript of the broadcast but also to post the transcript along with a streaming video of the segment on the Web site so that people who dont work forthe press can retrieve it too            Having now both watched andread Diazs report Chatterbox pronounces it quite fair It begins with a favorable testimonialfrom one Monica Skeens who says she lost  pounds by taking MetabolifeAdmittedly the testimonials credibility is undermined somewhat by Skeensprincessy claim that she isnt willing to exercise and is physically incapableof dieting On the other hand Skeens is precisely the sort of personMetabolife markets its product to This is followed by an unfavorable review from Julie CunninghamPotier who claims thatMetabolife caused her to suffer two seizures and slip into a coma she is nowsuing the company CunninghamPotiers claim is followed by Metabolifes Ellissaying on camera Theres nothing in the medical records that indicate thather condition was caused by Metabolife            Diaz then says that conducted a fourmonth investigation TV reporters like to brag about howlong they spend on a story a statistic that by itself means nothing and wassurprised at what we found surprised is a TVnews euphemism forappalled Diaz hits Metabolife for saying that its product was determined bytwo universities to be safe Not true says Dr Harry Gwirtsman of Vanderbiltand Dr Steven Heymsfield of St Lukes Roosevelt hospital who helped conductthe tests Gwirtsman says the study he worked on involved patients who tookMetabolife for one day  Heymsfield says Theseproducts may be safe in some people but not all people and that side effectssuch as heart palpitations and sleeplessness may be harbingers of potentiallymore dangerous side effects such as increases in blood pressure and pulsethat in turn may led to problems like heart attack and stroke            At this point Diaz says Metabolife claims Gwirtsman andHeymsfield werent principal researchers in thestudies but Diaz goes on to say that their participation was confirmed byVanderbilt and St Lukes Chatterbox never really thought they were making itup and that both institutions requested that Metabolife stop using theirstudies to claim the product is safe Diaz saves for later in the segmentMetabolifes other significant counterattack that Heymsfield is a trustee ofthe SlimFast Nutrition Institute and that SlimFast is a Metabolifecompetitor Diaz counters that with a quotation froma letter Heymsfield wrote to St Lukes general counsel that denies any biasnot that anyone would expect him to admit any and asserts that Metabolife istrying to suppress information regarding a potentially unsafe productIncidentally Chatterbox should confess here that in an earlier item he said Ellis told Diaz that some of thescientists Diaz cited had economic ties to Metabolife competitors on closerinspection of the raw transcript Chatterbox now realizes that Ellis made thataccusation only about Heymsfield  Metabolifesrepetition of the reference to Heymsfields SlimFast link in notesinterspersed throughout the manuscript tricked Chatterbox into thinkingmistakenly that there was more than one Metabolife critic who was receivingpayment from a Metabolife rival            Diaz then juxtaposes Ellis assertion that a certainhealth claim for Metabolife is not on the Metabolife WebWeb page withEllis subsequent embarrassed admission when presented with contrary evidencethat I dont know my company Web site  I havent even looked at itChatterbox would have preferred Diaz to use this marginally more embarrassingEllis quote spotted in the unedited interview transcript You know to behonestly fair with you I do not know what our Web site looks like            Diaz then trots off to interview Yales Dr RobertStark whom Metabolife insisted we interview Stark says that Metabolife issafe asas any other herbor dietary product but that larger studies areneeded to prove its safety Diaz also gets Stark to say that Metabolifeslabeling could be misleading because it downplays the fact that its beentested on lab animals not humans Remember Diaz gloats who can blamehim hes the doctor Metabolife referred us to            Diaz then says that the Food and Drug Administrationwants to impose strict limits on the daily dosage of ephedrine the keyingredient in Metabolife though he concedes as Ellis prodded him to do in theunedited interview transcript that another government agency he means theGovernment Accounting Office has criticized the FDAs scientific findings            Diaz saves the nastiest part for nexttolast Whatdo we know about the man behind Metabolife Ellis is a former police officerand real estate agent this last strikes Chatterbox as a cheap shot who itturns out is also a convicted felon Diaz says that Ellis was arrested in in what the Drug Enforcement Administration called the largestmethamphetamine bust in history an interesting statistic that Diaz failed todrop in his interview with Ellis and that Ellis pleaded guilty to a reducedcharge using a telephone to facilitate a drug trafficking offense And gotfive years probation            Oddly this part of the segment isnt quite as damaging to Ellis as the raw interview transcript wasDiaz points out that ephedrine is also a main ingredient in Metabolifethough he duly notes Ellis claim that this is mere coincidence he failshowever to repeat Ellis assertion apparently backed up by DEA andFDAcertified labs that you cant actually makemethamphetamine out of Metabolife Diaz does notquote at full embarrassing length Ellis explanation that he got mixed upwith the wrong folk because one of them was like a brother to me Diaz alsodoesnt say as he said in the raw interview transcript that the lesseroffense Ellis pleaded guilty to was a felony Andthis is Ellis biggest breakin the  segmentDiaz doesnt quote Ellisastonishing admission that until about a year ago the fellow who was like abrother to me convicted with Ellis in his methamphetamine bust was a partnerin Metabolife Chatterbox had felt certain this damning fact would make thecut but it didnt            The segment wraps up with a review of Metabolifes Webcampaign against ABC News and gives the final word to the formerly comatoseCunninghamPotier I wouldnt have taken it if Id known the side effectsbecause I almost didnt make it I almost died            So who wins Round Two It depends on how you score itIf the question is whether ABC News ran a fairminded expose then ABC Newswins If the question is whether Metabolifes online intimidation campaign gotABC to pull a punch or two  well you could argue that Metabolife wins Ifthe question is whether people who read Metabolifes raw transcript will comeaway with a more favorable view of the company than if they just watch  Metabolife clearly loses And if the questionis whether Chatterbox who could stand to lose a few pounds will now ever betempted to try Metabolife as a product ABC News wins big
