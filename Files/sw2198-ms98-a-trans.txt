                so   so what movies have you seen lately   i really havent seen any movies lately i the only two movies ive seen were uh uh King Ralph which really was depressing wasnt any any good   oh was bad   yeah   oh thats disappointing i was thinking about going to see that   and well its not worth the whatever five bucks or four four fifty whatever you pay for you know to get into the movie but   yeah wait for it to come out on videotape i guess   yeah yeah or i saw Chima Para Diso uh Chima Para Diso   whats the other one oh say that again whats that   its a foreign film   uhhuh   its a an Italian film about uh this guy who uh who from when he was a little kid like ten years old   uhhuh oh Cinema Para De Simo oh okay because youre saying it with a youre saying it little Italian oh are you Italian oh okay thats why go ahead   yeah italian accent yeah yeah its its about a movie about you know this guy who was running a a movie   uhhuh   you know movie studio whatever he ran he ran a machine that was pretty good didnt you think so   yeah i saw it too yeah it was i really liked it my wife and i loved it yeah   i thought yeah i thought that most Americans might not like it because you know of its its not that good of a quality film but i mean its the meaning behind it that i liked   uhhuh yep thats true yeah it had a really uh i thought the story was really nice and i thought uh the guy that played the projectionist i just thought was superb you know he was great uh and the little boy was good too   uhhuh i i thought they did an excellent job of actually aging the person you know from when he was a little kid to little older to little older to except the last the very last you know the last person the last actor that played the kid   uhhuh   you know when he had gray hair he didnt look anything like him but you know up until that point they did a really good job of keeping you know an actor who   yeah yeah yeah they did well i think thats the guy that uh it was like his story   uhhuh   i think he was like a Italian director or something like that and i think that was himself he was he that was his own story   right yeah   on whats made him successful or whatever yeah so of course he picked probably all these really good looking young people you know yeah yeah i liked that too yeah um we um my wife and i are planning on trying to go see um   yeah   uh Silence of The Lambs tonight   yeah i hear thats pretty good   yeah its a suspense well i guess its ranked number one now its supposed to be pretty good suspenseful yeah but are you good at do you like suspenseful movies like that yeah because see i im not really one that likes real suspense i like the nice lighthearted comedies most of the time   oh is it yeah i do well it depends on what mood youre in too you know   yeah thats true yeah but uh   like for example Tequila Sunrise i liked that   yeah well that well that was thats with uh whos whats his names in it uh   uh i dont know   Mel Gibson and uh whats his yeah that was a good movie too that was good i   yeah is that supposed to be something like that one   yeah yeah something like that except its its supposed to be really you know suspenseful yeah so i guess but you know were its been rated pretty well and every all the critics like it so and every word of mouth has been pretty good on it so   yeah thats pretty good   yeah were were going to go see that probably tonight   well what have you seen that that   uh actually lets see we we uh weve rented a couple movies lately you know because you get them on videotape we rented uh just last night we watched um David Lynchs uh movie Blue Velvet   uhhuh   which which is that it it sort of has some of the some of the music behind it did you ever watch Twin Peaks   no i dont watch that show   yeah well that it has some of the music weve watched we watched Twin Peaks because uh uh a little bit so it have you know and i think she had seen part of it before   uhhuh   friends of hers had rented it and shed seen part of it but we thought wed rent the whole thing and actually its a pretty good movie but its not great you know   uhhuh   they said its supposed to be really weird but because that David Lynch has like a weird style but i didnt think it was really weird you know not as weird as i dont know i we also   uhhuh maybe you expected too much out of it   yeah i think yeah thats probably true yeah we also saw Wild At Heart which is also a David Lynch movie that that that had been out now that was a weird movie   uhhuh Wild At Heart   that was yeah that was   about what   it was it was about uh a guy uh Nicholas Cage does Elvis Presley like a like a pseudo Elvis Presley impersonation through the whole movie hes like a real violent uh   uhhuh   twenty year old and he uh hes in love with this girl thats about sixteen or seventeen and they leave hes involved with like a murder and then um he they go to uh they go to like Louisiana and Texas and uh he get they get more he gets more involved with this robbery and whatever but its sort of   so he just gets in trouble everywhere   yeah he gets in trouble everywhere he goes its real violent   um   and uh you know which is like what David Lynchs other movies were about you know the so i dont know i just i didnt think it was that good my wife liked it a little bit more than i did she looks she looks at more some of the uh more creativeness behind it you know she likes the different type of movies   yeah yeah   yeah but i didnt think it was that good   i dont i dont like to look too deep into movies if its good its good if its not its not   yeah that thats sort of the way i feel too i dont know what else we just saw something recently     yeah i want to go see The Doors thats what i want to go see   yeah they say thats pretty good well how old are you   im twenty one   twenty one oh see youre young so you you see im thirty one so you see this as like a mythical thing you know so youre like   uhhuh right well i mean i i you know im pretty familiar with the story of Jim Morrison i mean i dont know everything about it but   yeah uhhuh yeah its one of the things uh if you read in the newspapers and stuff hes the critics really like it or they really dont   uhhuh   yeah so i think uh but i think its supposed to be well done   uh i heard i heard that it that what what is it Siskel and Ebert someone told me that Siskel and Ebert said that one of the two liked the whole movie but he doesnt like the ending so he wouldnt recommend the movie and he didnt like the ending because   uhhuh   of the way Jim Morrisons life ended and its like thats ridiculous i mean thats a true life story How can you not like something that really you know is if it happened it happened youre just telling a story   right yeah  yeah uhhuh thats true yeah i guess i guess uh i well i was watching uh Arsenio Hall the other night and uh   uhhuh   the actor that plays Jim Morrisons one of the other uh   Val Kilmer   uh not Val Kilmer the um Tom McLaughlin who plays one of the other characters in the band one of the other men in the band uh was on was on uh Arsenio and he was talking about it you know and uh he said that uh they tried to stick pretty much to you know   uhhuh the real story yeah   the real story and and and for to for all of them to get an understanding of how their characters were they could they watched older videotapes you know of their them in interviews and things like that so they tried to make it pretty you know close to the line   right   but uh they also said that whatever the guy that directed it   yeah   i dont  he uh hes very he really liked The Doors so it was very much his impression too you know so so if you have   right yeah Oliver Stone isnt it   yeah yeah and hes a very strong willed person and his his ideas whatever came through you know with however so they said if if you um   yeah but hes a good director so i mean he should still be able to   yeah so so if you like his view and his direction in other words then youll really like the movie you know so probably if you liked his other two movies uh those are like Wall Street and Platoon then   uhhuh oh i liked Platoon it was all right but i didnt see Wall Street   yeah yeah if you like Platoon yeah if you liked Platoon youll probably really like this because it takes pretty much the same direction for the time you know uh i think   yeah   so thats uh because he has a pretty strong will and he directs his own way so it should be you know pretty good   well i think ill go see that this weekend or next weekend one or the other   yeah   because i really want to see it i wanted to see it uh about two weeks ago when i had a chance to go see it but i i went home for the weekend and they didnt have it playing home   uhhuh   for like spring break and   yeah oh you in college   yeah im still in college   well why are you participating in this study   uh my uh roommate took a voice over course   yeah umhum   and they told him to sign up for this and he asked me if i wanted to do it and i said sure you know its like just you know to help out whatever you know the the more participants you have the bigger   yeah yeah yeah the more participants the better it works out because im a voice researcher   uh you get a bigger pool of all the different regions of and and   right uhhuh yeah thats true   i guess they wouldnt be called dialects but theyre pretty close sometimes     yeah thats what theyre yeah thats what theyre really looking for i think just how we speak also looking where we pause and where we dont things like that yeah but thats pretty thats good um what do you get many movies on campus   right yeah well the the good thing about campus is that we have this uh system that uh uh its a its called UAB uh university something or other i dont know and they give out like movies they show movies in the theatre for a dollar   uhhuh right yeah   and and so you know like every other day or or so they have like movies for a dollar Sometimes theyre even free i think uh they showed uh Chima Para Diso free   uhhuh   uhhuh   uh but i missed it so i rented it the other day   yeah yeah because my wife and i saw it in the theatre we really liked it   uhhuh yeah i liked it but i didnt i didnt know if the Americans would like it so much they might you know look into it and say uh this is low budget film and its not really that good but i mean i like the story   yeah it was a great thats a i think thats thats one thing too um you know you cant get so much caught up in the expense     right   as as you do a good telling a good story and i thought that was that movie really told a good story   yeah yeah   and and i think if you really like the story going along with it you dont notice that its a little bit you know it might not have as many camera angles or it may not have   right   you know uh because the you know the character actors the town the community people were just great they just seem so real you know they came right off the screen   they were they were i mean i you know i i go to Italy every summer except i missed last summer but i mean its like that you go into the small towns especially you know like in where he was in Sicily   uhhuh uhhuh   and the southern part of Italy everything is like that you know and no one has any money you know you just barely get by But everybody is like a big family and its like its just like that so thats why i liked it i guess im a little biased but i i i i i thought   right but see i really think yeah i i think those characters came right off the screen in that story you know it was really enjoyable and and my wife we thought the same thing we were so pleasantly surprised   yeah
