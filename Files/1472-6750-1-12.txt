                    Background        The analysis of gene function during mammalian embryonic        development relies heavily on the use of transgenic mice        However expression of alleles that result in embryonic        lethality cannot be studied using regular transgenic        procedures because lines of founder mice cannot be        established Analysis of such alleles in mammals has        historically relied upon transient transgenic procedures            In this approach fertilized eggs are injected with a        transgene construct and allowed to develop to a        predetermined embryonic stage         in utero before being collected for        phenotypic analysis Using this method a variable number of        transgenes integrate into random genomic loci        Unfortunately the local chromosomal environment can affect        expression of the integrated transgene and this can result        in unpredictable transgene expression Moreover because no        founder line is established it is not possible to repeat an        analysis with a specific transgenic mouse embryo        The problem of random transgene integration can be        overcome by targeting transgenes to a specific genomic        locus by homologous recombination in ES cells       A        method that allows the introduction of single copy        transgenes into the Xlinked         hprt locus has been described        previously by Bronson         et al     In this approach        singlecopy transgenes are introduced  of the         hprt locus by homologous        recombination in ES cells This is an extremely efficient        procedure because targeted clones have reconstituted the         hprt gene and are selected on the        basis of growth in HAT medium Following this method        upward of  of HAT resistant ES cell clones contain        correctly targeted transgenes     The         hprt locus is a particularly suitable        site for the integration of transgenes because it exists as        an Xlinked gene present as a single copy in male ES cells        Moreover the         hprt gene is ubiquitously expressed        and so provides a favorable chromatin environment for        transgene expression Indeed it has been demonstrated that        the level of expression of transgenes inserted into the         hprt locus is directed solely by        exogenous transcriptional regulatory elements            Furthermore mice derived from independent ES cells clones        containing a transgene expressed from the same promoter all        exhibit comparable levels of expression               Although the targeting of constructs to the         hprt locus facilitates consistent        expression of transgenes it does not overcome the need to        generate founder lines of transgenic mice However        pioneering work by Nagy         et al has shown that embryos and mice        can be derived directly from R ES cells by aggregating        them with tetraploid embryos      This suggests that        controlled expression of transgenes encoding possible        gainoffunction and developmentallethal alleles could be        achieved by generating embryos andor mice from ES cells        containing transgenes inserted into the         hprt locus Unfortunately the        generation of mice and embryos by tetraploid aggregation        from available Hprt negative ES cell lines has proven to be        inefficient and unreliable SAD unpublished In this        report we describe the generation of a new Hprt negative        ES cell line that is compatible with the tetraploid        aggregation procedure Moreover we demonstrate that it        facilitates efficient targeting of transgenes to the         hprt locus as well as the subsequent        generation of clonal transgenic mouse embryos that express        the transgene in a promoterdependent manner                    Results        Nagy         et al demonstrated that embryos and        mice could be derived solely from R ES cells by        aggregating them with tetraploid embryos      Although        we were able to repeat these data using R ES cells we were        unable to generate midgestation embryos from        ETGaderived strains of         hprt negative ES cell lines using the        same approach       We believed it was unlikely        that Hprt itself was required to generate ES cellderived        embryos because         hprt knockout mice are viable and        fertile     ETGaderived ES cell lines contain a        large spontaneous deletion encompassing  kb of the         hprt locus     Therefore it        seemed possible that sequences within this region were        necessary to maintain ES cell pluripotency However we        believed a more likely scenario was that the available        lines contained unrelated genetic or epigenetic alterations        that were incompatible with the aggregation procedure        Consistent with this interpretation Eggan         et al have recently shown that viable        offspring are more efficiently produced through        tetraploidmediated cloning from outbred ES cell line        compared to inbred ES cell lines     We therefore        believed it likely that aggregationcompatible         hprt negative ES cells could be        generated by targeted mutation of the         hprt gene in R ES cells To test        this we generated a targeting vector to replace exon  of        the mouse         hprt gene with a         neomycin phosphotransferase        neo gene that conferred resistance to te        pharmacological inhibitor G in ES cells fig a        Following transfection of this plasmid into R cells         clones that were resistant to G were collected and grown        in the presence of thioguanine to select for loss of Hprt        activity Of the original  Gresistant clones that        were harvested only one named F was also resistant to        thioguanine and sensitive to growth in HAT medium fig        b The integrity of the targeting event was next        confirmed by Southern blot analysis of F genomic DNA As        shown in fig athe correct integration of Neo at the         hprt locus was predicted to delete a        BamH restriction endonuclease cutsite from intron  and        replace it with a BamH site that is unique to the mutant         hprt allele This restriction        fragment polymorphism could be detected using an         hprtspecific probe fig a The        wild type BamH fragment was predicted to be  kb based        on sequence analysis while the mutant fragment should be         kb Fig cshows that digestion of wildtype R ES cell        DNA with BamH did indeed generate a  kb fragment that        could be detected with intron  probe In contrast F        cells were shown to have replaced this fragment with an         kb BamH fragment thereby confirming the integrity of the        targeting event        For F cells to be a suitable vehicle for the generation        of transgenic mice they should be competent to generate        chimeric mice that can transmit alleles through the        germline To test the germline potential of F cells we        first generated chimeric mice by aggregating F ES cells        with CD morulae and allowing them to develop to term         in utero The resulting chimeric        males were bred with CD females and the genotype of        offspring determined by Southern blot analysis of genomic        DNA from mouse tails Fig cshows that agouti F female        mice contained both the mutant paternal and wild type        maternal         hprt alleles In contrast the agouti        F male mice contained only a wildtype         hprt allele inherited from the        maternal Xchromosome as expected From this we were able        to conclude that F         hprt null ES cells are indeed        competent to transmit alleles through the germline and that        the resulting offspring were fertile and viable as reported        previously            We next addressed whether embryos could be generated        solely from F Hprt negative ES cells by aggregating these        cells with tetraploid CD embryos and allowing them to        develop         in utero until day  of gestation        El  Figs abcshow that F cells could indeed give        rise to normal embryos n   All embryos exhibited        characteristic features of midgestation stages of        development including normal rostralcaudal patterning        beating hearts normal limb formation including the        formation of fingers F cells derive from the agouti        pigmented SVJ strain of mice In contrast albino        CD mice donated the tetraploid morulae used in the        aggregation procedure The finding shown in figs abc        that all the resulting embryos displayed clear retinal        pigmentation strongly implied that the embryos were F ES        cellderived We confirmed this by determining the genotype        of the embryos by Southern blot analyses of genomic DNA        Fig dshows that all embryos contained a restriction        fragment polymorphism that was indicative of deletion of         hprt exon No wild type         hprt allele was detected confirming        that the embryos were generated entirely from F cells        These data demonstrate that the         hprt gene is not essential for the        generation of embryos from ES cells by tetraploid        aggregation and that F cells should could provide a        suitable vehicle for the direct generation of transgenic        mouse embryos        Previously it has been shown that a targeting vector        pMP can correct the loss of Hprt activity in ETGa ES        cells that lack exons  and  of the         hprt gene      The design of        this vector implied that it should also be capable of        correcting the         hprt exon  deficiency in F cells        and could therefore be used to introduce transgenes into        the         hprt locus by homologous        recombination To test this we generated a modified vector        based on pMP The practical features of this modification        are that it removes the lacZ sequences in the vector        backbone and reduces the overall size of the vector both        of which improve subsequent cloning steps This vector        pMPNEBLacZ contains a  arm of homology consisting of         kb of mouse          hprt genomic DNA flanking a unique        Not restriction endonuclease cut site The  arm of        homology contains  kb of the human         hprt gene that includes exon and         kb of mouse genomic sequence that includes exon  fig a        as described previously     Homologous recombination        at the modified         hprt locus in F cells should        substitute genomic DNA containing         hprt exons  and  for         neo thereby reconstituting a gene        encoding active Hprt fig a Moreover only cells having        undergone a successful homologous recombination event        should become HAT resistant and carry the targeted        transgene To assess the efficiency of this approach we        attempted to target a LacZ reporter transgene whose        expression is controlled by the promoter from the alpha        myosin heavy chain MHC gene to the modified         hprt locus in F cells We chose the        MHC promoter because others have demonstrated using        traditional transgenic procedures that it directs high        levels of reporter gene expression specifically in cardiac        tissue of early mouse embryos       Cells were        selected for resistance to HAT following electroporation of        the          MHCLacZ transgenecontaining        plasmid  HAT resistant cells lines were collected and        their genotype determined by Southern blot analysis Fig        cshows that in contrast to F cells a probe that        specifically recognizes the LacZ transgene identified a         kb EcoRV fragment in HATresistant ES cell lines Of the         HATresistant colonies retrieved  contained LacZ        Furthermore fig bshows that these cells had become G        and thioguanine sensitive confirming that the         neo gene had indeed been replaced        with         hprt coding sequences in the F        cells These data confirm that this selection strategy is        extremely efficient in identifying ES cell clones        containing correctly targeted transgenes            The ultimate use of this procedure is to generate clonal        transgenic mouse embryos directly from the modified ES        cells Success in this would provide a system in which to        express alleles with potentially lethal phenotypes in the        developing embryo We therefore determined whether        embryos could be generated from the F cells that contained        an MHCLacZ transgene and whether these embryos        appropriately expressed galactosidase E embryos were        generated from three independent MHCLacZ cell lines and        stained for expression of galactosidase Representative        embryos shown in fig dall developed normally and        expressed high levels of galactosidase in the developing        heart mimicking the expression of endogenous MHC            Importantly none of the embryos exhibited ectopic patterns        of expression lending further support to the proposal that        expression of transgenes introduced to the         hprt locus is primarily dependent on        the accompanying transcriptional regulatory elements                               Discussion and conclusions        Here we have described the generation of an ES cell line        and a procedure that will allow the phenotypic analyses of        transgenic embryos expressing lethal alleles This        procedure is an important addition to the available        repertoire of molecular genetic techniques available to        developmental biologists because it overcomes several        deficiencies associated with alternative transient        transgenic approaches normally used to study        gainoffunction and dominantnegative alleles Traditional        procedures rely on the generation of transgenic embryos        through micro injection of fertilized mouse eggs Using        this approach an unpredictable number of transgenecopies        are incorporated at a random location in the recipient        genome This can result in ectopic expression of the        transgene because both copy number and the site integration        can influence transgene expression        In the approach described here a targeting vector that        contains exon  of the         hprt gene along with a specific        transgene is used to reconstitute Hprt activity in Hprt        negative ES cells Successful targeting of the transgene to        the         hprt locus in Hprt negative ES cells        can be selected by growing transfected cells in HAT medium        The efficiency of this selection procedure is such that        close to all HAT resistant colonies contain a correctly        targeted transgene Moreover because the transgene is        introduced into the         hprt locus its expression is        dependent upon the inclusion of specific transcriptional        regulatory elements and remains relatively unaffected by        the local chromatin environment     A major advantage        of this targeted transgenic approach compared to        traditional transgenics is that transgene expression is        predictable so expression at ectopic sites is largely        avoided The availability of F Hprt negative ES cells        allows transgenic embryos to be derived directly from        transgenic ES cells by aggregating the cells with        tetraploid embryos and allowing them to develop         in utero Each embryo is in effect        clonal because it is generated from a single clonal ES cell        line This allows reproducible comparison of the phenotype        generated by a given transgene at different developmental        stages Moreover because the transgene is present as a        single copy at a known site of integration it circumvents        the need to generate many different transgenic lines from a        given construct as is the case when using a transient        transgenic procedure        There are many potential uses for this method of        generating transgenic mouse embryos The most obvious is        that it provides a mechanism for generating embryos that        express alleles that are predicted or known to be        detrimental to normal embryonic development for example        dominantnegative or gainoffunction alleles Indeed the        expression of dominant negative alleles that can        potentially disrupt multiple members of a gene family has        been used extensively in Xenopus laevis and has for        example helped elucidate the action of fibroblast growth        factors during mesoderm formation     Such alleles are        particularly useful when a null allele in the same gene        causes a disruptive phenotype prior to the stage of        development of interest Choosing a promoter that expresses        the dominant negative allele later in development or in a        specific cell type could potentially circumvent any early        phenotype associated with a null allele        Another important use of this procedure could be to        identify transcriptional regulatory regions that control        expression of specific genes during development Transgenic        mice have been extensively used to identify regulatory        elements that control gene expression         in vivo      This has in turn        allowed the elucidation of regulatory networks that control        cell differentiation during development In this regard        the use of F cells coupled with targeting transgenes to        the         hprt locus offers two major        advantages over traditional transgenic approaches The        first is that it is extremely rapid Once the targeting        construct is in hand it takes approximately four to five        weeks to generate transgenic mouse embryos The second        advantage is due to the presence of the transgene at a        known and constant integration site This potentially        allows the comparison of levels of reporter gene expression        driven by different promoters thereby offering a        quantitative         in vivo transgenic assay        In sum the availability of tetraploid        aggregationcompetent ES cells that support targeting of        transgenes to the         hprt locus should facilitate the        rapid analysis of transcriptional regulatory elements         in vivo as well as the phenotypic        characterization of alleles that are incompatible with        normal development We therefore believe that F cells        provide a powerful new tool for molecular geneticists                    Materials and Methods                  Plasmids                      pHprt            The targeting plasmid used to delete             hprt exon was called pHprt to            indicate this deletion It was derived from the plasmid            pOSDUPDEL that contained the             neomycin phosphotransferase            neo gene that confers resistance to the            pharmacological inhibitor G and also contains the            Herpes Simplex Virus             thymidine kinase HSVTK that            confers sensitivity to gancyclovir Importantly the             neo gene is flanked by             loxP sequences permitting loss of            G resistance where useful pHprt was constructed by            introducing a  Kb BamHIHindIII fragment of              hprt genomic DNA ETGa origin            from the plasmid pMP into the Hpa site of pOSDUPDEL                The ends of the fragments were made blunt            using Klenow The  arm of homology was introduced            into the unique Bcl site of the previous plasmid as a             Kb BamHI fragment from pMPSV origin that            contained murine             hprt exons  and                                 pMPNEBLacZ            The plasmid pMPNEBLacZ was generated by ligating            an  kb Xba fragment from pMP into the Xba site of            pNEB New England Biolabs from which LacZ sequences            had been removed as a NarIEcoRI fragment     This                        hprt replacement vector contains            a  arm of             hprt homology consisting of             kb of mouse              hprt genomic DNA flanking a            unique Not cloning site The  arm of homology            contains  kb of the human             hprt gene that includes exon and             kb of mouse genomic sequence that includes exon             A detailed description of the pMP targeting vector            from which these sequences were derived has been            described previously     A partial nucleotide            sequence of pMPNEBLacZ is available from SAD upon            request                                pMHCLacZHprt            This targeting vector was constructed by inserting a             kb MHCLacZ expression cassette into the NotI site            of pMPNEBLacZ The  kb MHCLacZ expression            cassette was constructed by inserting a  kb            SalIHindIII fragment from pLacF containing a             lacZ gene that incorporates a            nuclear localization signal into the SalIHindIII site            of an MHC expression module                                    ES cell culture gene targeting and          selection          All ES cell lines were cultured on mitotically          inactivated primary embryonic fibroblasts in ES cell          medium supplemented with recombinant leukemia inhibitory          factor LIF as described elsewhere     F cells          were generated by introducing  g of Not digested          pHPRT plasmid into    R ES cells by          electroporation at  voltsfresistance  using a          BTX ECM electroporation system     Cells          containing           neo were selected by supplementing          the ES cell medium with  gml Geneticin G          GibcoBRL and negative selection against           Hsvtk gene expression was achieved          by including  M gancyclovir Roche To identify cells          that had lost HPRT activity Ggancyclovirresistant          colonies were collected and expanded in  well plates in          the presence of  gml thiogaunine Introduction of          transgenes into the           hprt locus of F cells was achieved          using the following procedure F cells were grown for          two passages in media containing  gml thioguanine           g of linear targeting vector plasmid was introduced          into    F ES cells by electroporation Cells were          grown for  days before adding HAT Sigma to the growth          medium HAT resistant colonies were harvested after           days growth in HATcontaining medium                          Tetraploid and diploid embryo aggregation          EScell derived embryos were generated by aggregating          clumps of around twenty ES cells with individual eight          cell embryos or four cell embryos that had been made          tetraploid by electrofusion as described previously                ES cellembryo aggregates were cultured overnight          and those that formed blastocysts were transferred to the          uteri of psuedopregnant females surrogate mothers To          generate chimeric mice the embryos were allowed to          develop to term ES cellderived embryos were harvested          at predetermined developmental stages and DNA prepared          for Southern blot analysis or fixed and processed to          identify galactosidase expression using standard          protocols
