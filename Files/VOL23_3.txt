                              By Their Notes Ye Shall Know Them A Look at Onomatopoeic Ornithonymy            According to the great Danish linguist OttoJespersen there are five theories to account forthe origin of language the bowwow theory inwhich speech imitated animal calls the poohpoohtheory in which people made instinctive soundsthrough physical or emotional reactions the dingdongtheory in which people reacted to the environmentthe yoheho theory in which peoplespoke when working together and the lala theoryin which speech arose from the romantic side of life            If bird names are anything to go by the bowwowtheory perhaps we should call it the tweettweettheory rules the roost since many birds arenamed for their songs or calls  This even holds for thegeneric cock hen and chick   The farmyard cock is socalled for its clucks as illustrated by Chaucer in TheNuns Priests Tale in which Chanticleer cryde anoncok cok  The cockerels cockadoodledoo is anextension of this as a cocks crow  The hen is so calledfor her singing with a name related to Latin canereto sing and so to English chant   Chanticleer thoughmale has a name meaning one who sings clearlyThe chicken has a name related to that of the cock with its changed vowel representing its less powerfulcry  The chick  as a young bird is named from it            Outside the farmyard but still usually withinfarmland territory the crow and rook are both namedfor their harsh call or caw  and though less commonthe chough and the raven are similarly named  Thechoughs cry has been described as kyaw  and the ravens as prruk suggesting the name of the physicallyrelated rook   The corncrakes cry has been verbalizedas crex  which adequately represents the crake that isthe basic form of the name            Elsewhere afield the curlew  with its cry of courli is obviously named as is the cuckoo  whose name issimilar in many languages French coucou  GermanKuckuck  Greek kokkux  Latin cuculus   The firstpart of its name is in fact directly related to that of thecock  as the initial cuck  of its call corresponds to thefarmyard birds cluck                           The jackdaw also belongs to the crow familyCorvidae  and daw represents its chak   It does itbetter in Italian than English where the bird is a taccola from earlier tacca   The first part of its name is            the personal name Jack   The sparrow does not itselfhave an imitative name although it was formerly nicknamedPhilip  for its rapid twittering and chirpingnotes  Hence John Skeltons early thcentury poemPhyllyp Sparowe  a lament by a young lady for her petsparrow killed by a cat with the affecting linesNothynge it auayledTo call Phylyp agayneWhomGyb our cat hath slayne            Another bird with an imitative name prefixed bya personal name is the magpie   Here pie is related toLatin pipere to chirp  There are other birds withpi  or its equivalent in their names similarly such asthe peewit pipit  and even the pigeon   True pigeonscoo  but the bird derives its name from the onomatopoeicbase pip  that imitates the chirp of a youngbird and that also gave English pipe   Hence also themore obvious name of the sandpiper  a bird that pipesor peeps  on the sands            We are now by the seaside where the gull has aname representing its repeated kyow kyow   Theseagull is also known as the mew  likewise an imitativename  Another aquatic bird is the goose  whose namerepresents its distinctive honk  The male of thespecies the gander  has a directly related name asdoes the gannet   Its cry is described as a barkingarrah   Still with the water birds the heron is namedfor its harsh cry rrank the name itself is related tothat of the hen   The bittern is a further wading birdits cry is usually described as a boom and the firstpart of its name from Latin butio  represents thisYet another water dweller is the garganey  a kind ofduck  Its name represents its distinctive quacking            On dry land the finch is named for its prolongednasal tsweee  mostly clearly heard in the greenfinchThe siskin is in the same family and has a similarnameand indeed a similar call  A harsher note issounded by the shrike  whose name is related toscreech and shriek   The quail is so called not becauseit is timid but because the call of the female is a doublenote queep queep   The quail is a gamebird as isthe partridge   Its own name is equally imitative notof its voice but of the sharp whirring sound made byits wings when it suddenly flies up  This sounds likea fart  a related word  Compare Greek perdix partridgeand perdesthai to break wind  Quite a differentsound is made by the owl whose name representsits familiar hoot otherwise the final longernote of its conventional call tuwhit tuwhoo   Englishhowl is a related word  French hibou also imitates thebirds call as does its German name Eule  a diminutiveform of Uhu  eagle owl            Even the little wren has an echoic name as muchmore obviously does the chiffchaff  although its chiffsand chaffs are usually repeated in irregular order suchas chiff chiff chiff chaff chiff chaff   A rarer bird butalso with an obviously onomatopoeic name is thehoopoe   Its farcarrying poopoopoo is also represenedin its Latin name Upupa epops   Its nameevokes the equally exotic bobolink bulbul and whippoorwill with their clearly echoic names  The lastbird is an American nightjar  where jar is also an imitativeword referring to its loud churring cry   Churrand jar are related words  The nightingale does nothave a directly imitative name although the final galeis related to yell  which is undoubtedly echoic            It is tempting to relate the yellowhammers nameto yammer German jammern  referring to its fussycall a rapid chichichichichi chweee  traditionallyrendered littlebitofbreadandnocheese  But theorigin of the name is disputed  The first part of thename indicates the colour of the birds head and underparts            Finally in this bouquet of bird names let ussavour the rail  whose repeated gep gep gep andgroaning and grunting notes suggest a death rattle  arelated word  They order things more neatly inFrance

The Cornish way with words tends to be as salty astheir native pilchards  Many old sayings areconcerned with cutting people down to size andshrewd thrusts are meant to find their mark            The slowwitted are often described as LikeTregony bandthree scats beats behind or astoo slow to carry a cold dennar dinner  Strongerstill is the old gibe Put in weth the bread and tookout weth the cakes often muttered behind the deficientones back  Any sign of putting on airs or assertivenessis frowned upon and one still hears crudejokes like Quietness is the best noise as UncleJohnny said when he knocked down his wife orDressed to death like Sally Hatch  Mournful lookswere crisply dismissed in Old Cornwall as lookinglike a dying duck in a thunderstorm  Greed toowas discouraged with a terse reminder You dontneed that any more than a toad needs side pockets            The famous Cornish pasties provide the sayingAs long as Jan Bedellas fiddle if a new young cookmakes a misshapen pasty  For the Cornish tend to berather a critical race owing to their struggle to makeends meet in a county which has long known economichardship  A hardpressed life naturally tends toblunt speech            Of a bandylegged individual you will hear Hecouldnt stop a pig in a passage and of lank hairlike a yard of pump water  Even a contented personis often heard to say Ahm happy on me own dungheap with typical Cornish selfmockery  Ask anolder inhabitant for his or her age and you may wellget the familiar reply As old as my little finger and abit older than my teeth  In a strongminded countylike Cornwall an individual may be admired as beingas tough as Hancocks motheran archetypaldragon lady rooted in local history            Being a Celtic nation the Cornish cleave naturallyto vivid descriptions  Any sign of restlessness forinstance is summed up as All of a motion like aMulfra toad on a red hot shovel and when shiveringit is a case of cold as a quilkin frog or chilled tothe marra marrow  Although pushiness is not aquality naturally approved of in Cornwall neither isundue modesty standing in his own light like theMayor of Market Jew another apocryphal figurePride is rebuked as

forthcoming Water bewitched andtea begrudged            More encouraging are the old Cornish sayingsTurn the best side to London Show off the bestside of anything and Cheer up youll live till youdie  More rough good humour comes out in the oftheard Youll do it bit by bit as the cat said when sheswallowed the hatchet Ill manage but its a tightfit            Dark explanations may be given for

money thenyou can cut tie and buy  Count your blessings howevermeagre as a toad is a diamond in a ducks eye            The idea that someone has been in a situationvery like your own long before you is very prevalentin these old Cornish sayings  Often this has a warningnote like Lady Fan Todd dressed to death and killedwith fashion is one so is the curious Childrenstongues will cut your throat with a bar of soap or hangyou with a yard of cotton  Just as strange is the gluttonywarning like Tommy Dumplens after guldizesupper carry me home and dont bend me for Imfeeling rather possed up  Vanity in young girls ischecked by Nobody will stop their horse galloping tolook at you            Throughout all these sayings a downright judgmentaltone can be heard summed up in the oldCornish last word Theer tes it is an caant be notesser  No arguing with that                                             ANTIPODEAN ENGLISH                                          Settlement by Sea            Astride Port Jackson the city of Sydney marksthe site of the first European settlement in AustraliaFrom Sydney a second convict settlement was establishedat Hobart in Tasmania  To the north onMoreton Bay in Queensland Brisbane was foundedto the south on Port Phillip Bay in Victoria MelbourneWestward round the southern coastAdelaide was first approached from the sea as was atthe western extreme Perth  In time overland routesbetween these cities Hobart of course excludedwere found but for much of the th century whatare now the capital cities of the six Australian Stateswere most easily reached by sea            In each of these the linguistic situation obtainingin Sydney was replicated  The settlers quickly discoveredthat knowledge of Dharuk the Aboriginallanguage spoken in Sydney was of no help to them incommunicating with the local Aboriginesunless theAborigines had learned words from the settlers in thebelief that they were English as indeed happenedwith some pidgin terms and in the west withboomerang   In each new settlement therefore borrowingbegan anew  So in Brisbane dialects ofYagara were the first encountered and the source ofsome sixteen loan words  In Melbourne the Victorianlanguages Wuywurung spoken in three dialects onthe site of Melbourne and to the north and west andWathawurung spoken on the western side of PortPhillip Bay were the first source of borrowingsthough the surviving words number no more than sixteenThe language spoken on the site of AdelaideGaurna though unusually well recordedbyLutheran missionaries who were amongst the earlysettlersagain yielded only about ten loans  The extremesare provided by the nameless Tasmanian languageswhich gave no more than three words toEnglish and Nyungar the language spoken over quitea large area in the southwest of Western Australia butessentially the language of the site of Perth whichhas enriched English with more than fifty loanwordsThe ignorance surrounding the Tasmanian languagesbetrays the fact that the relationships between convictsand later settlers and the Tasmanian Aborigineswere of a hostility unreached elsewhere the continuingfertility of Nyungar by contrast results from amuch happier and more accommodating relationship            One has to assume that the words which had aSydneybased currency in English were known tomost colonists because they had been encounteredeither in Sydney or in accounts of Sydney  Nonethelessthere is a sense in which each new settlementmeant a new start and consequently a duplication inthe nomenclature of key items  Gunyah  the Dharukword for dwelling is matched by the Melburnianquamby  a verb meaning lie down camp and also anoun meaning shelter by the Brisbane humpy  theAdelaide wurley  and the Perth mia mia   Of thesehump is now the most commonly used in the generalsense of a hut or temporary dwelling whether ofAboriginal or European provenance  And mia miahas been widely used in Victoria in this sense and inNew Zealand of a duckshooters hide  But the factremains that despite this diversity the English wordhut enjoyed a greater currency than any of the borrowingsbeing the usual word for the accommodationof the convict the rural labourer and theitinerant bushman            Australian pidgin acquired a second negativeborak  used as an alternative to baal or in a figurativesense for humbug nonsense or rubbish fromWathawurung whence came also an exclamation merrygigwell done and coolie  a derogatory term for aperson who partnered an Aboriginal woman  It isironic that lubra  a word for a black womanusuallya younger woman than is connoted by the Dharukgin was one of the few survivals of the Tasmanianlanguages in which it has been suggested that itmeant penis  From Yagara come bung brokendead yacka  both as a noun and a verb meaningwork and yohi  an affirmative all originally in pidgin            Other loanwords repeat the Sydney pattern strikingor otherwise significant flora fauna and weaponsbeing named so there is the Tasmanian boobialla  afruitbearing Acacia the Melburnian bullan bullan  abeautiful bird with a lyreshaped tail the Brisbaneyungan gong the Adelaide pinkie  a bilby or bandicootand the Perth quokka  a species of wallaby  Andthere are local names for weapons like weetweet  aVictorian missile used both as a weapon and as a toywirra  a South Australian club and kylie  a WestAustralian boomerang            Each new settlement meant a new beginning butso limited was the relationship between settlers andAborigines that there was little progress beyond thePort Jackson model  Not until travel by land supplementedand eventually replaced that by sea did incrementalborrowing became at least a possibility justas the passage of time meant that there was a likelihoodthat a language would be more fully and morecompetently recorded                              The Case of Nyungar            Exploration and settlement overland followedtravel by sea  In particular once the mountain barrierhad been overcome the settlers from the Sydney areamoved inland and to the north  Thus the languagesof the New South Wales inlandWiradhuri andKamilaroi and its dialect Yuwaalaraayformed partof a borrowing continuum which began with Dharukand which incorporated the Australian pidgin whichDavid Collins an officer of the First Fleet had describedas a barbarous mixture of English with thePort Jackson dialect  Words like gammon and piccaninny from English slang and African pidgin respectivelyjoined a range of Port Jackson words to form apidgin in which limited communication was possibleThis was added to as it travelled north and west bywords like yabber talk based on the root ya  foundin Wiradhuri and other languages the YagaraBrisbane words bung dead humpy dwelling andyacka work as noun and verb and particularly bynames for flora and fauna the travellers now recognizedas being commonly found in the inland  SoWiradhuri words like corella and ganggang  namesfor cockatoos kookaburra  a kingfisher boggi  a lizardbelah  a Casuarina billabong anabranch gilgai waterholeand bondi  a club became parts of everydayAustralian English as did the Kamilaroi words brolga a crane budgerigar  a small parrot coolamon woodenvessel or basin gundy  yet another word for hut andtowri country the traditional territory of an Aboriginalpeople the Yuwaalaraay words galah  a parrot andgidgee  an acacia and words common to Kamilaroiand Yuwaalaraay like the names of other species ofacacia such as boree and mulga   When a wouldbepoet writes the linesWhere the tangled boree blossomsWhere the gidya thickets waveAnd the tall yapunyahs shadowRests upon the stockmans grave                        he has in a sense guaranteed the currency of thewords he uses            Much the same sort of continuum exists in thewest where Nyungar which had a number of advantagesover Dharuk has provided for more than years a source of loan words  First the settlement inthe west took place some forty years after that in theeast and the settlers had a better idea of what theywere handling  Second though the language is nolonger spoken it was more fully and more intelligentlyrecorded than those first encountered  Andthird as a matter of governmental policy Aboriginalnames for flora and fauna have been preferred  Sofor instance the names of the farmed freshwater crayfishkoonac  and marron  have only short histories ofusage in English coincident with their utility thoughthey were first recorded in the th century  Andthere are substantial lists of the names of trees jarrahkarri mallett marri tuart  and wandoo and ofanimals chuditch dalgite dunnart kumarl noolbenger and numbat that are familiar at least in thewest            There are also words representative of otherareas of Aboriginal life such as boylya cleverman orwise elder gnamma waterhole kylie boomerangmiamia dwelling monaych  originally the name of acockatoo and by transference a police officer nyoongarAboriginal person wagyl  the mythical rainbowserpent wilgie  a red ochre used to paint thebody on ceremonial occasions and wongi  a word foran Aboriginal person originally used around Kalgoorlie            But though the Nyungar words supply a morecomprehensive picture of Aboriginal life than do theDharuk or those from any single inland language thegreater number of words used to denote key notionsof Aboriginal belief and life are special uses of Englishwords like cleverman which has replaced words likethe Dharuk koradji and the Nyoongar boylya  whichare effectively obsolete  So the Aboriginal equivalentof the Creation is Dreamtime  itself a translation ofalcheringa an Aranda word bark hut is preferredto gunyah or humpy country to the Kamilaroi towri and walkabout to the Nyungar pinkeye   And barkpaintings are known in the terms in which they arecharacterized by the European eye as dot or Xraypaintings  The language of the invaders is the languageof choice except in the artificially maintainedcase of the nomenclature of flora and fauna            In other words although the opportunity wasthere for borrowing on a larger scale and with a degreeof comprehensiveness that had not beenachieved hitherto it has not been taken  In the westas elsewhere in Australia the lexicographical evidenceof a developing understanding of the indigenous peoplesof Australia is slight indeed                              Proliferating Plurals and Some Singular Substitutions            It seems that reporters and other writers andspeakers have invented a new rule Whenever possibleuse plurals  Thus television radio and newspaperreporters tell usAids and assistances were given by the Red CrossThe conditions of the bombing victims are unknownAn oil spill has impacted ie affected many fishingcraftsDamages to the bridge from the collision were slightIt was a meeting of Republican Party faithfulsThe futures of American children are in

savings over the regular priceA retiring football coach always worried about theacademic standings of his athletesFog will lower visibilities today                        At the same time perhaps from an unconscious discomfortcaused by so many perplexing plurals therehas been a minitrend in the opposite direction  Oneform has been the de facto singularization of somecommonly used words of foreign origin L bacteriumdatum medium stratum  It graffito  LL fr Gk phenomenon Gk criterion   Though all are currentlybeing used almost exclusively in plural form they aretreated as if they were singular eg a bacteria etcThe more usual form of singularizing appears whenwe are told that someone is no longer in the goodgrace  of someone else the ground for divorce wasthe supervisor or custodian ie janitor

PanterDownes and Romeo Yench   I alsorecall with affection the late John Leaver who cycledaround the English countryside as a boy collectingpubnames  He was still collecting them in his seventies            John Leaver is not mentioned in this book whichis very thin on British material  Mr Dickson says forinstance that he has long had a special passion forapple names and quotes several hundred of thembut he ignores the National Apple Register of theUnited Kingdom  by uriel WG Smith which cataloguesthe names of  cultivars  Miss Smithonce amused herself by working  apple names intoa story which beganMrs Toogood whose daughter Alice was a LittleBeauty but rather a Coquette despaired of ever seeinga GoldenRing on the Ladys Finger                        We need not cavil of course at the absence of suchobvious reference sources in a work like this the authorhas the right to favour serendipity over methodicalresearch            Whether he has the right to be needlessly carelessin his statements is perhaps another matter  As atypical example we read that the word derrick  derivedfrom the surname of a famous hangman wasin use for centuries as a name for the gallows  Aglance at the citations in the OED or at Partridges articlein Name Into Word  which Dickson cites in hisbibliography would have made it clear that this usagedid not extend beyond the th century  It is alsonews to me that I once wrote a book called FirstNames  mentioned on page   Mr Dicksons definitionof name is itself rather unsatisfactory  Why arewe suddenly treated on page  to an incomplete listof ine words

flatulenceperdologists if such people exist but theseare not names            There is no need to include nonnames in a bookof this kind when we are surrounded by thousands ofminor nomenclatures  The

will at some stage do justice to the more scholarlywork that has been done especially on place namesand personal names  Names and naming rightly attractthe attention of philologists sociologists

Green has deservedly acquired themantle of Eric Partridge as the foremost authority onBritish slang  His books are many listed on the backflap of the dustjacket of this book are the MacmillanDictionary of Contemporary Slang The SlangThesaurus Neologisms New Words Since  SlangDown the Ages The Historical Development of Slang and The Dictionary of Jargon             The present work is a departure for him for mostof his earlier works have been reference books  Ihave heard some of Greens broadcasts and interviewsand he comes off quite well for he is smooth andglib just what is needed for radio  That style translatedinto book form however makes this book seemgreatly overwritten  Its main fault lies in the relianceon extensive quotations from the works describedthe sort of thing one expects to be paraphrased by ahistorian with the original matter buried in footnotesMercifully there are few such notes and they come atthe end of the book where they can be ignored  Theproblem with the quotations is that they are oftenquite long and neither interesting nor revealing oftenserving to support a point made by the author whomI would be happy to believe on his own recognizanceStill there are a number of errors which ought to becorrected for any subsequent edition or printing                        Greens account of the early history of dictionarymakingis very useful and interesting for it gatherstogether information about the personal lives andqualificationsor lack thereof of the famous lexicographersOne might quarrel with an occasionalcomment like The Techne  might be said to havebecome the basis of every Greek textbook that schoolboysin England and elsewhere would face until theyear  which must have encompassed a relativelysmall number but such are few and far between inthe earlier chapters of the book  It is not till we arriveat the final chapter The Modern World that seriousinadequacies rear their ugly heads            Green writesLexicographers have retained their priestly role especiallyin America and especially in the world ofwhat America terms college and Britain concisedictionariesp                         The simple facts are that American college ordesk dictionaries today contain about  entriesabout half that number of headwords up fromthe  they had till the s British concisedictionaries contain far fewer than that the ConciseOxford  the bestselling dictionary in the UK containsabout  entries probably not more than about headwords which is equivalent to what areclassed as concise dictionaries in America  As far asI am aware what are called college or desk dictionariesin America have no special label in Britainthough several notably the Collins Dictionary  are ofcomparable extent            Green is correct in writing that the unabridgedFunk  Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of the EnglishLanguage  gives two pronunciations for eachentry but he is mistaken in reporting that one representsthe popular pronunciation the other showingthe precise one p there are two pronunciationsbecause one employs a more popular presumablyunderstandable pronunciation key called in thephonetics trade a broad transcription while theother cleaves to a scholarly transcription called a narrowtranscription if such a pattern were followedtoday the first would be the simplified system usedgenerally in most dictionaries and the second wouldemploy the symbols of the International PhoneticAlphabet which for their more recondite transcriptionsrequire a trained phonetician for their understanding            In discussing the third edition of MerriamWebstersNew International Dictionary MWIIIGreen describes one of its main advances as a generalmove away from Americas traditional prescriptivelexicography towards a more descriptive Britishstyle Such a move had indeed taken place manyyears before Philip Goves editorship of the MWIIIand is evidenced in such works as the MerriamWebsterCollegiate Websters New World andAmerican College dictionaries among others  Someof these dictionaries contain notes describing contentiousissues of usage eg inferimply reason isbecausethat  etc but those are essentially reflectiveof the concerns of many users of the language hencecan be set forth as descriptive            On page  Green refers to the MWIII as containing headwords it does not of course itcontains  entries  The notion of entry as describedmany times in these pages includes  headwordinflected forms which in the sole case of theMWIII  includes regular inflections which pumpsup the entry count considerably  changes in partsof speech  embedded boldface entries like idiomsand phrases  runon forms those that are added atthe ends of entries to illustrate headwords with suffixesof transparent meaning added eg national and nationallyrun on to nation and nationalization run on tonationalize   spelling variants like British honournationalise nationalisation  etc  Thus a dictionarywith approximately  headwords the size ofAmerican college dictionaries contains more than entries  I do not know how many headwordsthe MWIII contains but it is far far fewer thanthe  entries claimed  Those who greet withconsternation what might seem to be a publishers fiddlingwith counts in dictionaries ought to know that thesystem for such counting was worked out in the smainly between MerriamWebster and the USTreasury Department which was then in charge of allgovernment purchases as a means for assessing the informationcontent of dictionaries being purchased forthe government a responsibility later shifted to anotherdepartment            On page  Green writesThere are after all a number of books of Americanismsbut none although there have been plans to fillthis gap of Briticisms                        That is not quite accurate for in  MacmillanUS Johnson  Bacon  in the UK publishedNorman W Schurs British SelfTaught revised andexpanded it was published as English English byVERBATIM BOOKS in  revised and expanded furtherit was published as British English A to Zed byFacts On File in about  It is not entirely accurateto describe Schurs book as a dictionary for althoughit is in alphabetical order by Briticism withthe American equivalent in the Index it combinesdefinitions with descriptions of cultural phenomenaas in the entry for the Ashes  which needs an explanationrather than a mere definition            Greens treatment of the Modern World of lexicographyis very thin on the ground  Bare mention ismade of the most important and bestselling dictionariespublished in the last fifty years when the sales ofall kinds of dictionaries exploded throughout theworld  It is probably true to say that an entire bookcould be written about this recent period in dictionarydevelopment including not only the reflection ofsound linguistic philosophy but the effects of the introductionof computers into the dictionary researchcompilation composition and accession as throughpersonal computers to CDROMS and diskettes certainlythere is more documented information about it thanthe period of several hundered years covered in the firstfourteen chapters of Chasing the Sun             But one must be grateful to Jonathon Green atleast for the first fourteen chapters which gather inone place an enormous amount of interesting usefulinformation about deceased

informationthat the world has become more bureaucracyriddenin the past few decades a trend that probably beganin the s to be reinforced through World War IIIt is probably the language that has borne much of theburden in that development the first citation foracronym in the OED   quotes American Notesand Queries  which refers to earlier unidentifiedusage of the term  In the early s we were besiegedby repl depots pronounced REPil DEPOZe GI and thousands of other acronyms and abbreviationsthe meaning of which we learned through daily repetitionon news broadcasts            I find it convenient to distinguish an abbreviationas a shortening that is not or cannot be pronouncedlike USA UN IOC GB NIH NAS RC OED IBM etc from an acronym as a shortening that is pronouncedas a word like ad lib NASA WRENOPEC COMSAT NATO  etc  Those who specializein this area prefer to subsume them all under the generalrubric initialism  a term quoted by the OEDfrom the s in Notes and Queries but one thatdid not become current I believe till Gale ResearchCompany published Acronyms and Initialisms Dictionary in   An enormous work that book hasgrown by the publication of periodic supplements                           Health Care Terms contains a good deal besidesinitialisms but I focus on those because they are probablymost representative of the jargon we are facedwith whenever we encounter the Bureaucracy as ifthe compounding of incomprehensible undescriptivejargon were not enough those who concoct that obfuscatinggobbledygook are not content till they haveturned it into an abbreviation or an acronym  The jargonalso becomes sprinkled with euphemisms amongwhich I count health care professional  a definition forwhichtoo long to repeat hereappears in this bookunder professional   Part of it excluding the awkwardpronoun of reference is pertinentSome individuals may call themselves professionalwith little or no training  For example thereare no minimum requirements to be a nutritionistso anyone can call him or herself one                        During a recent hospital stay my first I learned thatthe person who mops the floor is referred to as ahealth professional along with what I would havecalled the medical orderly who has the responsibilityfor taking blood samples the registered nurse in attendancethe head floor or ward nurse and the variousdoctors  Having been the editor in chief ofMosbys Medical and Nursing Dictionary first editionit occurred to me that I too might be termeda health care professional so too perhaps mightan inveterate hypochondriac            This book can do nothing of course to relieve usof the sort of vocabulary that makes a garbage man ordustman into a waste removal consultant but it isenormously helpful in explaining in a straightforwardway and unfortunately without rancor what bureaucracyhas bequeathed us  Evidently the GP nolonger exists having been replaced by the familypractice practitioner now considered a medical specialtyNaturally family practice is referred to asFPwhat else  why not FamPracfor whichHealth Care Terms offers the following definitionThe specialty of medicine which deals with providingsupervising and coordinating the continuinggeneral medical care of patients of all ages primarilyin family groups  The care provided is primary careOne of the medical specialties for which residencyprograms have been approved by the AccreditationCouncil for Graduate Medical Education ACGMESee specialty                        I suppose that means that as an aging divorc wholives alone I am only marginally entitled to treatmentfor a single individual can scarcely be considered afamily group  This specialty reminds me of a timesome decades ago when my doctor advised me indignantlythat he was not a GP gesturing to aframed certificate hanging on the wall of his office hetold me in no uncertain terms that he was an internistto which I replied that I should thereafterrequire only two doctors an internist and a dermatologistHe didnt see the humor of that remark            If ones field touches on the medical professioninsurance or any other area concerned with the bureaucracywhich I am always tempted to spell bureaucrazythis is an essential aid in unraveling andclarifyinginsofar as is possiblethe verbiage thatassails one from all sides  Although the average victimof the medical bureaucracy need not have this as avademecum public private and especially hospitallibrarians should note its great value as an adjunct tothe other reference books available none of whichcovers the same territory  Three appendices roundout the usefulness of this work            It would be only fair to mention that the terminologyis that used in the United States            Laurence Urdang                              Ship to Shore            My aim in this work is to illustrate what I believe isthe astonishing debt that our idiomatic speech owesto the nautical language of the past  English is extraordinarilyrich in metaphor and it is the intention ofthis book to show that many of the figures of speechthat we use from day to day derive from the languageand customs of the sea            From the Preface            Peter D Jeans is an Australian who writes a columnin The West Australian on the origin of wordsThis is a substantial useful interesting work but if thereaderuser is seeking an authoritative documentedarchive of nautical expressions he may be disappointedAs readers of VERBATIM are aware we giveshort shrift to the trappings of academia in our pageswe eschew footnotes with rare exceptions as well asbibliographies  But in reviewing the works of othersattention must be paid to such materials and theBibliography of Selected Sources and DictionariesConsulted include only twentyfive titles under theformer category plus fifteen of Patrick OBrians JackAubrey novels and only ten under the latter some ofwhich are curious choices indeed Robert HuntersUniversal Dictionary of the English Language NewYork Collier  which I have never heard of EricPartridges Origins A Short Etymological Dictionaryof Modern English contains a great many errors andought to be avoided by serious researchers the authorevidently chose not to wade through Johnsons Dictionaryrelying instead on McAdam and Milnes AModern Selection                        Still it is unfair to judge a book by its peripheralsBefore getting to the content let us look at the appendicesof which there are four  The first NauticalPrepositions includes aback abeam about aboxacockbill adrift and other words that are adverbsnot prepositions along with ahoy and a few othersbeginning with a  evidently the author believes thatmany nautical words beginning with a are prepositionswhich is simply not the case  Appendix  containsChanged Spellings and Corrupted Word Formsalthough the information given here is accurate as faras I could tell it is confusing to have some wordslisted under their original spelling studding sailtreenail and others in their corrupted form gunnelbosun and what happened to trunnel  I fear thatthere is a great deal more to the question of spellingand pronunciation than has been allowed for            Appendix  Nautical Terms Related to HumanAnatomy shows nauticalisms that were borrowedfrom anatomical terms not the other way round  Thecoverage is a bit loose but no one is likely to considerearring an anatomical term and forelock asmall iron wedge of pin driven through a hole or slotat the end of a sheavepin to prevent it from workingout contains a  lock from a door not from a foreheadwhich has a different etymological origin            Nautical Terms Derived from the Land Appendix is divided into the sublistings DomesticEnvironment and General Environment  The suitabilityfor such treatment varies bosuns chair is listedsimply because it is a chair cap is listed presumablybecause it is thought to refer to an item of apparelBut a chair is virtually anything for an individual to siton and cap etymologically at least originally meantcape with a hood or so the OED has it  Withoutdated citations for the earliest occurrences of thesewords in a nautical context how is one to know if theywere derived from the Land or merely coincidentalwith them            Still no serious harm  Let us now turn to themain body of the work  Opening it at random wefind appropriately enoughHogwash Sailors slang for nonsense rubbish a talewith no truth in it and worthless stuffHis claim that he is an experiencedmotor mechanic is all hogwash                        Aside from the unfortunate quotation which hardlyseems nautical at all hogwash is ordinary Englishwhich it may be assumed Englishspeaking sailorsused as a medium in which to couch their nauticalismsThus the direction would seem to have beenfrom everyday word to language of the sea and notas advertised vice versa  The same must be said forhitch go without a hitch get hitched hoist hold offhold on  and scores of other entries these were everydaywords in the general language before they wereused by sailors  The problemand it is a serious oneis that there are indeed many words and phrases thatoriginated at sea and were brought ashore for readyembodiment in everyday speech but to find the sameterms in both does not justify the assertion that the seaterm came first            It must be saidand I believe I shall be borne outon thisthat relying on citations appearing in theOED or in works written long ago is a precarious businessthe only accurate safe statement that can bemade about such information is that it provides evidencefor the existence of a word in a given context atthe time of publication of the work it cannot and mustnot be construed as the first time the word appearedon the face of the earth merely as the first writtenevidence we have of its appearance  Clearly that is notto say that most words appearing in quotations in theOED and in any other original source are being usedfor the first time on the contrary it is very likelyandthis might well apply to terms of art of a specializedfield and particularly the speech of sailors who didnot enjoy an entirely savory reputationthat the termswere in oral use for a long time before they were writtendown  Consider how long it took lexicographers toinclude fourletter words in their dictionaries yet weknow from long experience with spoken English thata researcher five hundred years hence would be wrongto conclude that those terms were invented or evencame into general use at the end of the th centuryAnd still not all are listed            A problem arises when those who would swallowdictionaries whole are left to conclude that their contentis sacrosanct  Those who try to apply a scientificapproach to the assessment of data become rapidlyaware that what we are examining is not likely to becompletewhich is certainly true when dealing withlanguageor even accurate as the alchemists andother early researchers in science discovered            There is a certain charm seen in working thealchemy of language and we can well appreciate it inthe context of artistic license  But it is quite anotherthing when it is foisted on an unsuspecting public asfact when indeed it is either pure speculation or awriters interpretation of the best way to make data fitinto the procrustean bed of his theory            There is no doubt that much controversy has surroundedthe interpretation of the word devil in nauticalcontexts and particularly with the expressionbetween the devil and the deep blue sea  Likewise itis indisputable that many nautical expressions havecome ashore to be used metaphorically by landlubbersThe problem is that although many such expressionshave been included in Ship to Shore manythat were not nautical have also been listed  As it isimpossible for the nonexpert to sort them out it remainsfor people like Jeans to do so and he has incautiouslyincluded many for which insufficientevidence exists that they were originally nautical andhe has failed in his duty by not identifying questionableentries            Shardlows drawings are a model of clarity andcharacter                              NineteenthCentury English            It is always a good idea to read an authors prefaceor foreword to discover the purpose of a bookbefore reading and certainly before reviewing itFrom Professor Baileys we quote the followingwhich pretty much sums up his attitude toward languagein general and English in particularEnglish is a single language full of variety and I believethat no speaker is beneath notice and no singleone has exclusive rights to represent the languageModels assuming metropolis and hinterland capitaland colony standard language and dialect have littleto offer except fragmentation and prejudice                        It is virtually impossible to argue against such a pointof departure from the standpoint of the linguistic scientificinvestigator  After all researchers into cancerheart disease virology and bacteriology would lookquite foolish were they to adopt the high moralground by damning the causes of disease as sinful orbad  Yet the issue of good vs bad is always atthe forefront when language comes up for discussionnot perhaps among linguists but to be sure amongthe rest of the population  In some cases murdermayhem and to borrow a tasteless euphemism fromsocial conflict linguistic cleansing have beenaroused by languagenot by vituperation cursingand blasphemy but simply by being in the wrongplace at the wrong time speaking a particular languageor dialect  Dialect differences can cause strifeand disharmony as can be witnessed in the contemporarydispute over the decision by a California schooldistrict to use Ebonics as a vehicle to teachStandard English            Linguists might well distance themselves fromsuch mundane antiintellectualism but that does notmake it go away nor does it solve the problem orcome close to answering the question of what shouldbe done about teaching language  A very telling pointin such disputes is that those who speak a dialectother than Standard which we persist in putting inquotation marks because it continually changes bothtemporally and geographically are condemned to acceptwork that is below a level socially and economicallyto which they aspire and to which they feel theyare entitled at least from the standpoint of opportunity            As I have held while language itself can the subjectof cool analysis in some contexts it is a social institutionand our means of communication  While itis not only scientific and scholarly but noble to maintainthat such matters as pronunciation usage dialectand other features are all part of the descriptionof language and are neither good nor bad the factremains that using a dialect or speech pattern that isunacceptable to those who are giving out the jobs maymean that one either gets the job or not other qualificationsbeing equal hence the scientific andscholarly considerations may be effectively put intotheir academic niches where they belong            There is another aspect to the entire subject invariablyignored by linguists and linguistic scientistsbecause they remain unable to measure or quantify itnamely style  Language is language says the scientisttotally ignoring sometimes deliberately usually owingto lack of discernment any artor lack thereofthatmight be involved in the speech or writing of individualswhether professional writers or not  Somemight protest that the study called stylistics deals withart in language but those who know the nature ofstylistics are aware that it does not even come close tomeasuring effectiveness poetry eloquence beautyand other characteristics associated with artistic expression            Third the language of an individual reflects hisculture which is a catchall term covering manythings  There are those of an older generation thatconsiders itself better educated than almost anyoneyounger who understand culture to mean familiaritywith the better and more important works of art of allkinds of the world  This interpretation of culture isadmittedly of decreasing importance to an increasingproportion of the population who place rock n rollstars on the same scale of artistic accomplishment asMilton Rembrandt Mozart Gershwin Hemingwayet al because the last do not speak to them theyare peremptorily shouldered out of considerationThis aspect of language should not be construed solelyas a demonstration of knowledge as in knowing howmany symphonies Beethoven wrote whether Carusowas a tenor or a bass or being able to hum melodiesfrom Puccinis operas though that is certainly a reflexof a cultured individual  Rather it is the artistry thatrubs off on the person steeped in the best parts ofthe culture the phrase unconsciously plucked from athcentury poem or thcentury play no matterhow corny like Methinks the lady doth protest toomuch the single word that indicates at least passingfamiliarity with history like defenestration  the fragmentof an air associated with a Bach fugue            These aspects of language are social philosophicalartistic largely ignored by linguists sometimesout of devotion to what is perceived as the scientificmethod sometimes out of sheer philistinism and theinability to exercise taste sometimes out of abject ignoranceOne need only read the academic paperspublished in linguistic journals to be convinced thatnotwithstanding their specialty linguists at large areincapable of writing simple expository declarativesentences without resorting to turgid syntax obscurevocabulary and uncompromising sesquipedalianismIn short considering that their specialty is languageit is astonishing how few of them use it effectively            In this regard I am pleased to say that RichardBailey is an exception  Though a linguistand a goodonehe knows how to write and how to write persuasivelyand informatively  Most of the precedingcommentary has nothing whatsoever to do with thesubstance of NineteenthCentury English whichtraces the spread growth and increasing universalityof the English language during that period  Bailey examinesthe Writing Sounds Words Slang Grammarand Voices of English to quote the chapter headingsand he does so without expressing much opinionabout them letting the facts speak for themselvesWell almost  Baileys presentation is tinged by anunderlying suggestion of disapproval of those whowould dictate the way the language should be usedHe does not say as much expressly but his characterizationof such dogooders as pedants p  andpurists p  his persistent placing of quotationmarks around words and phrases condemned by contemporarypurists and pedants to signifywhattheir quaintness  their curiosity            For the most part despite the occasional campaigningfor linguistic liberalism aimed obviously atth and presumably stcentury readers whatemerges is an engaging picture of concerned speakersof English some of them pedants trying to establishor preserve some purity in the language the remainderreaders of the works published by the formerin the shape of grammars usage guides pronunciationguides spellers etc  Because English spelling is oftenunrelated to its pronunciation and inconsistent with itthe majority of spellers were used as teaching tools inschools but there was also an opportunity to acquaintadults with accepted spelling forms just as there istoday among the bad spellers dictionaries            There is no gainsaying that standardization ofspelling and of other mechanics of language can behelpful to communication but like other reflexes oflanguage proficiency it can also mark the relative literacyor education of a person  Spelling and conventionalhyphenation can be linked while I noted notso much as a single typographical error in this book Isaw once again confirmation of the encroaching ignoranceof those who write automatic hyphenation programsfor computers presumably employed in theproduction of the work the oftrepeated word Englishproperly hyphenated English has been made toconform to the other words having ng at a syllablebreak by appearing as English throughout  Thisrule is well known to traditional compositors thoughcuriously it does not extend to Angle or Anglo as inAngloSaxon  though they are all linked etymologicallyThe same point was raised in our reviewXIX   of Baileys Images of English  alsoUniversity of Michigan Press            In his assessment of the century as a wholeBailey discusses the progress of education especiallypublic education and the spread of literacy  In thatregard a point to be made about the culture of theperiod in contrast to the language is the publicationlate in the century of a number of reference booksespecially readers handbooks and particularly A Dictionaryof Phrase and Fable by E Cobham Brewerwhich went through many printings and revived inthe latter part of the th century through several updatededitions  It is significant because its enormouspopularity reflects the publics interest in metaphorbased on classical and cultural references understandableonly to those steeped in the literature notto those who having learned to read seldom readanything but a dime novel a popular magazines or anewspaper  Those who aspired to broader knowledgeused Brewers and others books as a readyreferenceguide to culture  It is not insignificant that their popularityhas seen a reflowering a hundred years aftertheir original appearance late in the th century                           NineteenthCentury English is an interesting ifsomewhat staid tracing of the development of Englishinto a world language though its influence today isprobably owing directly more to events of the pastsixty years than to the growth and spread it enjoyedduring the century of colonialism  Still there is nogainsaying Baileys ultimate argumentNineteenthcentury English was part of a socialtransformation that changed the language andchanged the world                        It remains to be seen what will be written about theth century the close of which is seeing a spread ofEnglish via the Internet that is regarded as so perniciousby the French that they have seen fit to prosecutea company with a pied  terre in France foradvertising on the medium in English without the accompanimentof a French translation  Will the stcentury see still more diversification of English andencouragement of that

and Dialects            Note The publisher originally sent only the cassetteand that is what is reviewed here            This hourlong tape recording employing the casualformat of the candid microphone offers thirteendiverse English speech patterns gleaned from asmany off the cuff interviews            Because no other information accompanied thetape this reviewer was forced to depend on the morethan slightly helterskelter impression it leaves on thechartless listener            The quality of the tape itself is often fuzzy nomatter that the interviews appear to be unrehearsedThe table of contents on the sleeve omits the Dublinsegment even though the speaker is very muchthere in his recollections of the  uprisingLloyd George the Black and Tan as well as bits andpieces of his own lifes history            The interviews are preceded by a set of drillwordspresumably to establish the regional pronunciationof English vowel sounds which have over thecenturies undergone many striking changes  Not altogethersurprisingly the drillwords are almost withoutexception spoken with great clarity from Bristol toNorthumberland and Liverpool to Lowland ScotsBut once the polite obligation to enunciate thesesounds is got over the narrators are back on familiarground most of them buoyantly loquacious and quiteat home with the art of the monologue            Their stories range from a mirthful account by aBristol woman about her shiftless nextdoor neighborwhose overflowing drain gutters flooded her propertyto a somber story by a man from South Waleswhose sons leg was amputated in a fearful childhoodaccident            There is no high drama in these everyday storiesthey are simply abstract and brief chronicles of timeand place spoken artifacts for preserving the everfluctuatingaccents and dialects of Great Britains intricatelinguistic hierarchy            It should be noted however that these singularodds and ends of regional accents are far from beinguseful for an actor aspiring to become the next MerylStreep mistress of the virtual dialect  Although theyare indisputably accurate none of the excerpts is sufficientlyheightened to be a model for simulationespecially given the unfocused quality of the tape itself            In his  preface to Pygmalion George BernardShaw wrote It is impossible for an Englishman toopen his mouth without making another Englishmanhate or despise him  And in  John Honey anEnglish professor and phonetics expert wrote DoesAccent Matter  rev XVI in which he championsthe cause of teaching the Queens English RP or receivedpronunciation in order to achieve social andeconomic equality for those who are passed over in thejob market because of unacceptable regional accentssuch as the nasal twangs and glottal stops of CockeyLiverpudlian and Glaswegian            Both Pygmalion arguments are sound as well asaltruistic but at a time when certain civilizations andcultures are in danger of losing their spoken heritagethese slight quirky renderings of native speech mayprove to be as valuable as the archaeologists fossilfinds  Only this year the Ainu an indigenous peopleof the Japanese island of Hokkaido are strugglingvaliantly and often painfully to relearn their nativelanguage which almost died out over the past fiftyyears  An Ainu farmer speaks for the strange tenacioushold of ones mother tongue Its

missed the point on so muchFor example stress was not soothed by a cookie monsterwhich locked up your terminal and kept you fromworking until you provided a required responsewhose exact form was not necessarily known by thevictim to its demand for a cookie  Some of the definitionsare quite wrong  A flame is not distinguishedby its being illconsidered a flame is usually insultingor provocative in the sense of causing irritation itcan also be simply persisting incessantly and rabidlyon a topic others find uninteresting or past the pointof interest  Flames are not any more illconsideredthan all the rest of human communication unless youare of a particularly pacifist philosophy that deems allacrimony ill considered            If the reader doesnt know what a flag is definingit as a piece of information that is either true or falseis worse than not defining it at all  You can think of aflag as a marker associated with something else theflag can be one or zero on or off yes or no  Oneuse of a flag is to mark whether information currentlyin use in a computer application has been changedsince it was last saved  If yes the user is askedwhether it should be saved upon exit if no the programsimply exits  A flag is true or false only in thevery limited sense of asking the question Is it truethat the information on the screen is different from itscounterpart on the disk  It has nothing to do withthe correctness of the information and the flag itselfis presumably always true            Almost as misleading is the idea that real time isan amount of time such as the time it takes real peopleto communicate on a telephone real time as appliedto a computer system is actually a respectedtechnical term that describes using a computer forsomething that is happening while the program is runninglike the computers modification of the angles ofthe flaps of an airplane in flight based on the rate ofchange of the altimeter independent of commandsfrom the pilot  This term distinguishes such programsfrom the more common type for example calculatinga flight path based on weather predictions for uselater in the day  Real time in jargon applies to doingsomething without time for planning or previousthought as in the minutes before a presentation orindeed during it creating a display to replace thekey prop someone forgot  Other terms define a durationof time in the real world as opposed to theamount of computer processing time required forsomething  One such term is wall time from theclock on the wall            I do not claim to be a member of the society thatuses this language but I have traveled there andlearned a little from the natives  Nor are my definitionsof these terms intended to be rigorous                              I am delighted that Ruth Flanders has tried toshow the interesting imagery underlying French andGerman idioms Foreign Treasures XXIIUnfortunately she only browsed through the dictionaryand thus committed a number of deplorable inaccuraciesand infelicities            Ms Flanders lists b hmische Drfer andWortsalat as synonyms  These two words are howeverfar from interchangeable  Wortsalat means obscurephraseology and mysterious wording oftenreferring to pagelength sentences that can crop up inthe writing of bureaucrats and politicians  The phrasejemandem  fiir jemanden bhmische Drfer  ein bhmischesDorf sein could be translated as to appearincomprehensible inexplicable or strangeOriginally the phrase expressed the fact that toGermans living in Bohemia the Slav village namessounded strange and that the Germans could not understandthem precisely            Also Germans would never say or write Senfdazugeben  when they had in mind the meaning tomeddle in other peoples affairs  conversation byadding ones own piece of wisdom  In this case it isespecially important to add the possessive adjectivehence seinen Senf dazugeben   Otherwise it wouldbe assumed that you were talking about sausages andseasoning            The last German phrase in Ms Flanders articleein Gesicht wie  Regenwetter haben  is also notquite correct as Robert J Powers notes EPISTOLAXXII  It should be added however that fourfigures can be used in connection with the phrase einGesicht wie  Tage Regenwetter haben             In More Foreign Treasures XXIII dieffentliche Hand singular not plural denotes thestate and the

obviously hurt very much  Because offrequent and ironic use however the proverbchanged its denotation to the opposite in StandardGerman  The old meaning has meanwhile declinedin social status

DICTAXXII  The subject of our epistolary dialogue isthe etymology of the word balagan  a buzzword inmodern Hebrew            If in Mr Wilenitzs EPISTOLA he had writtenPerhaps instead of Surely  the vehicle for carryingthe Russian word into modern Israeli Hebrew wasYiddish I would agree with him without reservationBut recent experiences in San Francisco as well ascasual earlier observations in the New York area and inIsrael suggest to me that Russian is to the currentAshkenazic Diaspora what Yiddish was to earlierJewish communities in Europe and America            The analogy is not perfect analogies hardly everare  Unless Yiddish is merely a dialect of Germanand not a separate language spoken almost exclusivelyby Jews it differs from the Russian spoken by thebulk of Jewish emigrants from the USSR in being theJews own language rather than a shared language likeRussian  In the following anecdote substitution ofthe word Russian for Yiddish kills the joke though Iam sure that many more Jews today speak Russianthan speak YiddishAn old Jewish lady in Israel was chided by her childrenfor talking to their Sabra children in Yiddishthe dialect of the ghetto instead of in HebrewBut the old grandmother protested I talk tothem in Yiddish because I want them to knowtheyre Jewish                        Nevertheless Jewish immigrants to America andeven in Israel despite pressure to learn Hebrew communicateamong themselves mainly in Russian hardlyever in Yiddish  When Soviet Jews were allowed toemigrate and poured into New York the HOBOEPYCCKOE CJIOBO previously an antiCommunistRussianlanguage newspaper published in New Yorkbecame more Jewish than Christian in orientationrunning ads for Jewish funeral parlors and Jewishsummer camps  The best Soviet Jewish writers incontrast to Isaac Bashevis Singer from Poland wrotetheir masterpieces in Russian  I have in mind BabelYevgeniya Ginsburg and her halfJewish son Aksyonovthe poets Osip Mandelshtam and Joseph Brodsky andin my opinion the best novelist of World War II VasilyGrossman            Recently I accompanied my wife to San Franciscowhere she underwent a series of diagnostic testsat the UCSF Mount Zion Medical Center which Igathered was basically a Jewish institution  I was bemusedto notice that throughout the hospital therewere signs in Russian as well as English  I found myselfchatting with one of the nurses in Russian  Whilewaiting for my wife in the reception room I saw adapper little old fellow approach the information deskand attempt in Russian to get directions from the uncomprehendingwoman in attendance there behind asign in several languages including Tagalogbut notYiddish  I interpreted for the old gentleman and thenhaving nothing better to do walked with him to thebuilding he had been directed to  He was from KievI was once at a Jewish friends birthday party wheresomehow the guests mostly Jewish got to talkingabout their grandparents most of whom came fromKiev and thereabouts  One of the guests laughinghyperbolically remarked Well everyones grandmothercame from Kiev  Of course politically theUkraine or Ukraine tout court as it is now officiallycalled is no longer Russian but as for language it isat least as Russian as it is Ukrainian  So I guessedthat the old gentleman was Jewish and I would betthat he was fluent only in Russian            If indeed Russian is the principal language of thecurrent Jewish Diaspora balagan  at least in MiltonHorowitzs example where it applied to a computerscreen might have come directly from Russian intoHebrew without the intermediary of Yiddish  Or perhapsit was simply Russian in English transliterationrather than the Hebrew or Yiddish word borrowedfrom Russian
