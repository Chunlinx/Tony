                                  Edward W Said            The game of biographical gotcha is a perenniallypopular form of ideological blood sport The goal is to find an incriminatingdatum that will leave a permanent stain on the targets reputation make hisdefenders look like craven apologists and give the general public a readymadejudgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought If theanticommunism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you you can point torecent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist If youresent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I RigobertaMench  you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished someimportant details of her life story Didnt Karl Marx beat his wife And whatabout Freuds thing for his sisterinlaw and his taste for cocaine            To this list now addColumbia literature professor Edward W Said the subject of a fiercely debatedarticle in the September issue of Commentary  Thearticle by Americanborn Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner contendsthat Said who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in  hasover the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life andamplified others in order to create the impression that he was of all thingsPalestinian            Not so fast says Weiner Saids childhood was not theparable of Palestinian identity marked by dispossession from a belovedhomeland and the subsequent pain of exile Instead Said grew up not inJerusalem but in Cairo where his father an American citizen had moved as aneconomic expatriate approximately nine years before Edwards birth and hadbecome the owner of a thriving business and there until his own departure forthe United States as a teenager in  the young Edward Said resided inluxurious apartments attended private English schools and played tennis atthe exclusive Gezira Sporting Club as the child of one of its few Arabmembers            A similar account ofEdward Saids youth can be found in a new book called Out of Place  theauthor of which is Edward Said The book Saids  th  is awrenching intimate account of growing up in Cairos wealthy Levantineexpatriate community of summering in the dreary Lebanese resort town of Dhourel Shweir and of visiting the family home in Jerusalem sometimes for as longas several months Weiner claims that the memoir is an elaborate sleight ofhand and speculates that Said decided to spin the story of his pastbytelling the truth about itwhen he heard about Weiners inquiries In theweeks since his essay appeared Weiners motives methods and assertions havebeen roundly attacked by Said and his friends and Weiner has made some attemptat clarification Click for a recap of the controversy and links to relevantarticles or

research by a scholar in residence at theJerusalem Center for Public Affairs Followers of Middle East politics as wellas viewers of the NewsHour With Jim Lehrer  where Said often appearsknow him as an eloquent spokesman for the Palestinian cause Readers of TheNation know him as a formidable reviewer of opera and classical musicSeveral generations of graduate students in a number of disciplines know him asthe author of Orientalism  The  literary scholars who make up themembership of the Modern Language Associationminus one who resigned inprotest earlier this year over Saids electionknow him as Mr PresidentReaders of AlHayat  a Londonbased Arabiclanguage newspaper andAlAhram  a Cairo weekly know him as a regular commentator on politicsand culture Each of these identitiespolitical activist literary scholaruniversity professor public intellectualare in Saids case inordinatelycomplex in and of themselves The tensions between thembetween intellectualaesthetic and political impulses that are felt with enormous passion andexpressed with great vehemencemake Said an uncommonly interesting andendlessly controversial intellectual figure            Most controversialandmost misunderstoodhas been Saids involvement in Palestinian affairs He haspublished half a dozen books on the plight of the Palestinians includingThe Question of Palestine  After the Last Sky  andPeace and Its Discontents  a scathing critique of the Oslo peaceaccords which Said calls the Palestinian Versailles These writings hisrelationship with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and his many years of service inthe Palestine National Council the nowdefunct Palestinian parliament inexile from which he resigned in  after being diagnosed with leukemia haveinvited smears and misrepresentations A decade ago Commentary brandedhim The Professor of Terror New York magazine once called himArafats man in New York And he showed up last spring unnamed inThe                New Yorker s special Money issue as a welldressed Columbiadon rumored to be on the payroll of the PLO            Until very recently Said has been an insistent voice forPalestinian statehood He helped to draft the PLOs Algiers Declaration of which linked this aspiration to the recognition of Israels right toexist Over the years he has often said that his own place in such a statewould be as its toughest critic Even as he has been unsparing in hisindictments of Israeli and American policy he has not let Arab governmentsorthe Palestinian leadershipoff the hook He has assailed the corruptauthoritarian regimes that rule most of the Arab world punctured theideological phantasms of PanArabist nationalism and reactionary Islam alikeand bemoaned the impoverished state of Arab cultural and intellectual life Hehas also within the Palestinian camp been a consistent advocate ofreconciliation with Israel and an opponent of terrorism The Question ofPalestine called for a twostate solution at a time when the official PLOambition was total control over British Mandatory Palestine The bookpublished in Israel in  had as of the mids never been translatedinto Arabic or published in any Arab country            In  in the wake ofthe Camp David accords Said delivered a message from Secretary of State CyrusVance to one of Arafats top aides indicating that the United States wouldrecognize the PLO as a legitimate party to peace talks in exchange forrecognition of Israel Arafat ignored the message Fifteen years later whenArafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White Houselawn Said who had been invited to the event by its patron Bill Clintonstayed home Since then as bienpensant American opinion has embracedthe peace process Said has bemoaned Arafats capitulation and grownincreasingly disgusted with the chairmans dictatorial rule over a few scrapsof occupied territory and with Israels continued expropriation of Palestinianlands In the New York Times Magazine last spring he wrote that thePalestinian state toward which the peace process seemed however pokily to betending could not provide democracy and justice for the Palestinians Insteadhe called for a single binational state based on a constitution somethingneither Israel nor the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority currentlyhas with the idea and practice of citizenship not of ethnic or racialcommunity as the main vehicle for coexistence            But to treat Said solely or even primarily as a politicalfigure is necessarily to produce a distorted view of his life He is first andforemost a literary critic who wrote his PhD at Harvardon Joseph Conrada lifelong obsessionunder Harry Levin one of the champions of a comparativeapproach to literary study Saids subsequent work has retained much of theexpansive spirit and rigorous methodology of Levins teachings BeginningsIntention and Method  the book which made Saids academic reputation is abulky study of how novels begin carried out through painstakingly close formalanalysis and displaying crushing erudition            But Saids fame outsidethe American academy rests on Orientalism  his sweeping account of howWestern art literature and scholarship have produced a deformed biasedpicture of Arab and Muslim culture in the service of colonial domination Theimpact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject vast though that was Inaddition to laying the groundwork for postcolonial studies as an area ofinquiry the book inspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to the othertogroups of people who by virtue of race gender sexuality or geographicallocation are unable to represent themselves and so to echo the line from KarlMarx that serves as the books epigraph must be represented by those morepowerful And Orientalism  with its harsh critiques of Europeanphilology and American social science contributed to an epistemological shiftin the American academy Traditional disciplines were no longer to be taken forgranted as the vehicles of objective knowledge but themselves became theobjects of ideological analysis            Both Saids methods and his substantive claims have comeunder attack Because his theoretical debt to Michel Foucault and hisunabashedly political intentions marked him as an avatar of the emergingacademic left a lot of the criticism came from traditional scholars In theNew York Review of Books  for example the Princeton historian BernardLewis one of the chief modern villains of Orientalism  decried Saidsinflammatory tone and questioned his knowledge of history philology andArabic To read Lewis piece click here For Saids angry response click here But the most sustained assault on Orientalism spremises and on its prestige came from the left In a book called InTheory a wholesale slaughter of the sacred cows of the postmodern Westernintelligentsiathe Indian Marxist literary critic Aijaz Ahmad raised furtherquestions about Saids mastery of his sources and accused him ofselfaggrandizement and insufficient political discipline Whereas Lewisattacks Said for trashing the norms and values of traditional scholarshipAhmad rebukes him for hewing too closely to them And while Lewis believes Saidto be motivated by a crude antiWestern leftist animus Ahmad finds himaltogether too enamored of the canons of European literature and avers thatSaid possesses a very conservative mind essentially Tory in itsstructure            Lewis and Ahmad are bothright Orientalism and its even more ambitious sequel Culture andImperialism are works of passionate almost agonized ambivalence To readthem is to encounter a mind at war with itself and the world and ready to goto war with his critics as any number of exchanges over the pastquartercentury will show Saids evident love of the literature and music ofthe West continually collides with his righteous anger at what the West hasdone to the rest His desire to use literary criticism as a weapon on the sideof the oppressed sits athwart the pleasure he takes in letting his mind playover the meaning in a novel or a poem The results are books at once exhaustingin their detail and maddening in their omissions uneven in tone overreachingand underargued He is easily distracted the critic John Leonard remarked inan appreciative review of Culture and Imperialism  answering too manyfire alarms sometimes to pour on more petrol            O rientalism and Culture and Imperialism areunquestionably incendiary but they are also permanent and exemplary works oflate th century criticism in no small part because they invite somuch argument because for all the intellectual authority they project theyremain open vulnerable provisional And they also fulfill the basic mandateof literary analysis which is to illuminate the works they discuss To returnto Verdis Aida  Conrads Heart of Darkness  or KiplingsKim after reading Said on them is to find them richer stranger andmore complicated than you had ever imagined            More than anyone else in his generation EdwardSaid has sought to embody an unfashionable perhaps obsolescent idea of theintellectualimmersed in culture and committed to politics placing criticismover solidarity speaking truth to power and steering clear of gods thatfail There was a time when this idea flourished more widelyeven in the pagesof Commentary
