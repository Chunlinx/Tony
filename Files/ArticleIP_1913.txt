                                 Downsizing Downsizing            The Clinton administrationisnt particularly mendacious on economic mattersin fact economic analysisand reporting under Clinton have been unusually scrupulous But the presidenthas changed his mind about economic policy so often that now his officialssound insincere even when they speak the plain truth            And so Ifeel a bit sorry for Joseph Stiglitz the eminent economist who chairsClintons Council of Economic Advisers In April Stiglitz released a report onthe state of the American worker more or less confirming what most independenteconomists had already concluded Workers are not doing as badly as recentheadlines might suggest In particular the impact of corporate downsizing hasbeen greatly exaggerated            Stiglitzs report was to all appearances a sincereattempt to produce a realistic picture of the American labor market Yet it wastreated by nearly all commentators as a purely political documentanelectionyear effort to accentuate the positive            But thecommentators had reason for their skepticism After all other members of theadministrationespecially Labor Secretary Robert Reichhave been insistentlypushing a very different view In the world according to Reich even wellpaidAmerican workers have now joined the anxious classes They are liable any dayto find themselves downsized out of the middle class And even if they keeptheir jobs the fear of being fired has forced them to accept stagnant ordeclining wages while productivity and profits soar            Like much of what Reich says this story isclear compelling brilliantly packaged and mostly wrong Stiglitz bycontrast is telling the complicated truth rather than an emotionallysatisfying fiction            To understand why Reich iswrong about this and most other things think about the strange case of themissing children During the early s sensationalist journalism combiningtruecrime stories with garbled statistics convinced much of the public thatAmerica is a nation where vast numbers of children are snatched from theirhappy families by mysterious strangers every year TV shows about strangerabductions are a media staple to this day In reality however such crimesare rare about  per year in a nation of  million            Its notthat abductions never happen They do and they are terrible things Nor is thepoint that the kids are all right For hundreds of thousands of Americanchildren life is sheer hell Almost always however the people who victimizechildren are not strangers For every child kidnapped by a stranger at least athousand are sexually abused by family members But stranger abductions madegood copy and therefore became a public concern out of all proportion to theirreal importance            Corporate downsizing is neither as terrible nor as rare asstranger abduction but the two phenomena share some characteristics Likestranger abductions downsizing is a cameraready tragedy perfect for mediaexploitation that is only a minor part of the real problem            Stiglitzs report is full ofdense statistical analysis making this point but heres a quick doityourselfversion A February Newsweek cover story entitled Corporate Killerslisted just about every large layoff by a major corporation over the last fiveyears The number of jobs eliminated by each company appeared in large typenext to a photo of the CEO responsible The article implied that it wasdescribing a national catastrophe But if you add up all the numbers the totalcomes to  That is less than one worker in a tiny blip in thenumber of workers who lose or change jobs every year even in the healthiesteconomy And the great majority of downsized workers do find new jobs Althoughmost end up making less in their new jobs than they did before only a fractionexperience the muchpublicized plunge from comfortable middle class to workingpoor No wonder Stiglitz found that the destruction of good jobs by greedycorporations is just not an important part of what is happening to the Americanworker            The pointis that Reichs style of economicswhich relies on anecdotes rather thanstatistics slogans rather than serious analysiscannot do justice to thediversity and sheer size of this vast nation In America anything that canhappen does Strangers kidnap children mathematicians become terroristsexecutives find themselves flipping hamburgers The important question is notwhether these stories are true it is whether they are typical How do they fitinto the big picture            Well the big picture looks like this Both thenumber of good jobs and the pay that goes with those jobs are steadilyrising The workers who have the skill talent and luck to get these jobsgenerally do very well Only a relative handful of good job holders which isto say only a few hundred thousand a year experience serious reversesAmericas middle class may be anxious but objectively it is doing fine            The people who are reallydoing badly are those who do not have good jobs and never did Those with lousyjobs have seen their alreadylow wages slowly but steadily sink In otherwords the main victims of to use another of Reichs phrases the neweconomy are not the few thousand managers who have become hamburger flippersbut the tens of millions of hamburger flippers janitors and so on whose realwages have been declining or  percent per year for the last two decades            Does this distinctionmatter It does if you are trying to set any sort of policy priorities Shouldwe as some in the administration want focus our attention on preserving thejobs of wellpaid employees at big corporations Should we pressure thosecompanies to stop announcing layoffs Should we use the tax system to penalizecompanies that fire workers and reward those that do not Or instead shouldwe fight tooth and nail to preserve and extend programs like the Earned IncomeTax Credit that help the working poor It is disingenuous to say we should doboth Money is scarce and so is political capital If we focus on smallproblems that make headlines we will ignore bigger problems that dont            So lets give Joe Stiglitzsome credit No doubt his political masters allowed him to downsize the issueof downsizing at least partly because they believed that good news reelectspresidents Sometimes however an economic analysis that is politicallyconvenient also happens to be the honest truth
