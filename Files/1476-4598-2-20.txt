                    Background        Malignant tumor cells frequently show deregulation and        hyperactivation of signalling pathways one of which is        represented by the TGF signal transduction pathway            TGF has been shown to potently inhibit proliferation of        most epithelial endothelial and hematopoietic cells            However during tumor progression malignant cells may        become refractory to TGFmediated cell cycle arrest In        later stages of tumorigenesis TGF can act as a stimulator        of invasion and metastasis    acting directly on the        tumor cells or inducing angiogenesis and facilitating local        and systemic immunosuppression respectively     For        example TGF may stimulate the expression of proteases        such as uPA MMP or MMP enzymes frequently        overexpressed in invasive tumor cells             TGF signals through a heteromeric receptor complex of        type II and type I receptor serinethreonine kinases which        activates the downstream Smad signal transduction pathway            After TGF binding to the receptor complex the TGF        type II receptor kinase phosphorylates TGF type I receptor        which inititates the downstream response by phosphorylating        receptorregulated Smads RSmads such as Smad and        Smad By forming a multimeric complex with the CoSmad        Smad activated RSmads translocate to the nucleus and        induce transcriptional modulation of target genes                   Breast cancer cells frequently metastasize to bone        causing bone destruction and hypercalcemia            Parathyroid hormonerelated protein PTHrP secreted by        these cells is a major mediator of the osteolytic process            Osteolysis leads to the release of TGF which in        turn further induces PTHrP expression     Other        tumorrelevant genes such as         pai or         upa  can also be activated by        TGF        Hence downregulation of TGF mediated gene expression        may counteract malignancy of cancer cells In this study        we investigated whether two small molecules SB and        SB could be used to downmodulate TGFinduced        transcriptional activation of TGF target genes In the        past these compounds have been widely used as specific p        inhibitors    and their inhibitory action has been well        documented       However recent results show        that in a comparable concentration range they inhibit the        serinethreonine kinase activity of TGF type I receptor        preventing phosphorylation of RSmads              Here we show that in the highly invasive breast cancer        cell line MDAMB the SB and SB        inhibitors negatively altered Smad nuclear entry upon TGF        stimulation This resulted in a reduced response of        TGFinducible genes to TGF The degree of inhibition        varied tremendously depending on the particular gene        analyzed                    Results                  SB and SB downregulate transcription          from TGFresponsive genes          Plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI and PTHrP          are known target genes of TGF signalling We have          previously demonstrated that TGF upregulates PTHrP and          PAI RNA levels in MDAMB cells     TGF          affected PTHrP expression primarily by increasing the          level of the promoter Pspecific transcript              Quantitative PCR analysis using primers allowing the          detection of PTHrP P and PAI transcripts indicated          that incubation of MDAMB cells with SB and          SB greatly inhibited TGFinduced increase in          PTHrP and to a lesser extent PAI mRNA levels Fig          AB          Next we examined whether inhibitory effects of these          compounds can also be seen on the PAI promoter in          transient transfection assays By using TPLuc as a          reporter plasmid we observed that TGF increased the          activity of TPLuc by approximately fold Fig          CD Preincubation with the SB inhibitors reduced this          activation almost to basal levels          These data suggest that SB and SB          inhibit TGFstimulated gene expression at least in part          by downregulating transcription                          SB and SB deregulate TGFinduced          Smad nuclear accumulation          It has recently been shown that SB and          SB are able to inhibit TGFinduced          phosphorylation of Smad by the TGFreceptor I kinase          ALK and to interfere with nuclear localization of          Smad     Nuclear translocation of Smad results          directly from TGFinduced Smad phosphorylation and is          therefore a measure of the activation status of ALK We          wanted to know to what extent SB and SB          interfere with TGFdependent Smad nuclear import in the          invasive MDAMB breast cancer cell line We prepared          nuclear and whole cell extracts from cells treated with          TGF with or without preincubation of one of the SB          inhibitors and analyzed those extracts for reactivity to          a Smadspecific antibody by Western blot analysis          This antibody primarily interacts with Smad but to          some extent it is also able to recognize Smad Based on          Northern blot hybridization data Smad but not Smad          is expressed in MDAMB cells     Hence the data          presented in Fig show the abundance of Smad in the          nuclear and in the whole cell extracts We found that          preincubation of cells with either SB or SB          decreased the level of nuclear Smad in the presence of          TGF Fig A whereas the total Smad protein level as          assayed in whole cell extracts was not altered          Next we studied the timecourse of TGFinduced Smad          nuclear entry in the presence or absence of SB          MDAMB cells were stimulated with TGF and harvested          after various time points Nuclear extracts were prepared          and subjected to Western blotting analysis using an          antiSmad antibody Stimulation of the cells with TGF          led to a rapid increase in nuclear Smad protein within           minutes and this level remained constant for  hours          Thereafter it started to decrease However pretreatment          of the cells with  M SB perturbed Smad nuclear          accumulation reducing the amount of Smad entering the          nucleus and shifting the peak level of nuclear Smad to a          later time point                          Other kinase inhibitors fail to inhibit TGF          mediated Smad nuclear entry          We next explored the possibility that the MEK          inhibitor PD and the Rhoassociated kinase inhibitor          Y might also interfere with Smad nuclear entry          However both agents failed to reproduce the effect of          the SB inhibitors as TGFinduced nuclear accumulation of          Smad was not affected by these inhibitors Fig C We          also used the protein kinase C PKC activator          phorbolmyristateacetate PMA Fig C which          appeared to enhance the amount of both basal and          TGFinduced nuclear Smad a phenomenon that has been          reported earlier                              TGF target genes respond differentially to          inhibition of Smad nuclear import          The delayed TGFmediated entry of Smad into the          nucleus in the presence of SB prompted us to          examine the effect of SB on TGFinduced gene          expression in a timecourse experiment We isolated total          RNA from the same cell suspension that was used to          prepare nuclear extracts for timecourse analysis in Fig          B cDNA was synthesized and subjected to quantitative          RTPCR in order to measure the transcript levels of          several TGF target genes The genes being examined were          divided into two groups I known TGF target genes           pai smad cmyc upa and          pthrp Fig ABCDE and II ets family genes                    ets ets and eseesx  Smad          was of particular interest as it belongs to the          inhibitory Smads which can counteract TGFinduced gene          activation     The response of the           smad gene to TGF is unusually          rapid    which is believed to stem from the peculiar          nature of the Smad promoter that contains a perfect          Smad binding site     Another inhibitory Smad          protein is Smad We have not analyzed the expression of          this protein since it preferentially inhibit bone          morphogenetic protein BMPinduced expression              In addition Smad shows varying effects on TGF          signalling     Nor were TGFresponsive genes such          as p studied that are involved in cell cycle          regulation Such genes are important targets at          earlystage carcinogenesis where TGF has a          tumorsuppressive rather than a tumorpromoting function              In addition eg p protein is not dectable in          MDAMB cells              Of group I           pai            pthrp and           upa mRNAs were induced upon TGF          treatment reaching maximum activation within three hours          As expected the           smad transcript was fully          upregulated much earlier after approximately  min The                    cmyc gene has been reported to be          unresponsive to TGF signal transduction in MDAMB          cells     We also measured the effect of TGF on           cmyc RNA and confirmed these          results as SB or control treatment failed to          significantly modulate           cmyc transcript levels The          inhibitory effect of SB showed remarkable          variation among the genes examined The rapid induction          of           smad mRNA was basically unaffected          by SB this could possibly explained by a lower          amout of Smad necessary to activate the Smad promoter          TGF induced           pai mRNA was reduced to          approximately  by the SB inhibitor whereas          TGFmediated expression of PTHrP and uPA was highly          sensitive to SB treatment SB downmodulated          expression of the latter genes to almost basal levels          Two           ets genes           ets and           ets  were also affected by TGF          and SB Group II Fig FG We observed that           ets and           ets transcript levels were          slightly upregulated when cells were incubated with TGF          and that this increase was partly inhibited by SB          The other           ets gene that we tested was           eseesx  a recently          characterized member of the           ets gene family originally          identified in epithelial cells     EseEsx has          been found to regulate the expression of TGF type II          receptor     We could show for the first time that          the level of the EseEsx transcript was strongly          downregulated in the presence of TGF The negative TGF          effect on EseEsx expression could not be inhibited by          SB                            Discussion        Evidence has been accumulated that TGF promotes        latestage tumorigenesis by stimulating angiogenesis and        invasive behaviour of tumor cells enhancing        immunosuppression and supporting epithelialmesenchymal        transition of cancer cells     Furthermore TGF is        believed to be part of a vicious circle in bone metastases        as it gets released from osteoclastdegraded bone substance        and subsequently stimulates PTHrP gene expression in nearby        metastatic cancer cells which in turn leads to an        activation of osteoclastic bone resorption            Therefore it is of great interest to understand in more        detail the molecular aspects of TGFmediated gene        expression in metastatic breast cancer cells and to explore        ways to interfere with this tumorigenic signalling        Here we report that two small molecules SB and        SB diminished TGFinduced expression of TGF        target genes which was accompanied by a perturbation of        TGFmediated Smad nuclear accumulation a crucial step in        TGF signal transduction Using SB we found that        not only was the total level of nuclear Smad in the        presence of TGF reduced but also that the nuclear entry        of Smad was delayed and less prolonged Interestingly        treating cells with TGF for  min yielded a similar        amount of Smad in the nucleus irrespective of whether        SB was present or not However when the time of        TGF treatment was reduced to  min or prolonged to  or         min SB had a tremendous effect on Smad        translocation to the nucleus The altered kinetic of        TGFdependent Smad nuclear entry as induced by SB        coincided with the efficacy by which this agent repressed        the activity of the different TGF target genes Fast TGF        responder genes such as         smad  whose maximum activation by        TGF was reached after  min was only slightly affected        by SB while slow responders such as         pai pthrp or         upa  that showed peak activation        after  min were very sensitive to the repressive        effect of SB The strongest effect of SB was        found on the TGFdependent expression of         pthrp and         upa  In these cases the inhibitor        completely eliminated responsiveness to TGF        How could these differential effect of SB on        TGFinduced gene expression be explained It is clear that        the         smad gene expression is regulated by        TGF in a Smaddependent manner    as it was found        for the         pthrp and the         pai gene      However the        Smad responsive elements are different The         smad gene contains a perfect        palindromic Smad binding element GTCTAGAC while the         pai and the         pthrp promoters harbor AGAC tandem        repeats     which binds Smad proteins less        efficiently     The         upa gene contains only an APbinding        site which resembles the Smadresponsive AGAC motif            A weaker binding site could require Smad to be present        at higher concentrations for efficient binding and would        make TGFdependent transcription from a gene more        vulnerable to reduced nuclear accumulation of the Smad        protein TGFinduced stabilization of the mRNA may also be        important for the sensitivity to SB TGF has been        shown also to stabilize the mRNA of the         smad gene     while        stabilization of RNA does not play a major role in        regulation of the         pthrp gene in MDAMB cells            In addition SB also inhibits p activity which        has been shown to play a role in TGF signalling                 Hence several factors could be responsible        for the differential sensitivity of TGFresponsive genes        to SB        Members of the Ets family of transcription factors share        a unique DNA binding domain the Ets domain and have been        shown to activate a large number of genes     and to        be involved in a number of physiological and        pathophysiological processes     There has been        accumulating evidence that Ets proteins play an important        part for the invasive program of cells particularly by        stimulating the expression of protease genes             Ets and Ets are overexpressed in a variety of tumors        including breast carcinomas     and references        therein Furthermore our previous work has shown that in        invasive breast cancer cells Ets proteins activate the        PTHrP P promoter in cooperation with Smad     In        this context it is interesting to note that TGF signalling        seemed to target the         ets and         ets gene Fig FG Analysis of        the human ets promoter sequence revealed that it contains        elements similar to TGFresponsive sites in other        promoters R Lindemann unpublished observation        We present data showing that TGF downregulated the        EseEsx transcript a novel and yet unpublished finding        EseEsx is a member of the Ets transcription factor        family and is expressed mainly in epithelial tissue            Its expression has been detected during mammary gland        development and breast tumorigenesis      It is        noteworthy that EseEsx is a potential transcriptional        regulator of the TGF type II receptor    and        overexpression of EseEsx in noninvasive cells leads to        a reduction in cell growth in the presence of TGF        presumably because of an increased TGF type II receptor        level     It is interesting that TGFdependent        downregulation of EseEsx is not affected by SB        It is possible that TGF does not require Smad or p to        inhibit EseEsxexpression Alternatively inhibitory        Smad whose expression was increased by TGF but not        affected by SB may be involved in this process One        way by which Smad can inhibit TGFdependent gene        expression is by blocking phosphorylation and hence        nuclear import of Smad and Smad     More recent data        showing that Smad is able to interact with histone        deacetylases suggest an additional role for Smad as a        transcriptional corepressor     Thus Smad might        interfere directly with EseEsx gene transcription        However TGF downregulated EseEsx mRNA levels faster        than it upregulated Smad expression excluding the        possibility that Smad mediates the TGF effect on        EseEsx at least at the initial phase Another candidate        that could be responsible for this process is cJun        Nterminal kinase JNK JNK has been described to drive        TGFdependent fibronectin synthesis independent of Smad        and p     In contrast to Smad JNK is activated by        the TGF receptor I in a way that does not require the        kinase domain     This supports the notion that        activation of Smad and JNK by TGF are independent events        It is remarkable that a constitutively active form of JNK        activator MKK and Smad are able to cooperatively        downregulate TGFresponsive promoters     It is quite        possible that a SmadJNK synergistic interaction is        involved in the TGFdependent downregulation of EseEsx        expression where JNK alone might mediate the initiation of        the TGFinduced repression                    Conclusions        We demonstrate that treatment of invasive MDAMB        breast cancer cells with SB and SB interferes        with TGFinduced Smad nuclear accumulation and that this        is paralleled by a differential transcriptional response of        TGF target genes Strikingly SB and SB        suppressed TGFdependent activation of those genes that        are important for the acquisition of invasive behavior        while having no effect on the expression of the natural        TGF inhibitor Smad This suggests that these compounds        may be useful to interfere with malignant behavior of        cancer cells Furthermore we show for the first time that        in breast cancer cells the EseEsx mRNA is downregulated        by TGF
