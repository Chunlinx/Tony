        is crime a problem in Arlington     uh actually we live out in Gainesville Virginia and uh my wife is originally from the Bronx       so for the longest time we didnt have any any kind of crime protection on our house at all because we lived way out in the country here   uhhuh   and uh then you know over the years we visited her folks and her folks have probably the most impressive crime reduction system ive ever seen on any house you know they have grates across every single window       they have probably three or four dead bolts on every door um just uh an amazing array of um you know sort of security measures on their house i mean its harder to get into their house than it is probably  a lot of minimum security prisons   well huh   so anyway now shes turning our house into sort of the same thing  we have uh we have like grates on the on the uh door on the basement windows even though theres very little crime in this area   huh well uhhuh   and we just had a a guy come out a locksmith come out and put all those on as well as sort of reinforce all of our dead bolts and uh put new locks in on some doors and fix our French doors up so that they were you know secure   yeah   so   yeah it its too bad you mentioned uh your inlaws place as as being like a prison in sense of hard to get into or out of or whatever   yeah   thats what crime is doing in the cities its turning those that live in the cities into prisoners   yeah whats it like in Dallas   uh actually im in a suburb of Dallas where its safer in general than it is in the big city   uhhuh   it um i think its like most cities and that is the high crime areas are the ones where theres more poverty   uhhuh   the you know that  theres always one part of town   right   uh whether its the Bronx or whether its a certain area in Dallas or whatever uh i i think thats where the crime is concentrated but gosh we just there was just one over in Fort Worth a woman was killed and her husband was uh badly injured   uhhuh   and theyve charged the uh the husbands daughter with hiring two of her teenage friends to kill her   oh man   dad and stuff yeah   man incredible   isnt that incredible and i mean uh that thats crime thats that you dont usually think about i mean you if you if youre going to carry on a conversation about crime you know you think of the hardened criminal that keeps uh attacking attacking again and again if you will whether you know depending on what his game is maybe its an armed robber who does it all the time but this is uh   yeah yeah yeah its clearly i i mean its theyre not in category of business criminals i mean theres theres criminals who are in it just because thats their business you know  i mean thats their trade essentially and   oh yeah yeah   you know then theres then theres the really random acts of violence we actually had a a woman who was very close to our house which sort of inspired my wife to you know beef up our own security measures here uh she was a couple of houses away and her husband travels a lot and is gone you know for weeks on end and she was upstairs with her uh child and heard somebody say hello hello from downstairs   uhhuh   so she immediately calls  and the Prince William County police come over and of course the woman kept her on the phone the whole time which i thought was a really good security measure because you know if you can get  Gainesville Virginia you know  youre probably you know i mean its probably a pretty effective thing you know     uhhuh   um so anyway the police showed up and they told her the person on the phone told her to run you know take the child and run downstairs and to let the police in because they were at her front door   uhhuh   and so she did that and when she opened the front door shed just bought this new German Shepherd puppy which had apparently you know uh gone all over the floor so the the policeman stepped into the front door and actually started sliding around on you know the dog mess   oh no     and she yelled simultaneously yelled look out which the policeman thought was like somebodys about to shoot me       so you know hes like spinning around in this stuff you know i mean its a pretty comical scene but anyway when the guy finally regained his balance you know he just like get out of house lady and stop trying to help me               but anyway later on its its gonna its uh she they didnt find anything i mean apparently you know if the guy came in he ran out and and the police tried to convince her that it was the dog playing with the remote control on the TV which just doesnt make any sense at all       too the odds of that are just really unlikely but i actually went over   hum   about a week later he was back home and she was on travel and he locked himself out and i went over and within i would say about five seconds got into their garage door   oh ho
