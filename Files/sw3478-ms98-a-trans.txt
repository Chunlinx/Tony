        okay       do you have anybody uh in your family that you ever had to put in a nursing home or   my grandmother uh is the only person so far and um i basically think for her you know it was it was the best thing she was pretty out of it by the time she went into the nursing home   okay was that here in Texas   no it was in Arizona im from Phoenix and so it was in uh  it was in Phoenix Arizona and uh that was hard but i it wasnt too hard a decision because there was sort of no other option by the time we put her in the nursing home   uhhuh right right did did you have to put her in yourself or   no i didnt my mother did uh she lived with well my aunt and my mother she lived with my aunt for a long time and then it got to where she was not manageable anymore she was   uhhuh   she didnt have Alzheimers but um she was pretty much out of it and you know so they finally had to do that how about you   understand understand that well my uh aunt that i kind of grew up with uh was in a nursing home she did have Alzheimers and we had to put her in the nursing home because of that but uh this was up in uh Milwaukee Wisconsin and uh   umhum   it was a situation thats probably as good as youre gonna get uh its associated with uh our church and uh   umhum   what they do my mother is in is a terrace which its called Luther Manor Terrace and uh these are condominiums you buy into   right   when you know whenever you know youre sixty or whatever you know whenever you want to buy into this thing and these are very nice condominium things and uh the idea is once you are in this program you are taken care of the rest of your life and they   umhum   they have a nursing home if you cant maintain your own apartment or your condominium uh you automatically go into that and from there they also have a health care area if you cant you know if you need more intensive care   umhum   and uh even the best there is isnt a nice situation with uh like you say when you get to a point where uh well she was ninety four and she was uh in the nursing home and the health care facility for i would guess about a years time but uh its a hard decision to make i tell you what its uh   well it is now was your aunt uh she was she no longer had her mental faculties is   thats that was really the price and that it gets very hard and on anybody uh id go up there and visit and and shed recognize me but as soon as i was out down the hall she didnt even know i was there   right umhum umhum   and uh its its sad you know it   well it is sad i think i dont think for me it would be as hard a decision if their minds were gone i think its a harder decision if theyre still if if their minds are still good but theyre completely  their bodies are gone you know i think that would be really hard to put someone in a nursing home in that situation um   yeah   you know i think theres some times when you theres just nothing else that can be done but i my uh my fathers dead and and so i just have my mother and shes in real good health but i would hate to have to make that decision for her um   well its its but whats really hard is the differences of care you know if you arent fortunate enough to have a situation like with my mother   you know i hope that that wont happen right   right now shes got terrible arthritis in her knees and its probably not real long where she wont be able to you know get along on her own and she probably   umhum umhum   you know hopefully it will be a number of years but shes seventy nine years old right now and now she understands that someday you know if she cant handle her apartment that uh you know shell have to go in the nursing home   umhum   but if you have situations where you dont have that kind you know its youre confronted with it and if you look at all the different nursing homes uh that are out there it it is kind of frightening some of these places uh its like put them in a cubbyhole and you know they dont theyre theyre more caretakers kind of its almost like putting a dog in a kennel you know some of these places and they stink and theyre it its a tough decision and you know if people dont have the resources for uh   right right   its i i dont know about in Arizona but around here i understand its its anywhere from about twenty three hundred to three thousand dollars a month in a a nursing home   im im sure thats probably true i i dont know anymore now my grandmothers was the same idea as what youre telling me she we when we put my grandmother in um she was in a room by her you know she had a roommate and but her her care wasnt completely hospital yet but uh and then she went into the hospital part so it was one of those progressive care   right   uh kinds of situations and it was also affiliated with our church so it was a really nice facility but it would be terrible if you had no funds and and had to put someone in a nursing home and not know what kind of care they were really getting   yeah   and of course its hard to know that unless youre there all the time um   well and thats the other thing that helps is that you have a relative a close relative thatll look in on them   umhum   even the best ones if you dont look in on them they have a tendency to just sedate people so they dont have to bothered you know and   right
