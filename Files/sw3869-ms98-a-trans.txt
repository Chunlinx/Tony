                obviously there have been a lot of changes in the roles of women over the past couple generations do you do you wanna speak first about your opinions about what those changes have been   okay um i think although there have been some im still of the opinion that were second rate citizens in most areas   yeah   uh i believe probably World War II is when you know the thing started that caused women to be more liberated because the men were at war and they needed women in the factories and things have never been the same   umhum umhum   as far as the as far as the job market women started working outside the home then but its taken a long time and i think weve got a long way to go   uh  well i agree with you there i feel that theres theres is a turning point ahead still ahead of us we havent gotten there yet   yeah i agree with that     excuse me but i do think that there is a greater awareness of the the benefits that the the feminine side of people offers you know as well as men you know when you   umhum right   when you see some of whats gone on in the self development areas um you know men trying to find their feminine side is is probably something that men uh   right   half a generation ago wouldnt have even considered as feasible   no no and then i think its a good turn i do see uh one of the reasons i also believe theres a lot to be ahead as i return to college and uh   umhum   i see girls of twenty or so they think there is no problem they dont realize the struggles just at the last few years   umhum   for them especially to go into professions that they couldve just been laughed at and it cant be done anymore at least legally it cant be done   yes thats true that is fairly recent   i think yes and i think just like today i mean it may be people that dont want you in a certain profession they cant state it where i dont think the change has come like from the mens side is they can still feel it   uhhuh   you know  i think   i feel i definitely feel that thats true in the political arena its gonna be a lot longer before women are in positions of authority authority on a on a majority basis you know theres always gonna be a a few but   yes yes   you know whereas in education and in health care women dominate because those are seen as supportive roles   right right   i think its interesting to just look at the history of women in history in in several cultures to to determine why in Western culture they take the role that they do because its its a matriarchial society in a lot of different parts of the world that that puts women in a much stronger position and yet  in the west its   umhum   just coming around to the point that we can recognize that the power that that a woman offers to the society you know in terms of nurturing as well as   yeah right yeah i wasnt aware of that either until uh just a year ago when i took a sociology course that even existed thats how indoctrinated i was   umhum umhum   but then im forty six i grew up with the generation of the guys my brothers went to college and im now struggling to no and it   thats exciting   wasnt important you know you go be a secretary or be a beautician   uhhuh uhhuh   that was my choice and uh but yeah i didnt even realize there were societies like you say where women were were important   uh still a lot of that influence yes yes and theres so much thats um inculturated we dont realize in the home how were how were influenced i think that even though my parents mightve said you know im im in an area uh health care where there are a lot of women obviously but my orientation was never toward being a physician it was toward being a health care provider in another area and   right   even though i heard from my my father it certainly go you know pursue as far as you can you can be a physician there was this under lying tone in our home because my mom did not work outside the home that it was also okay to not do that and so   right   its been a challenge to to cope with both of my orientations i i have a very nurturing side that would in some ways like not to work outside the home   right       well i find myself looking towards what im doing and im leaning towards education and thats still another area of women but thats what i wanna do you know have made i have made that decision that thats what i want to do even if it is the traditional thing its still what i wanna do and i know its like   umhum hum yes i think that over time we will recognize what our given rights our our given uh gifts are rather that that are different from men and and its okay that that there are some differences but that there are also a lot more areas that can overlap that that at this point dont i think girls are told that theyre probably not gonna be as good at math as as boys are and and they they   right yes im suffering suffering through that too yeah   they may be influenced by that in their school work   i was very seriously   i dont know if i was by my by the influence or whether i just am not very oriented in math as i am to other like verbal   well im not because i have been tested by the office
