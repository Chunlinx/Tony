                                 Kofi Annan            The office of UNsecretarygeneral is traditionally a refuge for knaves lickspittles andvillains in Kurt Waldheims case all three at once So Americans areentitled to surprise at Kofi Annans deft diplomacy in Iraq last week            US warmongers had warnedthat Annan would give away the store to appease Saddam Hussein But thesoftspoken secretarygeneral gave away nothing and got much His persistentpolite diplomacy revived weapons inspections which have eliminated far moreIraqi weapons than the war did calmed nerves throughout the Arab world andsaved the Clinton administration from an illconceived unpopular bombingplanall without an apparently meaningful concession to Iraq            More important Annanaccomplished all this in a way that brought glory to the United States Heannouncedemphaticallythat the negotiations would have been fruitlesswithout the US military threat The United States gains credit for diplomaticrestraint the United Nations gains credit for keeping the peace the will ofthe UN Security Council is enforced and the destruction of Iraqi weaponscontinues Even if Iraq reneges on the agreementwhich is likelythe UnitedStates has lost nothing but time There will be far more support for bombing ifHussein flouts Annan than there was when Hussein was simply floutingClinton            Kofi Annan is the perfectsecretarygeneral for an age of US triumphalism It used to be that the ColdWar stymied the United Nations Today the United States does It is dominant inpolitics economics culture To the rest of the world US foreign policy isWere Number Oneisman insufferable combination of gloating and bullyingThe United States has its own ill feelings toward the United NationsConservatives see the organization as a mob of meddlesome antiAmerican nagsplotting for world government In some Americans eyes the United Nationsprincipal accomplishment is collecting loose change during UNICEFstrickortreat fund drives Bob Dole got his biggest round of applause duringthe  presidential campaign when he mocked SecretaryGeneral BoutrosBoutrosGhalis name Sen Jesse Helms RNC threatened to stop all USfunding for the United Nations and many of Helms Republican colleagues inCongress have proposed US withdrawal            Since hetook over as secretarygeneral  months ago Annan has begun to do theimprobable restore Americas faith in the United Nations and the UnitedNations faith in America Annans United Nations has shelved BoutrosGhalisgrand ambitions Annan is building an organization we can live with one thatis smaller better run and more deferential to the United States            On paper Annan isnt a promising candidate to reunite theUnited States and the United Nations He is too attached to his organizationthe first secretarygeneral to rise from inside its bureaucracy This does notexactly recommend him to anyone outside that bureaucracy He has spenthis life as an international civil servant a phrase that conjures an imageof someone wasting millions of US dollars pushing paper around the ThirdWorld which is basically what he did            Born to apowerful family in Ghanahis father was a hereditary chiefAnnan attendedMinnesotas Macalester College in the late s on a Ford Foundation grant AsGhanas promising democracy collapsed into a dictatorship Annan like manybright young West Africans decided to remain overseas He went to work for theUnited Nations rising gradually through the ranks at the World HealthOrganization the High Commission on Refugees and the Secretariat Eventuallyhe supervised peacekeeping operations in Somalia and Bosnia In the Byzantinelanguorous UN bureaucracy Annan earned a reputation as someone who actuallyGot Things Done Thanks to his straightforward manner and overwhelming decencyhe was the only UN official associated with Bosnia and Somalia to survivewith his reputation unharmed When the United States decided to dumpBoutrosGhali in late  everyone touted Annan as the compromisecandidate to replace him Everyone that is except the French They wanted asecretarygeneral from Francophone Africa            Annan is a true internationalist He speaksEnglish French and several African languages fluently He has lived inGeneva Nairobi Cairo Accra and New York among other places His wife isSwedish the niece of Raoul Wallenberg in fact But Annan is aninternationalist with an American inflection He was educated here he lovesliving hereand according to an aide hell probably retire here            A UNsecretarygeneral is a CEO someone who needs to be independent enough to takethe initiative but tractable enough to heed his board members that is themember states Annan is well suited to this dual role For example Americanshave been demanding management reform for decades and Annan is the technocratwho may do itafter all he has a management degree from MIT Annans recentreform package cuts  jobs from the person Secretariat slashesadministrative costs by onethird and streamlines the United Nations absurdbureaucracy Annan is pushing meritbased promotion and management trainingancient ideas that are new to the United Nations Americans say Annan hasntcut enough others say he has cut too much In other words hes doing it justright Under BoutrosGhali the United Nations kept  peacekeepers inuniform Now postBosnia postSomalia and postBoutrosGhali there arebarely             Annan is the worlds most gentlemanly politician WhereBoutrosGhali was highhanded and arrogant Annan is gentle softspoken calmBoutrosGhali spoke English poorly rarely visited American leaders andregularly berated US misbehavior He was vicious without being tough Annanis tough without being vicious The United States would never have letBoutrosGhali negotiate with Hussein He was too reckless too erratic tooantiAmerican But Annan has formed a strong friendship with Secretary of StateMadeleine Albright She and her colleagues could trust him to win peace withoutappeasement            For the United Nations tothrive its not enough that the United States trust it The United Nationsmust also trust the United States That is Annans next test Americasreputation is at an ebb in UN Plaza The United States owes more than billion in UN peacekeeping dues These arrears are crippling the UnitedNations which gets a quarter of its billion budget from the UnitedStates The organization has already curtailed essential activities and may beforced to shut down next year if the Americans dont pay            Annan has been trying to prythe cash out of Washington since he took office Last fall Congress all butOKd a billion payout Then a few conservative members killed the fundingbill by attaching an unacceptable antiabortion amendment Annan visitsWashington this week to push again Albright is on his side Clinton is on hisside Andperhaps the best indication of Annans appealeven Jesse Helms ison his side Helms who just two years ago threatened to end all UN fundingwas charmed when Annan called on him last year Helms too favors settling theUN debt When a UN secretarygeneral can get Jesse Helms and SaddamHussein to fall in line he is doing something right
