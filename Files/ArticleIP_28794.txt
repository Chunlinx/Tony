                                 Learn Politics While You Drive            If you want to be a Republican candidateand whodoesnt reallyyou need a core set of principles a core set of beliefsa core vision and fire in the belly You must be true to yourself showthat you care and treat every voter like a precious soul And dont forgetto involve yourself with a highprofile cause before you announce yourcandidacyitll really help your fund raising            I know all this because I have spent the past weeklistening to Prepare To Win  a program of audiotapes and accompanyingworkbooks Im not kidding from the Republican National Committeefourhours  speakers senators House members etc and advice on everythingfrom fund raising to hiring staff to wooing the media The RNC is distributingPrepare To Win to hundreds of potential  candidates for Congressstate legislatures county commissioner and other offices Wouldbe candidatesare supposed to listen while they sleep eat or drive Heres RNC ChairmanJim Nicholson urging Republicans to listen over and over again to the tapes It was inevitable that selfimprovement culture which has infected everyother aspect of American life would eventually contaminate politics At lastit has            Washington wheremembers of Congress are all wellcoiffed wellspoken welldressed andwellprepped makes it easy to forget that politicians are made not born Forevery Bill Clinton who springs from his mothers womb wearing a blue suit andspeaking in sound bites there are scores of awkward ambitious Rotariansneeding guidance In days of yore aspiring pols learned their trade by sittingin the party clubhouse But political education has become alarminglysophisticated since the late s when Newt Gingrichs GOPAC began mailingtens of thousands of strategy tapes to Republican activists Both parties nowoffer seminars training candidates how to run But Prepare To Win marksthe first time either party has tried to educate prospectivecandidates            Unlike GOPACs tapes which mix strategy with redmeatideology Prepare To Win is pure process It mostly ignores Republicanpositions and concentrates on campaign mechanics Speakers urge you to payattention to filing deadlines hire a lawyer form a kitchen Cabinet of friendswho can rein you in if the campaign unhinges you court community leaders andseek their endorsement before you announce choreograph yourannouncement to maximize media coverage etc Its all sensibleenoughespecially the presentation of Sen Susan Collins of Mainebut itsthunderingly obvious After a couple of hours I began to ask myself How dumbdoes the Republican Party think I am Listen for example to New Mexico partyChairman John Dendahls leaden account of how to use humor in your campaign            The workbooks exacerbatethis condescending simplemindedness The  written questions that accompanyeach speech are of the sort I havent seen since sixthgrade readingcomprehension How according to Rep Jennifer Dunn of Washington do youbecome an Initiator Innovator and Leader What did Rep IleanaRosLehtinen of Florida learn as a girl scout leader Answer Beprepared            At heart however Prepare To Win is neithercommonsensical nor condescending It is deeplyso deeply that the speakersarent even aware of itcynical The superficial premise is that politics isabout harnessing your beliefs your honesty and your caring heart for thecommon good The political veterans dispensing advice genuinely seem to bepreaching idealism Speaker after speaker insists that your campaignmust be founded on your core principles beliefs vision whatever Myfavorite workbook question is What are your core principles If you have toask  The tapes overflow with Polonius platitudes Be true to yourselfPeople dont care what you know till they know that you care Sen SamBrownback of Kansas repeatedly insists that you see people as precious soulsnot as voters or contributors            But its odd to becelebrating precious souls on a tape series designed to teach candidatesexactly how to wring money from contributors and seduce skepticalvoters  While saying that candidates should be true to themselves thespeakers spend the bulk of their time detailing how campaigns are artifice andhow candidates must learn to manipulate voters contributors images andreporters            This fundamental cynicism reveals itself in countless smallways Here for example Georgia party Chairman Rusty Paul instructs how tomake a candidacy announcement political theater with the candidate as themain actor             The otherwise admirableSen Collins counsels listeners to embrace a cause before they becomecandidates but not because the cause itself matters The cause is a great wayto build a contributor base Listen to Rep Dunn as she gives cheerfulhappytalk advice about how to use anecdotes to show voters that you care aboutpeople and not just policy Women she notes are much more responsive to astrong positive message than they are to attacks Then in her final sentenceDunn offers her real advice Leave those attacks for the advertisingcampaign             Overwhelmingly I had the sense that myPrepare To Win instructors had no idea how cynical they sound Nowhereis this more apparent than in the presentation of Sen Kit Bond a folksyMissourian In this clip  Bond details his fundraising philosophy Heproudly describes how during his first congressional campaign he refused alarge contribution from someone who wanted him to change his position on anissue                           At that moment I made the decision that Iam running this campaign I am not going to be told by any contributor that Ishould take a stand they want me to solely because they would give me money forit I told em no thanks If they want to support me in the objectives Ihave outlined thats fine but I dont take positions or make votes inresponse to offers of contributions                        Bond says this as though recounting some remarkableachievement In fact what his grand principle amounts to is no vote for cashSen Bond does not take bribes Prepare To Win is this passage writlarge Beneath its pious talk of visions and core beliefs it is teaching alesson about politics that is much shabbier and much more real than the one itpretends to teach
