Current Federal Frequent Traveler PolicyUnder current federal laws and regulations the frequenttraveler benefits received by a federal employee in conjunctionwith official travel are generally considered government propertyand the employee may not retain the benefits for personal use As aresult the employee should accept the benefits on behalf of thegovernment and turn them over to the employees agency The agencyshould then integrate the benefits into its travel plans tomaximize their value to the governmentInitially this policy was enunciated and followed in a numberof prior Comptroller General decisions These decisions were basedon the fundamental rule of law that a federal employee is obligatedto account for any gift gratuity or benefit received from privatesources incident to the performance of official duty Any suchgifts gratuities or benefits tendered to the employee are viewedas having been received on behalf of the governmentIn  Congress enacted a statute designed to help realize tothe maximum extent practicable cost savings for official travelfrom frequent traveler benefits The statute directed theAdministrator of GSA to issue guidelines to ensure that agenciespromote encourage and facilitate the use of frequent travelerprograms offered by airlines hotels and car rental vendors byfederal employees who engage in official travel This actspecifically provides that any awards granted under such a frequenttraveler program accrued through official travel shall be used onlyfor official travelGSA has incorporated these policies into the Federal PropertyManagement Regulations and the Federal Travel Regulationapplicable to most federal civilian employees Similarly the JointFederal Travel Regulations applicable to members ofThese

accrued onofficial travel Such legislation would be necessary to repeal thecurrent requirement that such benefits be used only for officialtravel and to affirmatively authorize employees and members toretain for personal use these benefits that are now considered theproperty of the governmentUse of Frequent Flyer Miles for Official Travel Is Difficultand Appears LimitedComprehensive governmentwide data are not readily available onthe extent to which federal agencies capture and use frequent flyermiles for official travel GSA officials told us that they do notcollect such data However our task team did obtain information onGAOs practices as well as those of several other federalorganizations This information followsGAOs ExperienceGAO has never had a centralized formal program to reduce itstravel costs by capturing and using its employees official travelmiles Several years ago we pilottested a program in one of ourheadquarters units but soon discontinued it for a variety ofreasons These reasons which have also discouraged otherheadquarters units include the airlines refusal to establishseparate official and personal travel accounts for employeesemployees reluctance to participate administrative burdens andcosts and limited savings Furthermore few frequent flyer seatswere available at desired travel times transfers of free ticketsto other employees took time and effort and employees who flew ondifferent airlines often took a long time to accumulate enoughmiles for free tripsAlthough we never set up a GAOwide program to capture and usefrequent flyer miles several of our field offices tried toestablish such programs Of these the majority discontinued theirefforts for the same reasons that discouraged our headquartersunits Two field offices did however establish programs andcontinue to operate them yet their dollar savings have been verylimited One office saved  over about  months This officehas many employees with enough miles on single carriers for freetrips but these miles have been difficult to use because few seatshave been available when employees have needed to travelFurthermore in past years the units savings were reduced by the fee that the contract carrier charged for reservations madeless than  weeks in advance Accumulating sufficientThere are some federal organizations that are not covered by  of PL  and also have their own property disposalauthority One such organization we are aware of that does notprohibit its employees from retaining frequent flyer benefits fortheir personal use is the US Postal Service  of PL frequent flyer miles for this units employees has become moreproblematic since the government contracted with a differentcarrier for one of the units most heavily traveled routes Theother field office which reported saving about  over years also noted that multiple changes in contract carriers havemade it more difficult to accumulate and effectively use frequentflyer milesExperiences of Other Federal OrganizationsThe other federal organizations we contacted had variedapproaches to capturing and using frequent flyer benefits forofficial travel A representative from onethe US PostalService which is not subject to the travel rules that apply tomost federal agenciessaid that the Service does not prohibit itsemployees from making personal use of the frequent flyer milesreceived on official travelIn  the Department of the Interior considered establishinga frequent traveler program that would have been managed by acontractor However the Department rejected the contractorsproposal as too expensive and difficult to implement Interiorbelieved that the fees the contractor would have charged wereexcessive and the savings were uncertain In addition under thecontractors proposal Interior would have had to provide thecontractor with data on the frequent flyer miles received by itsemployees It would have had to obtain the data from the employeesbecause the airlines would not provide the information to theagencyAn Interior Department representative told us that some of itsbureaus use frequent flyer benefits to enable their employees totake training and attend conferences because their budgets do notcover nonprogramrelated travel Therefore if frequent flyermiles received on programrelated travel were not captured and usedfor this type of travel the bureaus might not be able to sendtheir employees to these types of events At the same time ifemployees were allowed to retain the frequent flyer benefits theymight be willing to use some of their miles for such travel on avoluntary basisGSA IRS and the Department of Justice have establishedgainsharing programs that enable frequent travelers to share inthe savings they achieve in airfares lodging costs or both Underthese programs employees can obtain cash awards based on savingsthey can document by using free tickets from airline frequent flyerprograms or by securing lodging rates below the maximum amountsallowedAccording to GSA officials GSA considered establishing afrequent traveler program in the early s but abandoned the ideabecause the airlines would neither pool the miles received by GSAemployees for the agencys use nor provide data to GSA on the milesits employees received In  however GSA established avoluntary gainsharing program under which employees who use freetickets awarded for official travel miles or secure lodging at lessthan the established lodging rates can receive cash awards of up tohalf the amount saved for the government GSA reported that fromJanuary  through September  almost  was savedunder the program and employees received about half that amount incash awards These savings do not take into account the costs ofadministering the gainsharing program which GSA officials believewere minimal However GSA officials view the program as a limitedsuccess because the savings are low relative to GSAs overalltravel costs which totaled about  million for the last years In addition GSA officials believe that most of the savingsare from the lodging portion of the program rather than from theuse of frequent flyer milesIRS established a program similar to GSAs in  at therequest of the National Treasury Employees Union Employees canaccrue savings by such means as using frequent flyer miles toobtain free airline tickets sharing hotel rooms with coworkers orstaying with friends or relatives IRS travel officials did nothave data on the savings achieved through their program because theprogram is less than a year old However they view the program asa success They said employees like the program and most of thesavings are in lodging costsThe Justice Department established its gainsharing program atthe beginning of fiscal year  Like GSA and IRS Justice sharessavings its employees achieve by using frequent flyer miles andobtaining lodging at reduced costs The program is discretionaryand Justice components can choose whether they want to includefrequent flyer savings lodging savings or both Administrativesupport staff who assist travelers who achieve savings can alsoshare in the savings awards According to Justice it saved about in fiscal year  and  in fiscal year  andpaid cash awards equaling about half of the savings Again thesefinancial benefits do not factor in the gainsharing programsadministrative costs Justice did not provide savings data beyondfiscal year According to a representative from DOD the Department does nothave a departmentwide frequent traveler program and has no data onthe extent to which its components have such programs He said thatin the mids his command attempted to but could not find aneffective program for capturing and using employees officialfrequent flyer miles anywhere in DOD He believes the use of freetickets awarded for frequent flyer miles in DOD is spotty at bestHe cited many of the same practical difficulties with implementingthe current federal policy that we and other agencies identifiedincluding the reluctance of both the airlines and employees toprovide frequent flyer data to the government and the problems withtracking and using miles for official travel He also identifiedanother difficultythe time and expense associated with takingdisciplinary action against employees who violate the currentpolicy by making personal use of miles received on official travelHe said his agency completed a demotion action against an employeefor personal use of miles but assistance from the airlines wasdifficult to obtain Such action he maintained was notcosteffective These difficulties combined with a departmentalemphasis on adopting privatesector practices have led DOD toprepare draft legislation that would abolish the currentrestriction and allow military and civilian employeesgovernmentwide to retain for personal use frequent flyer benefitsreceived on official travel He said that DOD has discussed itsproposal with other federal agencies which have been supportiveDOD is currently considering submitting its proposal to the Officeof Management and BudgetAn SEC representative informed us that SEC began using acontractors software  to  years ago to facilitate the use offrequent flyer mileage She said that employees participation inSECs frequent flyer program is voluntary and that SECs savingshave been minimal in part because frequent flyer tickets do notgive travelers flexibility in arranging their travel Specificallyshe said that it is difficult for SEC employees to obtain seatingusing frequent flyer tickets because many trips are scheduledcanceled or changed at the last minute Finally she said that SECis likely to discontinue its contract because the savings minusthe contractors percent commission are not sufficient tooffset SECs hidden management and oversight costs and employeeshave not been enthusiastic about participating in the programThe Private Sectors PracticesAccording to the results of three recent surveys the privatesector commonly allows its employees to retain for personal usefrequent flyer miles received on business travel This practice maygive the private sector including government contractors anadvantage over the federal government in recruiting and retainingemployees While small compared with the higher salaries companiesoften pay this advantage may nonetheless influence the job choicesof some employees especially if they are frequent travelersIn April  the National Business Travel Association surveyedits members via the Internet on frequent traveler programsAccording to the Association  companies responded Of these percent said they do not recover frequent traveler benefitsreceived by employees on business travel for their companies and percent said they have no plans to do so According to theAssociation most companies do not want to become involved incapturing these benefits because it is too difficult to track milesor points receivedIn May  the Bureau of National Affairs reported the resultsof a  survey of about  companies on their business travelpolicies These companies about  of which responded to thesurvey represented a cross section of US employers  percentwere manufacturing companies  percent were nonmanufacturingeg service businesses and about  percent were otherestablishments such as health care facilities educationalinstitutions and government agencies Seventy percent of thecompanies had fewer than  employees and the remainder hadmore According to the survey most employers with businesstravelers allowed their workers to keep frequent flyer milesreceived on business travel for their own use About twothirds ofthe responding companies reported specifically allowing theiremployees to retain the miles for their personal use about percent reported having no policy at all and under  percentreported requiring their employees to relinquish mileage receivedto the company A few companies reported having gainsharingprograms similar to GSAs IRS and JusticesThe findings from these two surveys appear consistent with theresults of an American Express survey of business travelmanagement reported in July  by Business Travel News abusiness travel industry publication According to the articlediscussing this survey the trend in the private sector was awayfrom collecting frequent flyer awards and the number ofcorporations doing so was declining Specifically the surveyshowed that the proportion of companies managing and using frequentflyer miles received by their travelers fell from  percent in to  percent in  According to the article most companiesneither want the headache of tracking miles nor the disincentivethat taking them away might present to employees In addition thearticle discussed the views of the travel services manager of acompany that was using a contractor to aggressively track and usefrequent flyer miles for company business Although this approachwas saving the company  percent of its overall air travel coststhe manager said he would rather receive discounts from theairlines than deal with frequent flyer milesThese survey results are also consistent with the experience ofone large corporation that we contacted in  after learning thatit had established a program to capture and use for company travelfrequent flyer miles received by employees on company business Thecompany later told us that it had discontinued the program becauseof its adverse effect on employee morale In April  wecontacted the company again and a representative told us that thecompany continues to allow its employees to make personal use offrequent flyer miles received on company travelViews on Frequent Flyer IssueYou asked for our views on this issue as well as those of theForeign Service Officers Association I will discuss theAssociations views firstIn April  the Director of Congressional Affairs for theForeign Service Officers Association told us that the Associationwould support legislation that would allow federal employees tokeep for personal use frequent flyer miles earned on officialtravel He said the Association recognizes that many foreignservice officers frequently travel long distances and wouldtherefore receive considerable benefits from such legislationHowever he noted that these officers are often assigned tohardship locations that require difficult travel He also said thatif this type of legislation is not feasible the Associationsmembers would like to be able to use their frequent flyer miles toupgrade to business class on long flightsIn our view the current federal policy on frequent flyer mileswas well intentioned as a potential means for reducing federaltravel costs and promoting economy in government We recognize thatfederal agencies including GAO might be able to achieve someadditional savings by taking more advantage of frequent flyer milesfor government travel However the practical obstacles toachieving significantly greater savings are such that few agencieshave overcome them without creating incentives such asgainsharing plans that have generally reduced the governmentssavings by half Additionally more aggressive efforts to usefrequent flyer miles to reduce the governments travel costs couldaccording to GSA jeopardize its ability to negotiate significantsavings under its contract air carrier program This negotiatedtravel program saves the government over  billion annually GSAofficials responsible for the program told us they believe thesavings achieved through this program far outweigh the benefits thegovernment would gain through more aggressive efforts to captureand use frequent flyer miles for official travel We do not knowhow a change in the current federal policy to permit individual usewould affect GSAs ability to negotiate savings in contractairfares However a change would not seem likely to have anegative impact since in contrast to the current policy it wouldbe consistent with the airlines position that frequent flyer milesbelong to the individual travelerChanging the federal policy on frequent flyer miles would havesome disadvantages for the government First it would eliminateany savings that certain agencies currently achieve by implementingthe policy In addition some employees who now travel on freetickets obtained with frequent flyer miles might no longer be ableto travel when funds for air travel were not available or were inshort supply However these disadvantages would we believe befar outweighed by the advantages of a change both to federalemployees and to the government A change would eliminate thecurrent disparity in practice between the private sector and thegovernment and would put federal employees on a par with theirprivatesector counterparts including federal contractorpersonnel in this area Like privatesector employees federalemployees who put up with flight delays and cancellations andtravel on their own time to meet work schedules would then feelthat they were being compensated in part for these frustrationsand sacrifices Establishing parity between the federal governmentand the private sector in this area would also aid the governmentin recruiting and retaining topquality employeesIf the current policy is changed to allow federal civilian andmilitary employees to retain their official travel miles forpersonal use controls over the need for travel and the selectionof routes and carriers would have to be effectively implementedThese controls are designed to prevent employees from selectingcertain carriers to earn miles or otherwise undercutting thegovernments negotiated fare agreements with major carriersToday millions of frequent flyer miles earned on officialtravel are going unused benefiting neither the government nor itsemployees Changing the federal frequent flyer policyand changingit retroactively so that employees can take advantage of theseunused mileswould boost federal employees morale and strengthenthe federal governments ability to compete with the privatesector We therefore believe Congress should consider allowingfederal employees to keep and make personal use of the frequentflyer miles they have already received and will receive forofficial travel In order to assist the Committee we have encloseddraft legislation that would accomplish this objective see encIIf you have any questions on the
