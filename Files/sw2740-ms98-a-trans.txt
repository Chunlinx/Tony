                um i was thinking about the uh the topic you know while they were searching for a person   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh while i was thinking about it i just flipped on my TV and it was funny because i thought about today how so much of i mean i even my social life is renting movies or sitting at home and you know watching a rented movie or watching a movie on TV   uhhuh yeah   and just now its so i mean every everything is just so uh easy that you almost dont have to think of things to do anymore   yeah   you know what i mean   i do and like even even little kids who watch like Sesame Street and everythings really fast paced and they dont have to to sit down and concentrate on one thing for a long time and   yeah i mean i remember when i was little my friends uh my parents im sorry would just go over peoples houses and just sort of you know sit and talk   yeah   and before TV and all that people would sit and listen to the radio and and that i mean life has just changed and become so much more modernized and uh its really pretty incredible   yeah yeah just the other day i uh some AM station or something had a um like a radio show just like the old days you know it was like from the old days and i was thinking gosh thats i mean because you have to imagine what everybody looks like and you dont understand it until you actually hear it and have to do it and its i mean you know its just too bad that everybody has everything fed to them   oh really i know uhhuh and you know when you think about oh i was watching reruns of Happy Days the other day and um       to think that that was the social life of teenagers to go to uh you know a a place like Arnolds and order a soda pop     yeah   and uh you know sit and hang out and and you know just the dress codes the whole atmosphere the whole attitude of teenagers and social life was totally different then   yeah i mean now we always have to do something new or better or more exciting cant just sit around and talk for awhile you know   uhhuh uhhuh i know   its too bad   i know and also um i think that its so much more dangerous for people now   yeah   i mean before you could go out and and you know you didnt have all the drunk drivers and you didnt have to worry about your kids getting into the wrong crowds and this and that   uhhuh   and now thats really a problem   yeah it really is   you know  but what what do you do most of the time for social activities   um just well im fifteen so   oh okay   oh just a lot of times we do sit around and because like uh im really glad that im in like uh the classes uh like honors classes and so its like whats really good about that is that you meet people who really are interested in in talking about things and discussing world issues and   uhhuh yes yes   it just and it makes me sick to go to school and know people who just thats all they do is like go out and  you know try to go find a new guy or something its just so immature and oh just futile you know   uhhuh uhhuh yeah i i definitely agree um are your you cant drive yet then can you   no ill be driving in a few months   okay oh in a few months you said oh thats good well youre going to find that driving changes your social life completely   yeah yeah   i mean suddenly when youre free to go where you want to go its amazing i mean i dont know if youll always have a car around thats a different issue   yeah   but um uh just even being able to go to a movie when you want and and not relying on somebody else its really pretty nice   uhhuh yeah it is     but um one thing i love to do and maybe its just  because i like to eat       but one of my favorite things to do with friends is just go out and try a new restaurant   yeah   and uh and i dont know just go and i dont know try like a a new ethnic restaurant you know Indian food or or something like that   yeah   and i think so often we do social things like you were saying you know going out and picking up guys or or whatever social things that dont really   yeah   are that arent really social like when you go to a movie youre not sitting and talking to anybody     yeah   and when you go to a bar its usually so loud or so crowded that you even that you cant talk to anybody   yeah yeah   you know um and going out to dinner i think is a nice way youre out youre out of the house um   uhhuh   i think playing games is something that my friends and i love to do   uhhuh   weve um weve bought Pictionary you probably know that and i dont know some other games and um and i know this sounds kind of corny but     yeah it was it does sound corny but its so much fun   it really is and if you get the right group of friends   yeah   they have a good attitude about it then you know you can have a pretty good time   yeah you really can   uhhuh   awesome     i personally think that i should have been born in the fifties because i do i do love that era and uh   yeah   and i really think that i could have gotten into i dont know the the music and the lifestyle and um things just seemed so much easier didnt they   yeah yeah   you know it just seems like you didnt have so much to worry about   i know everybodys i mean everybodys always busy and worried and so many problems people dont just sit down and you know just talk and know everythings going to be okay   yeah yeah thats true well who knows maybe another maybe the the twenty first century will bring a whole new type of social life   yeah yeah things go in cycles you know maybe   yeah i get very frustrated when i go over to a friends house and all they want to do is sit and play computer games   oh yeah   you know i i dont know if youre familiar with any of them but       theyre theyre fun you know and theyre theyre you know not bad to like take up some time but they just are so um exclusive   uhhuh oh yeah   you know you get two people in front of a computer playing a computer game and the the next room could be on fire       and theyll never know it you know   oh that s the truth     but   well it was nice talking to you   yeah nice talking to you   yeah and gosh i hope you guys cool off down there   yeah           okay     talk to you later bye   all righty byebye
