coverage ofPresident Clinton and Vice President Gore may we expect an article fromWeisberg on the sinister intellectual conformity of the left             DanielleCrittendenWomens Quarterly Washington                           Jacob Weisbergresponds I dont think so There is PC on the left no doubt but thisepisode is hardly an illustration of it The idea that a writer who despisedRonald Reagan would have been made editor of a leading conservative magazine isunimaginable The Michael Kelly of the right wouldnt have had to be fired Henever would have been hired in the first place                           TaxAmericana                        You wasteeveryones time by running pieces by Jodie T Allen on the economy taxes andthe stock market In A Brief History of Taxes the chart she runs with herdiatribe against supplyside economics is worthless as even Paul Krugman wouldadvise because it accounts for neither the efficiency of the market indiscounting changes in tax law throughout the legislative process nor thevolatility of monetary policy during the last  years of a floating dollarThere are other minor variables at work including differences that occurbecause of taxes on income and taxes on wealth but I would not trouble Allenwith those Her attempt to correlate one variablethe date of passage of a taxcut or increasewith GDP is not serious stuff And by the way at the time itpassed in  we told our clients the Clinton tax increase would do no greatdamage to the economy because the other variables were positive             JudeWanniski Polyconomics IncMorristown NJ                           TaxReturn                        Jodie T Allens A Brief History ofTaxes was indeed brief though perhaps appropriately so given the verynarrow focus of her argument What Allen utterly failed to address is the factthat regardless of their effects on aggregate consumption and investment taxhikes are badand tax cuts goodfor individual taxpayers While it is quitetrue as she notes that Republicans adhere to the questionable belief thattax cuts are ipso facto good and tax hikes are ipso facto badfor the economy and the financial markets those same Republicans also tend tobelieve that wealth is inherently the property of the individual who createdit            This isnot a subtle point and it is certainly not one that Republicans have ever beenshy about expressing Bob Dole ran his entire  presidential race promising apercent income tax cut The accompanying Its your money slogan whileunconvincing to both voters and pundits is fundamentally true It is alsoessential to consider it when weighing the merits or ills of a proposed changein tax rates Individuals claims to their wealth and income must of course bebalanced by the need to finance governmental activities no matter how few andinconsequential they may be For that reason arguments for the completeelimination of taxes would be absurd a fact that almost everyone regardlessof political affiliation can recognize Equally lacking in wisdom howeverare analyses such as Allens which only evaluate taxes macroeconomicconsequences while ignoring completely the effects they have

ignorance like a hospitalgown reveals ones bum Consider this quote The AMA pitches itself asAmericas selfless medical counselor indifferent to the demands of themarketplace            Regardless of the statementsvalidity it shows that Plotz hasnt the faintest idea of what the marketplaceis The marketplace is me and you and everyone else who wants medical careHow can ignoring peoples medical wishes be considered a good thingSelfless It would be the very height of selfishness and arrogance for theAMA to ignore the marketplace            In his next sentence Plotzsays Dunlap by contrast is the marketplace No He can be at mostone                actor in the marketplace Plotz then goes on to denigrate thenotion of efficiency as if it were selfevidently bad rather than inarguablygood Plotz also misuses the concept of the invisible hand using it to meansomething quite apart from what Adam Smith intended            Plotz tries to vilify Dunlapbut anyone who understands economics sees that Dunlap is actually a good guyincreasing the efficiency of businesses and creating wealth About the workers fired from Scott Paper Plotz does the usual handwringing because hehas not learned to view the big picture A society that can meet its tissueneeds with  fewer people is more efficient it is a society that has people who can now do something more productive There are only so manyhands in the world to work andviewing things in strictly economictermsthose fired workers are a freed resource freed by Dunlap True theirlives are temporarily screwed but businesses do not exist to hand outpaychecks they exist because they do something useful in an efficient mannerWere it otherwise wed be kneedeep in unwanted buggy whips            If Slateprinted an article dealing with principles
