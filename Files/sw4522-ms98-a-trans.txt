                 okay no my father was in a nursing home and   uhhuh      i just uh i really hope that i would just die before before and matter of fact you know i feel the same way for my mother   yeah how long ago was that   uh he was in the nursing home about four years ago but he was you know in there for several years   okay yes but that was uh okay so that was fairly recent and even then   yes   a lot of the conditions i think youre right they havent improved that much   no they havent and they they uh the way they the way the uh nurses and the nurses aids and  they treat them   yeah umhum yeah the   they treat them they treat them just utterly horrible they cuss them they tell them how sorry they are and that theyre you know they uh one uh aid told him that he was no longer a man   yeah huh   you know i mean good you know its its its really really bad and and on and on top of that i worked in a im im out of the warehouse now but i worked in a warehouse in the company for the company that im working for now   sounds tough yeah right   and two of the women that were utterly horrible   uhhuh   worked uh in the nursing home worked off and on for years in nursing home and they hate old people   oh yeah thats that  doesnt seem right does it     yeah oh yeah thats really ill say you know this really makes me feel good about whats going  but uh   yeah i you know you walk into one of those places and you basically start to feel depressed because they dont a lot of places dont have a good atmosphere theyre just its almost like they just shove people in there and wait for them to die   right   you know and its its really its a bad problem uh i work at Honeywell up here and i was talking to a guy thats actually working toward mobility aids for handicap people and one of the things hes done is interview uh nursing home directors because theyre looking for  get this theyre trying to find out ways to restrain patients so that they dont look like theyre restrained because apparently the family members who come to visit get upset understandably upset when they see that their loved one is in restraints you know uh at the same time you have to restrain him because they might hurt themselves they might stand up and not be able to to stay stood up or might fall down or whatever   oh how horrible right   so its an interesting problem thats just one of the many things that you know you have to think about in a nursing home   right   but you know the stuff that you told me is theres no excuse for that you know   i know it there is no excuse that uh uh you know my uh one thing you really must do you know i feel like that go to a nursing home drop in at times that you dont normally drop in   right stuff when theyre not on their guard you know   right and dont uh i i would go visit a nursing home uh several different times several different nursing homes before you came to the point of having to put a family member in there   oh sure you know its its really a good idea to look at places and see whats out there and see what the the modes of treatment are   right   and and how people act   right its uh its you you its the same its the same premise as day care for a child   yeah you know it really is you know that brings up a good point ive got a friend of mine up here and we were talking about this because his father is getting to the age where theyre going to have to decide what to do and   uhhuh   he brought up a real interesting suggestion that works well for families that have a lot of kids in it like i come i come from a family that has five kids   uhhuh uhhuh   well the way he said it was our parents spent you know quite a bit of time when we were young taking care of us you know call it call it three years per child now if you have five children thats fifteen years total   certainly uhhuh   therefore shouldnt it be right that they should be able to stay with one family member uh in a rotating fashion for fifteen years free of charge   well you dadgum right if you know   there you go it its essentially repayment   right if you uh if the uh parent and the children will do that but theres okay   yeah thats it but the thing is hold on i got one more thing and ill let you talk  because we started talking about that you know we started saying well you know some family members might not agree to do that   im sorry right   and he said fine let the one who does agree to do it keep him keep the father keep the father or mother for a longer time and charge the family member who doesnt cooperate just say basically look       uh ill take care of mom and dad for you but you have to give me a kind of a payment for doing that for you   right   you know so essentially it it relieved them of the burden   uhhuh   uh and at the same time everybody kind of comes out happy i dont know if that would work but then again it it depends on the family size   right it may work with some families and it may not work at all with some families you know but my Lord you know i had a a   yeah uhhuh
