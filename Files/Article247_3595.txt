                                 Will Disney Save Us From Disney                        Dear Witold            If one measure of a communitys success is as Ivebeen told its ability to bring like minds together then I must complimentCelebration Fla on at least the one count of giving us a pretext tocorrespond Celebration of course is the town built by Disney and ourconcern here is the two recent books about the town The Celebration Chronicles Life Liberty and the Pursuit of PropertyValue in Disneys New Town  by Andrew Ross and Celebration USA Living in Disneys Brave New Town  byCatherine Collins and her husband Douglas Frantz            I wonder if you shared my spooky feeling reading bothof these books a feeling totally unconnected with literary merit or effectYou and I were both early visitors and pioneer critics of Celebration you forThe New Yorker and I for Harpers magazine but that was back when the town had no residentsand at least when I was there no habitable houses My experience with thetown began in  when it was still a vast pasture and palmetto swampattached to the Disney World campus outside Orlando On a later visit averitably complete downtown had sprung up but it was yet vacant itsstorefronts without signs its windows without glass not a solitary pedestrianalong its streets Witnessing that kind of progression the field giving way tothe skeletal empty immaculate ruin is the common experience of thearchaeologist but not of the urbanologist What complete city was ever all atone time empty But the poor archaeologist can only wonder about the lives ofthe people who lived in the citys bones hard as one might work to get thosebones to speak And thats the spookiness We saw the ruins and wondered aboutthe lives and now with these two books the ruins are speaking and the placehas come miraculously to life            Both these books follow a similar trajectory Theirauthors moved in early in Celebrations existenceRoss into an apartment andFrantzCollins into a  Savannah model twostory homeand watched thetown unfold during the first year of its infancy seeking like some anxiousparent the significance behind every diaper change and wobbly step Theyrecord many of the same events The conflicts over school quality shoddy homeconstruction Disneyenforced conduct codes And they eventually seem to concurin their wistful conclusion that if Celebration is a bit of a corporate harlotit yet has a heart of gold or at least of honest brass and does not deservethe easy contempt of its ohsosophisticated detractors            Now we who once critiqued the town are invited tocritique the towns critics The town we can surmise from this has come along way Id like to volunteer that these books have drawn some perverselyunsatisfying combination reviews most notably in the Sept  New York Times  which devoted the weight of  column inches by mypica rule to admiring Celebration USA  exceptfor one paragraph spent denouncing The CelebrationChronicles on the astonishing grounds that Mr Ross is a single man in anapartment without a mortgage or children and thus had no real stakeequipping him to comment This credentialscommittee rebuke must have made evenMr Frantz and Ms Collins cringe avowed admirers of diversity that they areBut it opens up an interesting question What is the purpose of Celebration Itisnt a mill town or a railroad town a seaport or fallline entrepot TheTimes review in its denunciation of Ross bachelorinsufficiency implied that the towns purpose was focused on child rearing andreal estate accumulation And surely education and innovative housing were bigdraws for many residents But most of those residents it is clear from theseaccounts also were animated by enthusiasm for the larger experimentCelebrations selfdeclared mission of turning around the souldeadening blightof suburban sprawl and employing virtuous design and bedrock communityprinciples to reinvigorate the nations civic life Far from innocentCelebration was a knowing soul from the beginning Mr Ross writes WhileFrantz Collins and Ross admit to a bit of discomfort at their roles as spiesin the laboratory Celebrations knowingness makes them more than justspectators In an experimental town whose residents pull it up by the rootseach morning to see how it is doing whose central motif is selfinspectionthe authors are the professional selfinspectors Celebrations originalcaptains of industry            The Times reviewer calledMr Ross tone oracular and it is appropriately Both of these books areoracles The issues they raiseMr Ross more abstractly and wittily MrFrantz and Ms Collins more earnestly and intimately are not side issues tothe American experiment They are as deep and as urgent as the questionCelebrations patriarch and muse Walt Disney expressed in a memo before hisdeath Is democracy the best way to run a town These books and perhaps ourconversation concern the heart of the American charter in the corporate ageDoes it take a Disney to save the American community And if it does is thatbecause the enemy we are saving it from is Disney Because of these issues weall have a stake in Celebration and I look forward immensely to talking withyou about the town and about these books
