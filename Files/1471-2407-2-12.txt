                    Background        The promise of improved outcome with the use of        hematopoietic growth factors in the treatment of acute        myelogenous leukemia AML has yet to be realized In        several prospective trials patients were randomized to        either a hematopoietic growth factor or a placebo after        induction chemotherapy in an attempt to accelerate        neutrophil recovery and improve outcome These studies        consistently show accelerated neutrophil recovery without        an increase in leukemic relapse in patients treated with        either granulocyte colony stimulating factor GCSF or        granulocytemacrophage colony stimulating factor GMCSF              Unfortunately these studies have failed to        consistently show a benefit in terms of remission and        survival when administered in such an adjuvant fashion                   The hematopoietic growth factors have also been studied        for their therapeutic benefits when given before        chemotherapy Both GCSF and GMCSF recruit quiescent        leukemic blasts into cell cycle thus rendering them more        susceptible to the Sphase specific cytotoxicity of        cytarabine          Several studies suggest a        potential therapeutic benefit from administering        hematopoietic growth factors before starting        cytarabinebased chemotherapy                However the results of larger randomized trials have been        disappointing       Not only have remission and        survival rates not been increased but the direct effect of        growth factors on the untreated leukemia has led to severe        toxic reactions and death             Chemotherapy also recruits quiescent leukemic blasts        into cell cycle Burke and colleagues demonstrated in an         in vitro model that following an        initial cycle of chemotherapy humoral factors are        generated which are capable of recruiting quiescent        leukemic blasts into Sphase    The maximal        recruitment occurred about  to  days after chemotherapy        was administered To apply these observations clinically        patients were first treated with cytarabine and        daunorubicin This initial cycle of chemotherapy was then        followed by either a second course of cytarabine on day         or AMSA on days  This timed sequential therapy        achieved a complete remission rate of  in         de novo and  in secondary AML           Timed sequential therapy has been employed in relapsed        and         de novo acute leukemia and achieves        complete remission rates comparable to those achieved with        other salvage chemotherapeutic regimens            The combination of timed sequential chemotherapy and        hematopoietic growth factors allows for an initial        cytoreductive course of chemotherapy before starting growth        factors The growth factor could then work with the other        humoral factors generated by chemotherapy to maximize        recruitment of leukemic blasts into cell cycle Few studies        have tested this approach We report the results of a        clinical trial assessing the potential benefit of adding        GCSF to a proven timed sequential chemotherapeutic        regimen                    Materials and Methods                  Patients          All patients had AML defined according to the standard          FrenchAmericanBritish FAB cytologic and cytochemical          criteria     Patients were considered to have          goodrisk cytogenetics if their karyotype revealed either          t inv t or t A normal          karyotype defined intermediaterisk cytogenetics All          other clonal abnormalities were considered poorrisk          Patients were eligible for this protocol if their          leukemia was  refractory to previous induction          chemotherapy  in first or subsequent relapse after          initial complete remission following induction          chemotherapy  secondary to transformation from an          antecedent hematologic disorder or  secondary to          previous exposure to cytotoxic agents All patients were          over  years of age Only patients with a performance          status of  or less and no organ failure less than grade           according to the World Health Organization WHO          grading system could enter the study except if organ          failure was related to the leukemia itself Patients with          leukemic meningitis were excluded All patients gave          signed informed consent and were treated on clinical          protocols approved by the Cleveland Clinic Foundations          Institutional Review Board                          EMAG Regimen          The EMA regimen contains etoposide mitoxantrone and          cytarabine administered in a timedsequential fashion             We added GCSF to the EMA regimen thus EMAG EMAG          consists of mitoxantrone  mgm per day intravenous          IV bolus for  days day  to  with cytarabine           mgm per day IV continuous infusion CI for  hours          day  to  Etoposide  mgm per day IVCI for           hours and cytarabine  mgm per day IVCI for  hours          were administered on day  to  GCSF  mgkg per day          subcutaneouly was started on day  and continued until          the absolute neutrophil count ANC rose above             L for two consecutive days Fig  Only one course of          EMAG induction was given Post remission therapy          included chemotherapy allogeneic bone marrow          transplantation BMT or peripheral stem cell          transplantation PSCT at the treating physicians          discretion and availability of a transplant donor          All patients were cared for in semiprivate rooms          supplied with HEPA filters on a regular oncology unit          All patients received standard supportive care including          blood component support for severe cytopenias as          previously described    Acyclovir  mgm per day          IV or  mg PO bid allopurinol  mg PO qd and          fluconazole  mg PO qd were administered          prophylactically                          Evaluation of Therapy          Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies were obtained on          day  of chemotherapy and then at the discretion of the          treating physicians When a bone marrow aspirate or          biopsy obtained on or after Day  contained  or more          blast cells GCSF was stopped          Complete remission CR was achieved when the          following parameters were met  bone marrow was          normocellular containing  blasts           erythroid cells and  normal granulocytes           peripheral blood had neutrophils     L          hemoglobin  gmdl and platelets     L           no evidence of extramedullary leukemia and  all of          the above fulfilled for at least  weeks Nonresponse to          EMAG induction was defined as the absence of CR after          one course of induction therapy Relapse was defined by          the appearance of circulating blasts or bone marrow          blasts  in a patient previously in complete          remission                          Evaluation of Toxicity          Severity of treatmentrelated toxicity was graded          according to the WHO criteria World Health Organization          Handbook for Reporting Results of Cancer Treatment                                    Statistical Analysis          The method of Kaplan and Meier was used to analyze          overall survival relapsefree survival time to          neutrophil recovery and time to platelet recovery Exact           confidence intervals CI based on the binomial          distribution were calculated for proportions such as the          complete response rate                            Results                  Patients          From August  to November   patients were          enrolled onto this study One patient received highdose          cytarabine instead of EMAG for induction therapy after          enrollment and was therefore excluded from further          analysis Thus  patients received EMAG induction          therapy and are evaluable for treatmentrelated toxicity          Only  patients are evaluable for induction response          since  patient was lost to followup shortly after          receiving induction therapy no evidence of persisting          leukemia by the postinduction bone marrow biopsy The          characteristics of the evaluable patients are listed in          Table  Twentyeight patients had cytogenetic studies of          bone marrow aspirates Most patients  had          unfavorable karyotypes The majority of patients           had secondary AML transformed from either MDS n            CML n   or other myeloproliferative diseases n            or secondary to cytotoxic agents n   Overall           patients with secondary but untreated AML were          enrolled Four patients were enrolled with AML refractory          to previous induction therapy and  were enrolled with          relapsed AML                          Recovery of neutrophil and platelet counts          The median time from the start of chemotherapy to          recovery of an absolute neutrophil count exceeding             L was  days range  to

        with CR had secondary leukemia Twelve patients           failed to achieve CR following induction treatment One          of the nonresponders had no evidence of leukemia after          induction treatment and proceeded to bone marrow          transplant before meeting all of the criteria for          complete remission Three patients  died during          induction treatment          Of the  patients who achieved CR  patients          received further consolidation chemotherapy  with high          dose cytarabine and  with intermediate dose cytarabine          combined with daunorubicin etoposide or interleukin          and  patients received either allogeneic BMT or          allogeneic PSCT One patient relapsed before any          postremission therapy was given Of the  patients who          did not achieve CR  received salvage chemotherapy           received allogeneic BMT and  died due to rapid disease          progression                          Survival          The median overall survival OS for all evaluable          patients is  months range  months Median          relapse free survival RFS for those who achieved CR is           months range  months with  patients censored          at allogeneic BMT or PSCT At fiveyears of followup           patients  were still alive Two of them were in CR          one of whom had allogeneic BMT and the other had high          dose cytarabine as postremission therapy The third          patient is alive with recurrent leukemia                          Treatmentrelated Toxicity          All patients experienced fever in the setting of          severe neutropenia Fifteen  patients had documented          infections Three patients  died from febrile          neutropenia and sepsis Other WHO grades IIIIV toxicity          included mucositis  diarrhea  skin rash           nausea and vomiting  bleeding  Ten           patients had reversible hyperbilirubinemia and            had WHO grades IIIIV renal insufficiency Three           patients experienced severe neurological toxicity           with seizure  with severe vertigo but those          complications resolved shortly after the completion of          induction therapy GCSF was stopped in  patient due to          persisting peripheral blasts When GCSF was discontinued          the peripheral blasts cleared and the patient achieved a          complete remission                            Discussion        Hematopoietic growth factors clearly increase the        cytotoxicity of cytarabine to leukemia cells         in vitro     Clinically        however they fail to increase remission rates when started        from  to  hours before any chemotherapy              Potential explanations for the failure of growth factors        to improve results when administered in this fashion may        reflect either their adverse effect on a large leukemic        burden or the necessary delay to the onset of chemotherapy           In our study we started growth factors after the        initial leukemic burden was reduced and then optimized the        timing of a second course of chemotherapy to take advantage        of known leukemic blast cellcycle kinetics    Our        results are comparable to those achieved with other salvage        chemotherapeutic regimens that employ highdose cytarabine                      Rather than use a standard highdose cytarabine regimen        we employed the EMA chemotherapy protocol devised by        Archimbaud and colleagues    This regimen is effective        in patients with relapsed and refractory AML with a        reported CR rate of  In addition EMA avoids the        cerebellar neurotoxicity of highdose cytarabine        Recognizing the potential value of hematopoietic growth        factors Archimbaud and colleagues added GMCSF to the EMA        regimen beginning on Day  of treatment Unlike the current        report however GMCSF was discontinued on Day  of        treatment Unfortunately the addition of GMCSF did not        increase the CR rate when it was compared to placebo in a        prospective randomized study in patients with relapsed and        refractory AML    The results with EMA and EMA plus        GMCSF are compared with our own results in Table         Clearly the patient population in our study was        different than the population studied in the other two        studies employing the EMA regimen Our population is older        and a majority of our patients had secondary AML These two        characteristics are among the most predictive of a poor        outcome Although  of our patients were untreated at the        time of study enrollment all  had secondary AML and  of        them had CML in blast crisis unresponsive to hydroxyurea        therapy The poorrisk features of our patient population        probably explain our relatively low CR rate compared to        other EMA studies but also confirm the efficacy of our        treatment protocol since remissions would only be expected        in  of untreated patients with secondary AML        receiving initial induction chemotherapy             Our study did not demonstrate a significant advantage to        the addition of GCSF to the EMA regimen Potential reasons        include the possibility that GCSF failed to increase the        population of leukemic stem cells in Sphase over that        achieved with chemotherapy alone Alternatively recruitment        of blasts into Sphase may not increase cytotoxicity to a        clinically significant degree Finally even if Sphase        increases cytotoxicity and GCSF is effective in increasing        the proportion of blasts in Sphase these effects may not        be sufficient for patients with advanced leukemia In the        few studies exploring the role of timedsequential        chemotherapy as primary treatment for         de novo untreated AML results have        been more encouraging with high remission rates and        prolonged survival            An initial concern with EMAG was the effect the        concurrent administration of GCSF and chemotherapy might        have on bone marrow recovery However the concern was        unfounded since the median time to neutrophil and platelet        recovery is not different than that noted with EMA Table         This observation suggests that GCSF may be        administered concurrently with chemotherapy without an        increase in toxicity to normal residual bone marrow Other        studies utilizing hematopoietic growth factors administered        before and concurrently with chemotherapy also demonstrate        no adverse effect on bone marrow recovery                         Conclusions        The treatment of advanced highrisk AML patients remains        challenging The use of EMAG in the current study failed        to demonstrate a better CR rate than published data of EMA        alone or EMA with GMCSF EMAGM However the  CR rate        achieved in our cohort of patients with a higher proportion        of secondary AML and older median age suggests that the        EMAG regimen deserves further study in a population of        patients
