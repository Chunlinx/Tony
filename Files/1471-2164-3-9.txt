                    Background        Coiledcoil domains are protein oligomerization motifs        which consist of two or more alpha helices that twist        around one another to form a supercoil     Peptides        with the capacity to form coiled coils are characterized by        a heptad repeat pattern in which residues in the first and        fourth position are hydrophobic and residues in the fifth        and seventh position are predominantly charged or polar        This pattern can be used by computational methods to        predict coiledcoil domains in amino acid sequences                    Coiledcoil proteins can be grouped into two general        classes The first class is comprised of short coiledcoil        domains of six or seven heptad repeats also called leucine        zippers They are frequently found as homo and        heterodimerization domains in transcription factors eg            The second class is defined by long coiledcoil        domains of several hundred amino acids which are found in        a variety of proteins involved in structuring cellular        processes            One of the three main classes of cytoskeletal proteins        the intermediatefilament proteins represents a        wellcharacterized group of coiledcoil proteins A        subgroup of intermediatefilament proteins are the nuclear        lamins which are involved in attaching chromatin to the        nuclear envelope and have recently been implicated in        inherited human diseases      Besides structural        proteins of the cytoskeleton the motor proteins that        interact with them also contain coiledcoil motifs Myosin        the actin motor protein has an extended coiledcoil domain        necessary for the assembly of the muscle thick filaments            Kinesin and dynein two microtubule motor proteins        also contain coiledcoil domains             The coiledcoil motif has also been identified in a        variety of proteins associated with centromeres        centrosomes the nuclear matrix and chromatin                TPR a protein associated with the inner        filaments of the nuclear pore complex is an extended        coiledcoil protein     The filamentous structures        associated with both the outer and inner surface of the        nuclear pore complex suggest that additional unknown        coiledcoil proteins might be involved in its assembly        Several large coiledcoil proteins were also found        associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi        apparatus and two of them have been shown to function in        the docking of vesicles to the Golgi cisternae              AKAPs are adapter proteins that attach protein kinase PKA        pathways to cytoskeletal elements At least one AKAP AKAP         is a large coiledcoil protein attaching PKA to the        centrosome            Despite the multitude of cellular functions in which        coiledcoil proteins participate the general theme is the        association of proteins with the solidstate components of        the cell In some cases as in the attachment of PKA this        function appears to be crucial for the spatial regulation        of signal transduction Importantly mutations in        individual coiledcoil proteins lead to specific        developmental or even behavioral phenotypes The Drosophila        mutations         Mushroom body defect a gene involved        in the proliferation of neuronal precursor cells and         quicktocourt a mutation that        causes elevated sexual behavior lie in two        tissuespecifically expressed coiledcoil proteins of        unknown function      In humans and mouse models        specific point mutations in nuclear lamins are the cause        for autosomal EmeryDreifuss muscular dystrophy                    In contrast to animals and yeast only a small number of        long coiledcoil proteins have been identified from plants        MFP contains an extended coiledcoil domain and is located        at the nuclear periphery of tobacco suspension culture        cells      The carrot protein NMCP is also located        at the nuclear rim and has been shown to migrate to the        spindle poles in dividing carrot suspension culture cells             The cellular function of these plant proteins is        not known        Several candidates for myosins and kinesins have been        identified from plants and their function as motor proteins        is under investigation      Besides these few        examples nothing is presently known about plant long        coiledcoils and their potential function in anchoring and        structuring of different cellular events        In the early nineties several groups reported        laminlike proteins in different plant species              A purification protocol adapted from animal lamins and        applied to pea nuclei was used to purify four proteins        between  and  kD     These proteins were        recognized by antibodies against mammalian intermediate        filament proteins and by antibodies against a peptide        derived from lamin B By immunofluorescence and immunogold        labeling these antigens were located mostly in the        internal nuclear matrix and not predominantly at the        nuclear rim Similar results were obtained by other        investigators     Although these early reports were        promising no lamin ortholog has been identified        molecularly from plants In a recent search of all publicly        available plant sequences including the full         Arabidopsis genome no homologs of        lamins were found     and Meier unpublished results        Similarly despite earlier reports of laminlike proteins        in yeast     the fully sequenced         S cerevisiae genome    also        contains no lamin genes It is therefore likely that        nonanimal eukaryotes have a distinct set of nuclear        envelope proteins that functionally replace the lamins        Here we have used a tomato protein containing long        coiledcoil domains to search the Arabidopsis genome for        related sequences We have identified seven novel        Arabidopsis proteins with extended coiledcoil domains        which form a protein family distinct from other Arabidopsis        long coiledcoil proteins They are characterized by four        novel motifs which are highly conserved in sequence and        position and which were not found in proteins outside of        this family In addition a rice homolog was identified        indicating conservation between dicots and monocots                    Results                  LeFPP a novel plant coiledcoil protein          A yeast twohybrid screen was performed to identify          interaction partners of the tomato nuclear          envelopeassociated protein LeMAF     A prey          plasmid pADLeFPP was identified that led to activation          of the two reporter genes           HIS and           LacZ after retransformation with          the pBDLeMAF bait We tested the specificity of this          interaction by cotransforming pADLeFPP with two          additional bait plasmids pBDAtMAF and pBDAtRanGAP          AtMAF is one of three Arabidopsis homologs of LeMAF          Patel and Meier unpublished results and has  amino          acid identity with LeMAF AtRanGAP is one of the two          Arabidopsis Ran GTPase activating proteins Its          Nterminus has  amino acid identity with LeMAF and           with AtMAF Fig C      Fig Ashows that          pADLeFPP leads to activation of the           HIS gene in combination with          pBDLeMAF sector a and with pBDAtMAF sector b but          not with pBDAtRanGAP sector c or the binding domain          vector pBDGAL alone sector d This demonstrates that          the observed interaction is specific for MAFlike          proteins          Fig Bshows the quantification of Galactosidase          activity in the pBDLeMAFpADLeFPP strain Lanes one          and two are the positive and negative control provided          with the kit respectively lane three shows the activity          of the pBDLeMAFpADLeFPP strain and lane  the          activity of the pBDGALpADLeFFP strain Although yeast          twohybrid interactions can not be easily quantified the          very high level of Galactosidase expressed by the          pBDLeMAFpADLeFPP stain suggests a comparably strong          interaction in the yeast twohybrid screen          The  bp pADLeFPP cDNA was sequenced and was shown          to contain an uninterrupted open reading frame in frame          with the GAL activation domain The conceptual          translation of this sequence leads to a protein of           amino acids aa with a calculated molecular weight of           kDa and a pI of  The first methionine is at          position  and does not have a plant start ATG          consensus sequence     suggesting that the cDNA is          not full length          A BLAST search with the pADLeFPP open reading frame          indicated that it represents a novel protein with weak          similarity to filamentlike proteins from animals and          yeast see below Secondary structure prediction          algorithms showed that it is organized almost entirely in          alphahelical domains and contains extensive stretches of          coiledcoil domains Fig Aand Fig  The protein was          named LeFPP for tomato filamentlike plant protein RNA          blot analysis showed a single species of mRNA of ca           kb It is present in tomato leaves fruits flowers          lightgrown seedlings and darkgrown seedlings Fig          B                          A family of LeFPPlike proteins in          Arabidopsis          A BLAST search was performed with the LeFPP amino acid          and DNA sequence In a protein BLAST sequences with          highest scores represented a number of uncharacterized          open reading frames in the Arabidopsis genome followed          by sequences for animal filamentlike proteins such as          myosin kinesin ankyrin etc While the evalues for the          Arabidopsis ORFs were between e and e the best          evalue for a nonplant sequence was  for an unknown          human open reading frame The Arabidopsis hits          represented seven unique genes some of which had          repeated entries in GenBank see Table           A translated BLAST search identified one additional          hit in the rice BAC HB of chromosome  GenBank          accession number AL The hit lay between the          annotated open reading frames HB and HB          in a region of DNA not predicted to have coding capacity          However running GenScan    on this part of the BAC          an open reading frame of  amino acids was identified          on the opposite strand that contained the hit The          predicted coding region begins at position  of the          HB DNA sequence ends at position  and          contains seven predicted introns This rice open reading          frame was named OsFPP and was included in the sequence          and structural analysis shown in Fig and Fig           Fig shows a comparison of the secondary structure of          LeFPP with the seven Arabidopsis ORFs and the rice ORF          All open reading frames are characterized by extended          alphahelical and coiledcoil domains The extension of          the coiledcoil domains shown in Fig is derived from          the coiledcoil analysis software in the DNASTAR          sequence analysis software package and was confirmed in          all cases by the MultiCoil algorithm     In addition          MultiCoil predicted that all coiledcoil regions have a          high probability to form dimers and a low probability to          form trimers The seven Arabidopsis ORFs were named          AtFPP  AtFPP Fig and Table  They fall into two          groups according to size and extension of coiledcoil          domains AtFPP AtFPP and AtFPP are shorter  aa          to  aa and contain two extended coiledcoil domains          connected by a short noncoiledcoil linker AtFPP to          AtFPP are longer  aa to  aa and contain a          longer Nterminal and a shorter Cterminal coiledcoil          domain separated by a long noncoiledcoil linker domain          Fig  The rice ORF OsFPP resembles structurally          more the second group of Arabidopsis ORFs with two          shorter stretches of coiledcoil domains separated by a          long linker                          Novel sequence motifs define a subfamily of plant          coiledcoil proteins          Alignment of all nine amino acid sequences showed the          presence of four novel sequence motifs which are           conserved between the tomato and Arabidopsis proteins          Fig A Motifs II III and IV are also  conserved          in OsFPP while motif I is present but slightly less          conserved in the monocot sequence Their location in each          protein is indicated in Fig  Their position with          respect to the arrangement of the coiledcoil domains is          strikingly conserved despite differences in spacing          between the four motifs due to the different length of          the proteins and the coiledcoil domains          Motifs I and II always correlate with the Nterminal          cluster of coiledcoil domains with motif I being          located at the beginning and motif II at the end of this          cluster Motif III is always located in the linker          between the Nterminal and Cterminal coiledcoil          domains Motif IV is always located at the very end of          the most Cterminal coiledcoil domain This positioning          is conserved even in the rice sequence where the          Cterminal coiledcoil domain is extremely short Fig                    The amino acid identities between the eight dicot          proteins are in the range of  to  Fig B with          the rice sequence showing between  and  identity          with the dicot sequences The Arabidopsis protein with          the greatest similarity to LeFPP is AtFPP           identity          Table shows an overview of the genomic organization          of           AtFPP through           AtFPP and of the features of the          predicted proteins The genes are not clustered and no          two of them are arranged in tandem array Except for          chromosome  at least one member of this gene family is          present on each chromosome ESTs have been identified for          all genes indicating that they are expressed Table           Consistent with the ubiquitous expression pattern found          for           LeFPP            AtFPP expression covers a variety          of tissues and developmental stages including shoots          hypocotyls roots and siliques          In order to identify more long coiledcoil proteins in          the Arabidopsis genome the complete list of annotated          ORFs was searched with the keyword myosin to identify          ORFs that had been annotated as myosinlike proteins          Because of the long stretches of conserved heptad          repeats BLAST searches with large coiledcoil proteins          usually produce significant evalues with at least some          of the large number of myosin heavychain sequences in          GenBank frequently leading to this annotation          The  ORFs identified this way were analyzed by          MultiCoil and  were found to contain coiledcoil          domains of at least  amino acids  ORFs showed no          coiledcoil motifs and were discarded AtFPP and AtFPP          had been annotated as myosinlike too and were          therefore identified in this search They were discarded          to avoid duplication None of the remaining  new          coiledcoil proteins contained any of the conserved          motifs identified in the FPP family          The  new sequences were aligned with the seven AtFPP          sequences in a CLUSTAL analysis Fig shows the results          represented as a phylogenetic tree The AtFPP family          clearly forms a family of sequences separate from the          other coiledcoil proteins boxed in Fig  The three          short AtFPPs AtFPP AtFPP and AtFPP form a          subfamily as do the four long AtFPPs AtFPP AtFPP          AtFPP and AtFPP see Fig  Interestingly the two          most closely related           AtFPP genes           AtFPP and           AtFPP are located in comparable          positions on two duplicated segments of chromosome           indicating that they might be derived from a recent          duplication event                            Discussion        A novel class of plant coiledcoil proteins has been        identified that are conserved in dicots and monocots Seven        members of the FPP protein family are present in the        Arabidopsis genome They are characterized by the presence        of two clusters of coiledcoil domains separated by a        linker domain of variable size Four highly conserved        sequence motifs were identified which are a signature        feature of this protein family and which are also conserved        in the homologs LeFPP and OsFPP from tomato and rice        respectively The tomato homolog of the FPP family binds in        a yeast twohybrid assay to a nuclear envelopeassociated        protein indicating that they might function in nuclear        envelope biology        Besides the presence of extended coiledcoil domains        the FPP family members have no sequence similarity to the        vertebrate lamins They also do not show significant        sequence similarity to other vertebrate nuclear        envelopeassociated proteins such as LAP LAP MAN and        emerin GenBank accession numbers A S QWU        and XP respectively None of these proteins        appears to have a convincing ortholog in the Arabidopsis        genome data not shown consistent with the hypothesis        that the composition of nuclear envelopeassociated        proteins differs significantly between the plant and animal        kingdom        Interestingly a recent report about the protein        composition of the nuclear envelope of the highly divergent        eukaryote         Trypanosoma brucei has identified a        coiledcoil nuclear envelope protein TbNUP in this        organism that also has no similarity with lamins            TbNUP is a  kDa protein with a striking repeat        structure Its full sequence is presently not known but a        partial open reading frame of  amino acids has been        constructed     The nearperfect  amino acids        repeats contain two coiledcoil domains each Pairwise        alignments of TbNUP with AtFPP through ATFPP showed no        significant sequence similarities beyond the typical low        degree of similarity generally observed between coiledcoil        proteins data not shown The TbNUP open reading frame        was also used for a BLAST search of the full Arabidopsis        genome Only comparably weak similarities with other        myosinlike proteins were found        The four conserved sequence motifs identified in the FPP        family appear to be unique to this group of coiledcoil        proteins and are neither shared by other coiledcoil open        reading frames present in the Arabidopsis genome nor by        coiledcoil proteins such as lamins from other organisms        Their role in the structure or function of the FPP proteins        is presently not known but their high degree of        conservation in the tomato and rice sequences imply that        they are of relevance Several functional small conserved        motifs have been identified in other families of long        coiledcoil proteins The nuclear lamins contain short        conserved sequences flanking the lamin rod domain which        are phosphorylated by cdc kinase     The  amino        acid PACT domain which immediately follows the coiledcoil        domain of the related proteins pericentrin and AKAP and        two uncharacterized coiledcoil open reading frames from        Drosophila and         Schizosaccharomyces pombe  confers        centrosomal localization     A conserved domain of ca         amino acids was found in several Golgiassociated large        coiledcoil proteins It has been named GRIP domain           or Golgi localization domain GLD    and is sufficient        to specify Golgi targeting in mammalian cells Nearly all        intermediate filament proteins exhibit a highly conserved        amino acid motif YRKLLEGEE at the Cterminal end of their        central alphahelical rod domain which has been shown to be        crucial for the formation of authentic tetrameric complexes        and for the control of filament width            No sequences with similarity to the consensus sequences        of motifs II III and IV were found in the databases that        might indicate their potential function However a        sequence with some similarity to motif I was identified in        the hemaglutininesterase fusion glycoprotein from        influenza virus C GenBank accession number S        Alignment of this sequence amino acids  to  with the        central conserved residues of motif I        AGWEKELKLRHD  indicating        nonconserved residues shows a good match of identical and        conserved amino acid residues        AGFEKDLKIRHE The fusion        glycoproteins contain a coiledcoil domain and are involved        in fusing the viral envelope with the host cell membrane        The conformational change of the protein necessary for        membrane fusion is driven by ionic interactions between        residues of the coiledcoil domain and Glu the last        amino acid aligning to motif I is involved in this process            In light of their putative interaction with the        nuclear envelopeassociated protein MAF it will be        interesting to investigate if FPPs are associated with        membrane systems of the plant cell                    Conclusions        A family of novel long coiledcoil proteins has been        identified from plants They are characterized by two        clusters of long coiledcoil domains separated by a        noncoiledcoil linker and by four novel sequence motifs        Seven members of the         filamentlike plant protein          FPP  family are present in the        Arabidopsis genome and one homolog each has been        identified from tomato and rice Thus this family of        proteins appears to be conserved among higher plants but        we have not found convincing homologs from yeast or animals        by sequence similarity searches Tomato FPP was originally        isolated in a yeast two hybrid screen with MAF a small        plantspecific protein associated with the nuclear envelope            Because the full Arabidopsis genome does not        appear to contain genes for lamins it is of particular        interest to investigate which other long coiledcoil        proteins might functionally replace lamins in the plant        kingdom The FPP family represents an exciting group of        candidates for such proteins                    Materials and methods                  Yeast twohybrid screen          Total RNA from young tomato leaves            Lycopersicon esculentum  was

was cloned as an EcoRIXhoI fragment between          the EcoRI and SalI sites of the bait vector pBDGAL          Statagene Approximately one million primary          transformants were screened for growth on histidine          dropout plates All steps of the library screening          including the transformation the isolation of clones          and the verification of the interactions and the          Galactosidase assays were performed as described by the          manufacturer pBDAtRanGAP    and pBDAtMAF were          both constructed by cloning an EcoRI fragment containing          the complete open reading frames into the EcoRI site of          pBDGAL The AtMAF open reading frame was isolated by          PCR from Arabidopis genomic DNA using the  primer          TCC ATG GCC GAA ACC GAA and the  primer CTA          AGT TCA CTT CGA ACT GCT C which had been designed to          match the Arabidopsis MAF homolog on the P clone MGG          of chromosome  GenBank accession number AB
