                it looks like um were going to have um a um sort of a third party movement on our hands in the fall   yeah   and uh i guess the last time that happen was uh well i guess it was Anderson in seventy two and then there was Wallace in sixty   Anderson   eighty or whenever it was   yeah i remember remember Anderson but also a little a little young for that one     i guess the what i see behind it this this this uh maybe its always true of third party movements but this one seems to be almost entirely negative almost completely a reaction to uh um uh failure of the other two parties rather than anything positive thats uh represented   yeah i  thats a pretty good point i hadnt thought about it like that but yeah its i guess its not really um a start up with uh necessarily new ideas and you know this is my positive outlook but rather uh saying well uh im just not very happy with uh with the other two parties seem to be going type of thing   yeah i think theres absolutely no political philosophy the only thing that uh Perot um seems to has to offer is that uh hes a doer   yeah     and since most people agree on what needs to be done but nobody can figure out how to do it hes just going to say uh im a CEO i know how to tell people to do things and get them done   yeah   which is uh pretty attractive and when uh Congress cant seem to be able to get anything done   yeah i guess read a political cartoon uh must be probably about a week ago now or maybe you saw it i dont know how widespread this was but it showed uh Perot like revealing his you know what he stood for or whatever its kind of like he had showed him open up his overcoat and  open he open they drawed him um they drew him  opening up his overcoat and inside was another overcoat   uhhuh     so its like you know his he hasnt really he hasnt really said very much of what he stands for or what you know hes kind of pretty much  vowed to saying you know ill get ill get this done and get that done you know but what is this and that type of thing     yeah   but   well i think um its its a reaction to whats whats happened over the last ten or fifteen years where um the parties really just seem to be intent on blocking the other party from getting any further the the uh   yeah   the Democrats want to get the Republicans out of the White House and Republicans want to try to get control of Congress but they dont seem to have any really big ideas or sweeping um vision of where things should go   yeah   and now things are are so stalled that uh out of uh pure frustration comes along with uh uh a guy who says he can get things done   yeah   so maybe he is part of a um a more general trend in politics over the last twenty years   the um uh i dont know those of us who werent too happy with the Reagan years saw that as a as just a um  of selfishness and um   yeah   government just got out of the way there wasnt no prevailing philosophy except do what you can to get you something for yourself   yeah it it it seems it seems as though that thats definitely definitely a point of the two parties pretty much trying to block each other and theres been a definite id say definite loss in actual you know ideals and theres just theres too much each side you know where theres Republican or Democrat both of them like trying to   um   you know either play to the hands of like what the dominant philosophy is uh not not not not dominant but like old style philosophy of each each   um   in each party and not really coming up with a new ideas or the or maybe i mean it it you know its time for maybe a definite new vision and and whats going on which may be you know a blend of both you know maybe both parties or you know a little bit of this a little bit of that which may not fall into the lines of either party but you know just doesnt seem as though either party wants to do very much that rocks the boat or maybe maybe says oh its time for a little bit of you know   um yeah   things arent going very well oh in the big picture maybe right now Congress getting better or its maybe its getting worse or who knows but you know its just like a little ripple in the ocean its  know some some somebody got to look down the road a ways and say well whats going to go on   yeah what yeah what i see is all tactics and no strategy um that and uh   yeah yeah   its i mean its fun to watch on a day by day basis but it doesnt get anything done in the long run   right right     if all youre interested in is making the other guy look bad and making yourself look good you dont really accomplish anything   right yeah   in the long run the infrastructure deteriorates and people kind of lose their uh sense of a of purpose   yeah yeah i take that definitely
