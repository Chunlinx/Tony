                    Introduction        The Golgi complex is an elaborate cytoplasmic organelle        that has a prominent function in the processing        transporting and sorting of intracellular proteins        Autoantibodies directed against the Golgi complex were        first identified in the serum of a Sjgrens syndrome        patient with lymphoma     Subsequent reports described        antiGolgi complex autoantibodies AGA in patients with        systemic rheumatic diseases such as systemic lupus        erythematosus     rheumatoid arthritis     and        Wegeners granulomatosis     Immunoblotting and        immunoprecipitation studies have shown that there was        heterogeneity of reactivity among AGA            Within the past several years our laboratories and        others have cloned and identified novel Golgi autoantigens        golgins     This has been achieved primarily by        expression cloning using human autoantibody probes The        identified autoantigens referred to are golginGCP             golgingm     golgin            golgin p       giantinmacrogolginGCP             and golgin     These proteins are        characterized by predominant helical coiledcoil domains        except for Ntermini and Ctermini It has been reported        that some golgins are localized to the cytoplasmic face of        Golgi membranes     Functions of the golgins have been        proposed in vesicular transport and in maintaining        structural integrity of the Golgi complex              The potential implication is that these Golgi proteins may        have common biochemical characteristics that may make them        targets of autoimmune responses in certain disease        states        It is not clear why and how the immune system is able to        recognize or target intracellular autoantigens One        possible explanation is that they may be recognized as        surface structures on cytoplasmic organelles that are        released to the immune system in aberrant disease states        associated with unregulated cell death apoptosis or        necrosis resulting from injury or infection or defective        clearance of dying cells A variety of autoantigens are        cleaved into signature fragments during apoptosis and        necrosis     Other cell death posttranslational        modifications in autoantigens include hyperphosphorylation        deubiquitination methylation citrullination and        transglutaminase crosslinking             The emerging view is that modified forms of autoantigens        generated during cell death might stimulate autoantibody        responses if presented to the immune system in a        proinflammatory context     Since the fate of the        Golgi complex during cell death has not been extensively        explored we investigated whether the Golgi complex and        associated autoantigens are altered during apoptosis and        necrosis Using AGA as probes we observed that the Golgi        complex undergoes dynamic changes during apoptosis distinct        from those observed in necrosis Immunoblotting analysis        showed distinct cleavage fragments of Golgi autoantigens        generated during apoptosis and necrosis Since the cleaved        Golgi autoantigen fragments are antigenic they may play a        role in sustaining autoantibody production in autoimmune        disease states                    Materials and methods                  Antibodies          Human prototype serum containing highly specific          antipolyADPribose polymerase PARP antibody and AGA          sera were obtained from the serum bank of the WM Keck          Autoimmune Center The Scripps Research Institute CA          USA Rabbit antibodies to Golgi autoantigens were          produced in New Zealand White rabbits                Briefly recombinant human Golgi autoantigens were          produced using the expression plasmid pET system in           Escherichia coli Novagen Madison          WI USA Recombinant golgin amino acids           GenBank accession number BAA giantin amino acids           GenBank accession number NP gm          amino acids  GenBank accession number AAF          and golgin amino acids  GenBank accession          number AAB proteins were purified by affinity          nickel column chromatography They were then used to          immunize one or two rabbits separately by subcutaneous          injection of recombinant proteins in an equal volume of          Freunds complete adjuvant After booster immunizations          the immune sera were prepared and stored at C The          appearance and titers of antibodies were monitored by          indirect immunofluorescence and immunoblotting          analysis                          Induction of cell death          Human Jurkat and HEp cells were obtained from          American Type Culture Collection Rockville MD USA and          were cultured in RPMI  and Dulbeccos modified          Eagles medium Life Technologies Rockville MD USA          respectively containing  fetal bovine serum under          standard conditions Induction of cell death was          performed essentially as described elsewhere    with          some modifications          Apoptosis was induced in Jurkat T cells  ml by          exposure to  M staurosporine STS ALEXIS San Diego          CA USA for up to  hours Apoptosis in HEp cells was          induced by exposure to  M STS at C for up to           hours Necrosis was induced in these cells by exposure to           M STS for up to  hours or by treatment with           hydrogen peroxide H            O             Fisher Scientific Pittsburgh          PA USA for  hours Necrosis was quantified using the          trypan blue exclusion assay which measures loss of          cytoplasmic membrane integrity as described previously                        At least  cells were counted in triplicate in three          independent experiments In some experiments Jurkat          cells were incubated for  hour in the presence of the          pancaspase inhibitor          benzylocarbonylValAlaAspfluromethylketone zVADfmk          ALEXIS used at  M prior to addition of STS          Treated and control cells and their extracts were          analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence andor          immunoblotting analysis Spontaneous cell death prior to          the experiments was minimized by maintaining exponential          cell growth Cell viability was quantified by trypan blue          exclusion analysis at the beginning of every experiment          to ensure that cell cultures used in the experiments were          healthy alive cells                           Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy          Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as reported          previously       HEp cells were grown on          eightchamber vessel tissue culture slides Becton          Dickinson Franklin Lakes NJ

secondary antibodies were Alexa  conjugated goat          antirabbit IgG or antihuman IgG reagents ALEXIS          Cells were counterstained with          diamidinophenylindole nuclear stain prior to          immunofluorescence microscopy The estimation of the          percentage of cells at each morphological stage described          in the following for Golgi staining in apoptotic cells          was obtained by scoring  cells in each          experiment                          Immunoblotting analysis of cell lysates          After incubation in the presence of          celldeathinducing reagents Jurkat cells were          centrifuged at             g for  min followed by one wash          at             g for  min in PBS containing          Complete Protease Inhibitor cocktail Roche Mannheim          Germany Cell pellets   were then resuspended          directly in lysis buffer containing  mM NaCl  mM          MgCl             H            O  mM TrisHCl and           NP          The lysates were passed several times sequentially          through gauge to gauge needles to shear the DNA          and protein concentrations in the lysates were determined          by Protein DC Assay Kit BioRad Hercules CA USA to          ensure equal loading of proteins in each SDSPAGE lane          After determination of the protein concentration lysates          were mixed with an equal volume of   gel sample buffer          containing  sodium dodecyl sulfate  glycerol           mercaptoethanol  bromphenol blue and Complete          Protease Inhibitor cocktail Lysates were stored at C          until use          The equivalent of  g total lysate protein was          loaded onto each lane of  SDSPAGE gels separated by          electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose          membranes using a SemiDry TransBlot apparatus          BioRad Immunoblotting was performed as described          previously      using human antiPARP specific          antibody  and AGA  Detection

 cells          HEp cells exposed to  and  M STS exhibited          apoptoticlike fragmentation into multiple round bodies          after  hours of treatment Fig cd Interestingly          cells exposed to  M STS showed a more pronounced loss          of cytoplasmic membrane integrity Fig e indicating          that this STS concentration drove cell death more rapidly          into necrosis As control cells treated with levels of H                     O             previously shown to provoke          massive necrotic cell death    exhibited a          characteristic necrotic morphology Fig b associated          with rapid loss of cytoplasmic membrane Fig e                          Changes of the Golgi complex during          apoptosis          Changes in the Golgi complex during apoptosis were          examined by immunostaining with AGA in HEp cells          treated with  M STS Apoptosis was defined by          stereotypic morphological changes especially evident in          the nucleus where the chromatin condenses and compacts          and assumes a globular crescentshaped morphology              Figure shows a composite of four apoptotic stages          provisionally called stages IIV Fig bcde that          are classified on the basis of progression of apoptotic          nuclear change middle panels and corresponding staining          for golgin left panels          About  of cells appeared unaffected after           hours of incubation in the presence of STS as evidenced          by perinuclear Golgi staining identical to untreated          cells Fig a Interestingly swelling of the Golgi          complex with vesicular staining stage I was observed in           of cells and is most strikingly demonstrated in          Fig b It is estimated that the area occupied by the          swelled Golgi can be   times the normal size for          Golgi complex in HEp cells Slight changes in the shape          of some nuclei were observed as shown in the middle          panel but most cells with Golgi swelling exhibited no          change in nuclear size and shape          About  of cells appeared to be in stage II Fig          c where there was elongation of the nucleus appearing          kidney or crescent shaped middle panel A          characteristic of stage II was that the Golgi complex was          condensed at the concave or indented region of the          crescentic nucleus right panel Stage III Fig d was          seen in  of cells with defined nuclear fragmentation          into two approximately equal fragments middle panel and          golgin primarily located at the cleavage zone between          the two nuclear fragments right panel About  of          the cells were considered to be at stage IV Fig e          where their nuclei were fragmented into more than two          pieces middle panel and golgin staining appeared as          vesicular structures This was the final stage when          remnants of the Golgi complex could be detected          Evaluation of cells after  hours of incubation with           M STS showed all four stages described data not shown          At this time up to  of cells were in stage I           were in stage II  were in stage III and  of          cells were in stage IV These data suggested that          STStreated cells do not enter the apoptotic pathway at          the same time which is consistent with the notion that          apoptosis is a relatively asynchronous process          Similar staining patterns to those seen with golgin          were observed when apoptotic HEp cells were stained          with antibodies to golgin golgin golgin and          giantin data not shown These results were also          reproduced in HeLa S and mouse JA cells treated          with  M STS data not shown The amount of Golgi          swelling observed in stage I varied in different          experiments but the characteristics for stages IIIV          were highly reproducible in all the experiments we have          conducted Our observations of Golgi swelling during          apoptosis are supported by previous studies For          instance in neurons undergoing apoptosis morphologic          changes were characterized by a highly ordered sequence          of organelle abnormalities with swelling of endoplasmic          reticulum and Golgi vesiculation that preceded most          nuclear changes or mitochondrial disruption                                        Changes of the Golgi complex during necrosis          In contrast to the Golgi swelling already described          striking fragmentation of the Golgi complex was observed          during necrosis in HEp cells treated with  M STS          Fig f As shown in Fig be approximately  of          cells treated with this STS concentration while          initially showing apoptoticlike fragmentation into          multiple bodies gradually died by necrosis Figure          fshows Golgi fragments clearly visible arrows in cells          with condensed nuclei after  hours of treatment with           M STS Note the absence of nuclear fragmentation in          these cells compared with apoptotic cells Fig e          consistent with previous observations showing that          necrotic nuclei exhibit condensation but not          fragmentation     In this treatment designed to          drive apoptotic cells more rapidly into necrosis changes          in the Golgi complex similar to the four stages observed          in apoptosis were not detected Similar results were also          obtained for other Golgi autoantigens including          golgin giantin and golgin data not shown          No Golgi staining was observed in HEp cells treated          with  M STS for  hours or with  H            O            data not shown presumably due to          the extensive cytoplasmic damage associated with          necrosis These results suggested that the Golgi complex          is affected differently in apoptosis and in necrosis          prompting us to examine whether specific Golgi proteins          are targeted for proteolysis in these modes of cell          death                          Golgi autoantigens are cleaved during apoptosis and          necrosis          It is well established that specific intracellular          autoantigens are cleaved into different fragments in          Jurkat T cells and other cell types undergoing apoptosis          and necrosis     Mancini           et al  reported that golgin          native protein  kDa was cleaved into a  kDa          fragment during apoptosis     We therefore performed          an immunoblotting analysis using extracts from Jurkat          cells treated with apoptosisinducing reagent  M STS          or necrosisinducing reagent  H            O             to investigate whether Golgi          autoantigens are cleaved in the two major types of cell          death PARP  kDa protein was selected as a positive          control to monitor the cleavage of proteins during          apoptosis and necrosis because its cleavage products in          Jurkat cells undergoing apoptosis  kDa and undergoing          necrosis  and  kDa are well established                         Figure shows the results of immunoblotting analysis          using antibodies to PARP and four Golgi autoantigens In          cells treated with STS Fig  left or H            O            Fig  right PARP was cleaved          into an  kDa polypeptide apoptotic fragments or           and  kDa polypeptides necrotic fragments          respectively with complete degradation of native protein          as previously described     Golgin was cleaved          into  and  kDa fragments in apoptotic cells          consistent with published observations     In          contrast to the apoptotic fragments a  kDa fragment          was detected in necrotic cells Giantin was cleaved into          three major apoptotic fragments   and  kDa          and these fragments were clearly different from the           and  kDa fragments derived from necrosis          Interestingly while apoptotic fragments of golgin and          golgin were not detected necrotic fragments at  and           kDa were detected for both proteins A summary of the          Golgi protein fragments generated during apoptosis and          necrosis is presented in Table                           Proteolysis of Golgi autoantigens induced by          apoptosis is caspase dependent          The caspase family of proteases plays a central role          in apoptosis by participating in a cascade of cleavage          events that result in the apoptotic phenotype     We          investigated whether the proteolysis of Golgi          autoantigens caused by treatment with STS was caspase          dependent Jurkat cells were treated with  M STS for           hours after preincubation with the pancaspase inhibitor           M zVADfmk The generation of proteolytic fragments          from Golgi autoantigens was completely blocked in Jurkat          cells pretreated with zVADfmk Fig  indicating that          cleavage of Golgi autoantigens during apoptosis is          mediated by caspases                            Discussion                  Apoptotic changes of the Golgi complex          Lane           et al  reported recently that the          Golgi complex in HeLa cells is fragmented into scattered          vesicles by caspases due to interference of Golgi          reassembly and abnormalities of the  kDa stacking          protein GRASP     In the present report we          describe characteristic changes of the Golgi complex          during the progression of apoptosis It is not known          whether the Golgi complex functions as a stress sensor          involved in the regulation of apoptosis Mancini           et al  reported that caspase was          localized at the Golgi complex and generated a unique          cleavage product of golgin     Furthermore          these investigators proposed that the Golgi complex          transduces proapoptotic signals     A precedent for          this hypothesis was provided by Nakagawa           et al  who reported that          caspase is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and          mediates an endoplasmic reticulumspecific apoptosis          pathway     In the present study we have found that          all Golgi autoantigens examined were cleaved in apoptosis          in a caspasedependent manner as evidenced by studies          showing that the pancaspase inhibitor zVADfmk          completely blocked the apoptotic fragmentation of these          antigens Although the requirement for specific caspases          was not examined here it is possible that caspases          localized in the Golgi complex including caspase          transduce death signals during the early stages of          apoptosis that are associated with fragmentation of          specific Golgi proteins          It has been reported that apoptotic death receptors          such as CD     tumor necrosis factorrelated          apoptosis inducing ligand receptor  tumor necrosis          factorrelated apoptosis inducing ligand receptor               and tumor necrosis factor receptor     are          enriched in the Golgi complex prior to transport to the          plasma membrane thus suggesting that the Golgi complex          may play an important role in apoptotic signalling We          now provide evidence for characteristic alterations in          the Golgi complex corresponding to nuclear change during          the progression of apoptosis Swelling of the Golgi          complex was particularly detected in the early stages of          apoptosis It could be speculated that apoptotic          alterations of the Golgi complex may facilitate the          transportation of death receptors from the Golgi complex          to the plasma membrane and may amplify the apoptotic          events once apoptosis was initiated Additional studies          are needed to examine the precise function of the Golgi          complex during apoptosis                          Role of apoptotic or necrotic fragments in          autoantibody production          Analysis of posttranslational modifications in          intracellular autoantigens associated with apoptosis and          necrosis should provide important insights into the          possible role of cell death in the generation of          potentially autoantigenic forms of cellular antigens          CasciolaRosen and coworkers have proposed that          modifications of autoantigens during cell death          particularly proteolytic cleavage might be crucial for          the generation of autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases               Unique proteolytic fragments of fodrin and          type  muscarinic acetylcholine receptor have been          implicated in the generation of autoantibody responses in          primary Sjgrens syndrome               Although direct evidence that autoantigen cleavage          fragments produced during cell death elicit autoantibody          responses is still scarce Pollard           et al  reported that immunization          of BS mice H s with a  kDa proteolytic cleavage          fragment of fibrillarin derived from nonapoptotic cell          death elicited antibodies that are comparable with human          antifibrillarin autoantibodies and those derived from          mice exposed to mercury     In a study using human          sera Greidinger           et al  reported that the          recognition of apoptosisderived and oxidatively modified          forms of the  kDa subunit of U small nuclear          ribonucleoprotein autoantigen was associated with          distinct disease manifestations     Furthermore          Oriss           et al  demonstrated that a          combination of antigenprocessing cells and a fragment of          DNA topoisomerase I efficiently elicited autoreactive          Tcell proliferation whereas the fulllength          topoisomerase I required additional stimulus of exogenous          interleukin              These data point to a crucial role for fragments of          autoantigens in the generation of autoantibody responses          In the present study several Golgi autoantigens were          detected cleaved into distinctive fragments during          apoptosis and necrosis It has been speculated that these          modified forms of autoantigens may have enhanced          immunogenicity through exposure of immunocryptic epitopes          that are not generated during antigen processing                 These epitopes could trigger autoimmune          responses if presented to the immune system under          proinflammatory conditions     and they may be          recognized as surface structures on cytoplasmic          organelles that are released to the immune system in          aberrant disease states          Autoantibody responses could be amplified and          maintained on repeated stimulation if the exposure of          intracellular antigens to the immune system is associated          with defective clearance of apoptotic cells prolonged          necrosis primary or secondary Tcell cytotoxicity          associated with chronic infection or even antigen          mutation or overexpression It would be important not          only to assess the immunogenic potential of subcellular          particles and proteolytic fragments released during cell          death but also to continue investigating possible          defects leading to aberrant apoptosis or phagocyte          function andor aberrant antigen expression in systemic          autoimmune diseases                          Kinetics of degradation of golgins and generation          of apoptotic fragments          Although only welldefined apoptotic fragments of          golgin and giantin not of golgin and golgin          were detected after  or  hours of incubation with STS          total disappearance of intact proteins was detected with          all Golgi autoantigens and complete blockage was observed          in the presence of zVADfmk These results suggested          that there might be differences in the kinetics of          degradation among the golgins with golgin and          golgin perhaps being more sensitive to proteolysis and          being targeted very early during apoptosis While the          absence of apoptotic fragments for golgin and          golgin suggests that total degradation of these          proteins occurred without generation of intermediate          proteaseresistant fragments it cannot be ruled out that          the intact proteins were released from apoptotic cells or          that their apoptotic fragments were not recognized by          autoantibodies          In the present study Jurkat cells were relatively          sensitive to the treatment with STS such that the          kinetics of degradation of different golgins relative to          that of PARP could not be accurately differentiated          Since HEp cells grown as a monolayer were observed to          be more resistant to apoptosis compared with Jurkat          cells we used HEp cells to investigate more precisely          the relative kinetics of degradation for the native          golgins during apoptosis          An identical pattern of fragmentation was essentially          observed for all the Golgi autoantigens examined except          that the overall kinetics of native protein degradation          was slower data not shown The integrity of native          golgin and golgin in which apoptotic fragments          were not detected was almost completely maintained at           hours after the addition of STS data not shown In          contrast native golgin and giantin were degraded          into their respective fragments  hours after the          addition of STS The processing of golgin and giantin          occurred as early as that for PARP suggesting that these          proteins are cleaved during the onset of apoptosis data          not shown Cleavage of golgin and giantin may thus          play a potentially important role in the early stages of          apoptosis          Although we did not determine which golgins are          substrates for specific caspases further studies aimed          at defining the caspases responsible for golgin cleavage          the cleavage sites and the biological consequences of          these cleavages should provide important insights into          the possible role of some of the Golgi autoantigens in          apoptosis                            Conclusion        The present study has shown overall morphologic changes        of the Golgi complex during apoptosis and necrosis with        distinct fragmentation patterns of its associated        autoantigens We propose that cleavage of golgin and        giantin may play a role in early events in apoptosis We        also speculate that Golgi fragmentation in cell death might        participate in sustaining autoantibody response to the        Golgi complex in aberrant disease states characterized by        unregulated cell death resulting from injury or infection        or defective clearance of dying cells                    Abbreviations        AGA  antiGolgi complex autoantibodies H          O           hydrogen peroxide PARP
