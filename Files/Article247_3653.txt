                                 British Airways Unfriendly Skies                        Over the years advertisers have tried all kinds of tactics to attractcustomers and more recently those tactics have seemed to cover the fullspectrum of the possible including the utterly oblique Infinitis firstcampaign the willfully tacky Mentos the memorableformemorabilityssakeOutpostcoms flying gerbils and ravenous wolves and the selfloathingSegas Japanese ads for Dreamcast which I wrote about here last week But in one of its new ads British Airways of all companiesseems to be pioneering a still relatively uncharted strategy mocking its owncustomers and its most lucrative customers at that            The ad is set in an elementaryschool or whatever the British callelementary school classroom where the kids are engaged in a furious game ofmusical chairs Its basic premise is that certain kinds of people end up doingcertain kinds of jobs when they grow up which is certainly an unsurprisingenough premise And for the first  seconds or so of the ad as differentchildren find seats in different ways and thereby demonstrate their eventualfates as the camera zooms in on the individual kids their eventualprofessions appear on screen the ad too is unsurprising            Then a boywith curly hair and glasses I think though Ive seen the adonly a couple of timesrealizes that hes been frozen out that all the seatshave been taken and hes lost His response is to throw a tantrum and hestomps around complainingpresumably at the top of his lungs though the adis silent except for the announcers voiceoverat this unjust turn of eventsAnd onscreen appears the word CEO            The camera pans down the occupied seats to alight upon a freshscrubbedEnglish lass who stands up and lets the peevish boy sit down much to hisselfsatisfied delight The ad closes with the girl in the foreground smilingat the camera because she is of course the perfect future British Airwaysflight attendant            The our flight attendants are generous souls who will sacrifice anythingfor the pleasure and comfort of their charges message is not odd here But theCEOs are spoiled children whose main talent consists of yelling and screaminguntil they get what they want even at the cost of others wellbeing isstrange particularly since all the children in the game who have got seatsappear to have got them by dint of hard work andor sharp tactics The CEO hasfailed because hes not very good and succeeds only by crying The only waythe ad could have painted a less savory picture of corporate chieftains wouldhave been if the teacher had forced one of the other students to stand up Butthen that would have defeated the whole flight attendants are angels part ofthe ad            Whats especially interesting about this is that British Airways is in themidst of a wellpublicized slimming down figurative and literal since BA isgoing to be flying smaller planes thats designed to make highend customers alarger percentage of the airlines business This ad with its faintly populistair doesnt seem to fit the new strategy all that well But who knows MaybeBA has figured out that what CEOs really want is for someone to see them asthey truly are and then say Hey its OK After all in the end the spoiledkid does get the chair and a smile from the pretty girl
