                    Introduction        The epithelial component of normal and noninvasive        breast tissues is normally surrounded by a layer of        myoepithelial ME cells whose absence or disruption is an        absolute prerequisite for tumor invasion and metastasis            ME cells are not easily identifiable in        hematoxylineosin HEstained breast tissue sections        as they are often indistinguishable from subjacent        myofibroblastic cells in the stroma Immunohistochemical        staining for smooth muscle actin SMA has been routinely        used to assist in the identification of ME cells            However we and others have repeatedly noted that about         of morphologically recognizable ME cells in        HEstained sections fail to display SMA        immunoreactivity      We attempted to assess whether        these SMAnegative cells also lack the expression of eight        additional markers that are supposed to present exclusively        or preferentially at ME cells                    Materials and methods                  Case selection          Formalinfixed paraffinembedded tissue blocks from          female patients with breast lesions were retrieved from          files of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology          Consecutive sections at  m thickness were cut and          placed on positively charged microscopic slides A total          of  cases with distinct ME cells defined as a          continuous layer of spindle or cuboidshaped cells that          overlie the basement membrane and encircle epithelial          cells were selected for this study Among the  cases          all contained noninvasive lesions including ductal and          lobular carcinoma           in situ and sclerosing adenosis          and a few cases had invasive components                          Markers and reagents          Nine antibodies reported to present exclusively or          preferentially at ME cells were selected for this study                                          Table  these included antibodies against SMA          smooth muscle myosin heavy chain SMMHC CD          calponin protease inhibitor  maspin Wilms tumor          WT and cytokeratins   and  CK CK and          CK Other reagents including the secondary antibody          detection kits and chromogen kits were purchased from          Vector Laboratories Inc Burlingame CA Digestion          enzymes recommended for antigen retrieval were bought          from Sigma St Louis MO A microwave oven and pressure          cooker designated for antigen retrieval along with          retrieval solutions were purchased from Biocare Medical          Walnut Creek CA                          Immunohistochemical staining          A preliminary study was performed to optimize the          immunostaining condition for all antibodies selected          First each of the nine antibodies was tested strictly in          accordance with the manufacturers recommended protocol          including the methods of antigen retrieval and the length          of the primary antibody incubation time Then each          antibody was tested with our published protocol which          involves an overnight incubation of deparaffinized          sections at C in the retrieval solution and an          incubation for  hours or overnight of the primary          antibody at about C     Two adjacent sections          stained by using our protocol and the manufacturers          recommended protocols were compared for specificity and          sensitivity As our protocol consistently yielded          stronger and more distinct staining for all the          antibodies the final staining for all the  cases with          SMA and a double immunostaining with additional markers          in selected cases see below were performed with our          published protocol                              Double immunohistochemical staining          All HEstained and immunostained sections were          reviewed independently by at least two investigators All          ducts lined by at least  epithelial cells were          examined and three cases were found to contain ducts          that displayed morphologically distinct ME cell layers in          HEstained sections but ME cells in at least          onethird of the layer or the entire layer were devoid of          SMA staining Eight consecutive sections from each of the          three selected cases were used for a double          immunostaining with our published protocols               In brief all eight sections were first immunostained for          SMA with a black chromogen Each section was then stained          for one of the eight additional ME markers with a red          chromogen The same ducts with SMAnegative ME cells were          examined for the expression of other markers In          addition sections from all three cases were          immunostained for estrogen receptor ER and CK to          exclude the possibility that these SMAnegative cells          might be epithelial in nature                            Results and discussion        Results showed that all three cases spanned a        morphologic spectrum ranging from columnar cell hyperplasia        to ductal carcinoma         in situ  Case  columnar cell        hyperplasia contained two ducts of interest lined by about         epithelial cells surrounded by morphologically distinct        ME cell layers on the HEstained section Fig a        The ME cells in about twothirds of the ME layer showed        distinct and strong SMA immunostaining whereas the cells        in about onethird of the layer were devoid of SMA        immunostaining Fig b The SMApositive and SMAnegative        cells were morphologically indistinguishable on        HEstained sections In double immunostained sections        these SMAnegative cells were also negative for SMMHC        WT CD and calponin Fig cdef However these        SMAnegative cells were positive for maspin CK CK and        CK Fig ghij        Cases  and  contained ductal carcinoma         in situ  of intermediate grade and        low grade respectively The ducts were surrounded by        morphologically distinct ME cell layers in HEstained        sections Fig a These ME cell layers were attenuated        consisting of elongated spindle cells with dark and        compressed nuclei The entire ME cell layer was devoid of        SMA immunostaining Fig b In double immunostained        sections these SMAnegative cells were also devoid of        distinct immunostaining for any of the additional eight        markers Fig cdef        The SMAnegative cells in all three cases showed        distinct negativity to ER and CK in sharp contrast with        the overlying epithelial cells that showed strong ER and        CK positivities data not shown The distribution of        these SMAnegative ME cells seemed to be independent of the        ductal size length and architecture        Our findings are consistent with those of a recent study        showing that a vast majority of the ME cells in both normal        and ductal carcinoma         in situ displayed distinct        immunostaining to p SMMHC and calponin whereas a        single or a cluster of a few ME cells in some ducts failed        to show immunoreactivity to all these three markers            However our study differs from this study    and        previous studies     in four aspects first the        SMAnegative cells were segmented accounting for at least        onethird or all of the ME cells in involved ducts second        we tested for more ME cell markers third the SMAnegative        cells assessed were morphologically similar to their        adjacent SMApositive neighbors on HEstained        sections fourth our focus is directed toward the        elucidation of the detailed immunohistochemical profile of        these SMAnegative cells identified in  of  examined        cases The distribution of different ME markers among        normal benign and malignant breast lesions in the        remaining cases will be presented separately In our study        p was replaced with WT for three main reasons first        p is a nuclear protein which is not easily identifiable        in attenuated or compressed ME cells second previous        studies have shown that this protein is also expressed in        MEcellderived neoplasms and tumors with squamous cell        differentiation     third our preliminary study had        showed that WT had the same subcellular localization but        seemed to be more specific for ME cells compared with p                   The mechanism of the loss of myoepithelial markers in        some of the ME cells is unknown but could result from the        dynamic and reciprocal interactions between epithelial and        ME cells It has been documented that a variety of        proteolytic enzymes produced by malignant epithelial cells        could have substantial impacts on the physical integrity or        functions of the subjacent ME cells and the basement        membrane       In contrast ME cells could        influence the biological behavior of subjacent epithelial        cells Our recent studies have revealed the colocalization        of maspin and WT exclusively in mammary ME cells            In a vast majority of cases the expression of these two        proteins decreases linearly with tumor progression and the        loss of these proteins or focal disruptions in the ME cell        layers leads to a significantly higher cell proliferation        in the subjacent epithelial cells      In addition        these changes in ME cells could result from effects of        certain chemical compounds        It has been reported that the exposure to        lambdacarrageenan could specifically result in filament        disassembly and loss of ME cells     In contrast        exposure to oxytocin could substantially enhance ME cell        differentiation and proliferation in mouse breasts            In addition these SMAnegative ME cells might be newly        formed through stemcellmediated proliferation and are in        the transition to a terminally differentiated status Our        previous studies on animal models have shown that        intercalated duct cells in adult rat submandibular glands        are the common progenitor for both the acinar and granular        duct cells      A recent study in human breast has        revealed that CKpositive cells are capable of giving rise        to both glandular and ME cell lineages     In both        cases the intermediate cells showed an unusual        immunostaining pattern for several proteins             The total loss of all nine ME cell immunophenotypic        markers suggests that these ME cells have genetic and        biochemical properties differing from their SMApositive        counterparts The significance and consequence of these        changes in ME cells are unknown However given that the        disruption of the ME cell layer and basement membrane is an        absolute prerequisite for tumor invasion and metastasis        these alterations in ME cells might affect the biological        behavior of the epithelial cells making them prone to        progression Our assumption is in agreement with our        previous findings which have revealed that focal        disruptions of ME cell layers could lead to a significantly        higher proliferation rate in subjacent epithelial cells             Our assumption is also supported by a recent        study showing that normal and tumorderived ME cells differ        substantially in their ability to interact with luminal        breast epithelial cells for polarity and basement membrane        deposition     Further studies are currently in        progress to elucidate the biological behavior and genetic        profile of epithelial cells immediately subjacent to these        SMAnegative ME cells                    Conclusions        A subset of morphologically identifiable ME cells lacks        the expression of nine corresponding immunophenotypic        markers suggesting that like the epithelial cells ME        cells might also be subject to different normal and        pathological alterations and that alterations in ME cells        might significantly affect the functions and biological        behavior of the adjacent epithelial cells                    Competing interests        None
