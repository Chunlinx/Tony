        yeah i think um this is a tough subject because uh when you come from two different parts of the country uh the political views are really different i uh i i guess ive had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues   uhhuh   i guess like i like and though nothing i guess nothing is as as awful as abortion but like gun control and uh day care and things like that and there are some very different views uh of the people connected with the program which i thought was really interesting you know   well now you say you say two different parts of the country what are are you are you referring to yourself are you   well yeah well being in in in Baltimore see Maryland is um is sort a um is probably liberalism  is a is a hub of liberalism  you know compared to the country uh you know very um   uhhuh   in in many ways uh very liberal very similar to New England though Pennsylvania and New York uh i  arent actually as liberal Maryland is a very liberal uh state so so where where here we have um we have gun control laws we probably have some of the strictest gun controls laws in the nation and most people in Maryland vote for that   umhum   you know so it really is a different um   uh well of course uh you talk gun controls down here in Texas and youre asking to be lynched   yeah thats thats true i talked to a i had to talk about gun control with somebody and i talked with a woman who actually you know had had had just purchased a gun that day and was going target shooting you know and it was very different it was a whole different view its really um   hm umhum   this has opened my eyes to thinking you know at one time i just sat here and thought well how can anybody believe that because id really never met people that did and now i talk to people that do so thats its really interesting   well its very true now im a a New Yorker by birth   umhum   although i claim Florida as my home now uh i have two sons living down there but but i also have two sons living elsewhere one in Tennessee one in Mississippi but i lived in Tennessee in Florida for ten years and i kind of like it down there but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far   umhum yeah   i think uh well in your words they were a little bit too liberal     yeah isnt it funny   i mean they permitted they i believe if im correct i believe they permitted to carrying concealed weapons   umhum   but they uh  quickly did away with it i think in the next session they they uh modified it   hm yeah   but its still legal to own or possess weapons in uh uh Florida   yeah well you can possess them here too but they have to be theyre registered and uh like the the the Brady Bill thats currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here in gun control avenues and um   the the the one week uh uh seven day delay   you have the seven day waiting period   uhhuh   yeah thats uh thats   well i dont mind that too much now im im with the NRA myself and uh uh really the only the objection we have   yeah   is uh you you give a little and next thing you know uh somebodys somebodys trying to take more   yeah thats true thats very true thats and thats the way most i guess most of the um the political organizations work you know the same i know the abortion issue with right to life and right to choose and   yeah   and both of them are uh both want the extent of extremes so that they dont give anything for a balance you know theres theres always that difficulty   well then tell me do you consider yourself a liberal     um i would say im probably liberal yeah   well let me ask you this then how is your what is your feeling   yeah sure   about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the American flag   well ill tell you i i think you know if they if they didnt give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag it would never happen do you know what i mean   um   its only because they make a big stink over it but i i guess actually i believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag i guess thats their opportunity their their their right in the sense of freedom of speech but i i would never   well now wait a minute there there you just said it   yeah   its their right by freedom freedom of speech what does speech have to do with burning a flag   yeah well its freedom that they i think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to and i uh uh the the the whole aspect of being able to display your uh your ideas you know the what the country stands on America stands on is that they can do that uh though i would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself i i i think uh you know but i i still what the stands flag stands for i guess to me is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show their opinion then they should be allowed uh   now uh well i i still go back to   unless the burning unless the actual fire hinders somebodys health and wellbeing you know but i i think thats i guess thats i think thats my opinion yeah i guess you feel differently   then would you condone the burning of the capitol building   uh no but i think thats thats the its thats taxpayers money if somebody buys their own flag and and burns it thats fine but that thats you know thats destruction and of of uh public property and whatever   uh then you dont draw a line between public property and uh uh uh what a public uh symbol   no i dont know i guess the symbolism oh i think what America stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government   uh yeah but here again i go back to the second amendment you can disagree by speech freedom of speech   uh i think thats whats made democracy yeah umhum yeah   which has nothing to do with action   well thats thats true yeah but i think i i guess   now i am i am adamantly against that   yeah i i guess i guess the idea you know they always keep saying like the framers um there uh of one of the Republican the appointees for the judicial the judicial bench and they always talk about that they they feel that this person believes in the framing of the constitution what the original framers the ideals the original framers set down and um   umhum   i believe that the idea of burning the flag is is in my understanding of how it was framed is that you this country the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government and you can display that   yeah umhum   uh i guess yeah i guess and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and whatever i i think that thats viable  um as long as its your flag and and youve made your your point i think yeah yeah because realistically like for you for you you dont think its right   no   and i would never do it i i love this country too much and that symbol means a lot to me   umhum   um but i guess its just one of those things where if they if thats whats something if a need for them you know   well here again we uh even though you uh physically you agree with me you you wouldnt do it yourself   yeah yes no   but nevertheless you maintain that its it is the right of of any citizen to burn the symbol of their country   right   yeah umhum   uh um so long as its their possession okay youre youre thats fine up to there except that uh the what that flag symbolizes is uh uh is this country   umhum   and i used to know as a Boy Scout but all i remember was the red in the flag represented blood that that was shed to to create this country and to maintain it   yeah   and to me thats uh uh a a black eye to every man that ever  uh carried a weapon or killed for his country   i agree there too i agree with you there too i i the um i i its i find it you know personally disgusting but i dont think that i dont think that uh   hm umhum   we have a right to stop somebody from that you know the same i dont know i guess i get i get all all mixed up inside when   its very easy to do   yeah it gets when its uh its an emotional issue and you sit and you try and think about it logically and and and you know you try to say to yourself now emotionally this is a disgusting thing uh but logically um even you know for instance the prolife prochoice movement uh you know i dont know anybody that actually supports abortion but they would vote prochoice   umhum   because you know thats just a disgusting thing you know somebody an abortion means its somebodys in trouble and that its an awful thing   well i think it should be permitted under certain circumstances circumstances   you know but yeah but it thats uh thats what i mean see most but but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing and it evokes an emotional response i think thats the hardest thing i dont know if i could ever be a judge because some things emotionally just arent you know   umhum well tell me has it ever been decided when when is a uh fetus a human   no no i think the um sometimes i guess what did i read recently the um the the uh Christian uh point is is always the point of well its at conception but then um a friend of mines a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term and theres no concept of conception in medicine or biology   hm   so then that so that throws out that idea it makes it a religious discussion then so its i dont know its very its its uh you know its a its a topsy turvy world and its really something how um political ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within um   or they on their own within the own uh society it can vary   within a yeah and how yeah how itll sway from one extreme one extreme to another   umhum   uh i think that uh you know i i just read something i think in Time magazine uh about about um protest on
