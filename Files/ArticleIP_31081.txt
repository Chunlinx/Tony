                                  Tarzan            Carl Jung once observed that it is easier todiscern the presence of archetypes from the collective subconscious in works ofpulp fiction by writers such as H Rider Haggard than it is in literarymasterpieces If only Jung had put Edgar Rice Burroughs on hisdepthpsychologists couch Burroughs was the George Lucas of his day creatingin Tarzan and other characters beings as profoundly mythicaland asstereotypically superficialas Darth Vader Like Luke Skywalkers saga thetale of Tarzan mixes and matches motifs from the archetypehaunted dreamtime ofhumanity anatomized by Jung and Jungs disciple Joseph Campbell The tale ofthe prince raised in secret by adopted parents King Arthur Luke Skywalker isfused with the story of the feral child raised by animals Romulus and RemusEnkidu Mowgli Pecos Bill in the romance of the orphaned English lord raisedby a foster family of African apes            The fact that Tarzan is really an EnglishlordLord Greystoke to be precisewas central to Burroughs conception ofhis character In the pulp fiction of Burroughs as in pulp fiction of anyperiod timeless archetypes rub shoulders with the vulgar prejudices of thewriter and his audience In the works of Burroughs todays raceclassgendertheorists can easily find a key to the racial social and sexual anxieties ofearly  th century white American men and boys When the firstTarzan books were published the British Empire ruled the waves the UnitedStates had recently joined the ranks of imperial powers and white supremacywas the norm in the United States and throughout the world Confidence in theinnate superiority of the Caucasian raceand within that race of itsAngloSaxon variantcoexisted with paranoia about the yellow peril and blacksavagery            The two major charactersin the oeuvre of Edgar Rice Burroughs are Tarzan of the Apes and JohnCarter of Mars Although John Carter never made it in Hollywood the way thathis cousin in the jungle jockstrap did it is worth reviving him to make apoint Tarzan and John Carter were both exemplars of AngloSaxonmasculinityTarzan the heir to an aristocratic English family and JohnCarter an upperclass Virginian by birth The Tarzan and Carter stories can beviewed as experimentstake a member of the AngloSaxon ruling class strip himof all his advantages and put him in a radically different environment inorder that the innate superiority of his breed may be demonstrated Whether inAfrica the symbol of precivilized savagery or on an old desiccated Mars thesymbol of overrefinement and cultural exhaustion the AngloSaxon man provesthat he is royalty Tarzan becomes Lord of the Jungle John Carter weds thePrincess of Mars Space in Burroughs is a metaphor for time Tarzan and JohnCarter represent the era of AngloAmerican civilization at the midpointbetween prehistoric barbarism and posthistoric decadence            Burroughs genius can be seen in the way that he redeemedthe imagery of savagery for his AngloSaxon apeman In the mythology of whitesupremacy even before Charles Darwin black Africans and other nonwhites wereassimilated to apes Thomas Jefferson in his Notes on the State ofVirginia  finds credible the rumor that African women mate withorangutans In much  th  and early  th century pulpfiction American Indians and black Americans have a mystical rapport withanimals which author and audience alike understood arose from their proximityon the evolutionary scale But Burroughs Tarzan is closer to the animals thanthe black Africans who live nearby The Great White Hope is at once morecivilized and more savage than the nativeshe is the Lone Rangerand Tonto With Tarzan monopolizing the highest and lowest rungs of theChain of Being the natives find themselves deprived of the one asset thatracist mythology attributed to them closeness to the animals leaving themwithout any particular function in the economy of kitsch literature except tobe rescued by Tarzan from rogue elephants and the occasional witch doctor            When first published theTarzan stories provided a largely American audience of white men and boys witha fantasy version of the ultimate White Guy the virile aristocrat who farfrom being effete and degenerate could go Ape as well as Ascot Something likethis vision inspired Theodore Roosevelt the asthmatic Yankee patrician whoturned himself into a cowboy and as an expresident nearly died whileexploring a tributary of the Amazon in Brazil in an adventure that might havebeen scripted by Burroughs George Busha professed admirer of TRis theTarzan

Bushcontinues to battle the Wimp Factor Perhaps he should swing from vines aswell By contrast George W a rich kid who unlike his father sat out thewar of his generation is Boy            The Tarzan mythos then depends on a balance oftensionsbetween Tarzan the ApeMan and Lord Greystoke between England andAfrica between civilization and savagery Play down one side of the equationand the meaning of this whole system of preWorld War II social stereotypescollapses            This is what happenedwhen Hollywood got hold of the Tarzan story Beginning with the JohnnyWeissmuller films the jungle began eclipsing the English manor Tarzan becamesimply a feral child a white Mowgli The genre changed to pastoral Tarzan andJane became the equivalents of the innocent shepherds and shepherdesses ofHellenistic Greek and Renaissance pastoral fiction striving to preserve theirnatural idyll from corruption by civilization Pastoral Tarzan need not be anEnglish lord He need not even be white A black or brown or Asian Tarzan woulddefeat the whole point of the Burroughs mythos but would not be out of place inthe Hollywood or TV versions            Disneys new animated Tarzan is the politically correctheir of several generations of Hollywood Tarzansa facsimile of a facsimileGone is the social Darwinist worldview that underpinned the original In theprologue we see Tarzans parents but we do not learn they are titled Indeedfrom their facility at assembling a tree house we might think that they arenot Lord and Lady Greystoke but Mr and Mrs Robinson as in Crusoe or SwissFamily The embarrassing problem of what to do with the natives in apostracist age is solved by eliminating the natives altogether Disneysgorillas live in a jungle uninhabited by human beings until Europeansintrude            The Disneyfied Tarzan issuch a wimp that he is not allowed to kill anything or anybody although ourPaleolithic pacifist is permitted to use martial arts techniques inselfdefense The two villains of the movie are a homicidal and simiocidalcheetah and an English hunterthe Evil White Male without which no PC epicwould be complete But when the time comes for them to die both do themselvesin accidentally while fighting Tarzan The cheetah falls atop a spearhead thatTarzan happens to be holding and the Englishman inadvertently hangs himself onjungle vines This

old and feeble white men aretolerable decide to renounce civilized society for the jungle There by happycoincidence the two alpha males Kerchak the bull ape and the evil Englishhunter are gone
