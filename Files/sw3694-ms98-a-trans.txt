             yeah   okay  im sorry speaking of air pollution im  coughing like a dog now um        im not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly i find it hard to believe that a lot of the hair sprays and things that we use cause the air pollution and it just doesnt seem like   yeah it it   but i guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home you know and it its kind of dangerous   yeah yeah thats true uh i dont know we live um   umhum   well im close to Salt Lake and theres mountains um you know all around but sometimes i i think tend to hold a little bit of it in you know really its its fairly clean   umhum oh yeah   um i think its a fairly clean city compared to some but you have quite as   but you think the mountains and the are kind of a barrier hum thats a   yeah i think sometimes it seems to be but   thats an interesting thought   but uh anyway i dont know i know theres a lot of plants here when i drive down you know along the just along the freeway theres a lot of plants that theyre burning things and   umhum umhum um here in Texas i know a lot of the pretty much every place here is is relatively flat and so i would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of a like a smog problem or something like that im not sure   oh uhhuh yeah we we have a real fog problem um the last few years just in through December and January it it really it is foggy and seems to just um   huh   its kind of like it it just stays for a month  its quite foggy but uh   umhum   jeez i dont i dont know what else i know cars   i i guess yeah i guess ive never really uh thought about the fact that like in California they they have a lot of smog problems     uhhuh   and its real hilly there so that is probably something that plays a big factor  i think probably just uh a lot of factories   yeah     um you know they have the smoke stacks i guess you call them i dont know what you call them and different things like that   uhhuh yeah thats thats what i see burning a lot and im not exactly sure what theyre burning i know uhhuh theres some oil companies and and im sure that that contributes a lot just the burning of the chemicals   umhum umhum arent they supposed to be coming out with some sort of uh special gas or something that doesnt emit certain chemicals or something   oh i dont know i havent i havent heard that i know uh i dont know how your emissions test is on your cars or anything but i know i think they they differ from state to state   hum oh okay   but um you know thats been a new thing in the last few years and i guess some cars are a lot worse than others i think those uh   umhum   what are they the i know a a Rabbits one diesel the diesel cars yeah they they seem to put out quite a bit   uhhuh the diesel oh yeah   i dont know a lot of people with diesels  unless its a truck you know   huh oh   but uh   oh well do you um are you working for T I   no i dont i work i work in Waco at a TV station so my mother works at TI so thats how i   oh oh oh uhhuh and thats how you got involved yeah no we we have um uh my husbands sister lives in Dallas actually and they kind of got it us involved that way   yeah yeah do you work at T I oh okay okay oh okay thats interesting   yeah but well i dont i dont know much           what else causes air pollution um noise     yeah noise   noise causes air pollution and noise pollution   yeah ive got speaking of noise you can probably hear my little     yeah  thats why i thought of it i thought   yes hes he is quite noisy yes jeez i dont know i know that um   hum how funny   dont dumps  you know where you dump all your trash in the they uh yeah and im sure that does i know theyre always churning that up and i i think they burn a lot there too i   oh yeah landfills yeah we just yeah we just had a big uh thing here in Waco theyre needing to open a new landfill or to expand onto the old landfill and uh it its really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill dont want it expanded because theyre thinking that their water is going to be contaminated somehow and so they   oh well  yeah i dont think id id like that you know we um when weve taken things to the dump just   yeah   the dump that is uh you know closest to us theres some houses around there and i know that on windy days you know theyre always moving the the trash over to different spots and theyve got those big bulldozers and you can see the dust   umhum oh yeah umhum   flying and and im sure that their homes are really quite dusty and   and one one of the big concerns is they have a theres a school right across the highway from the landfill yeah so the parents were really really upset   oh is there worried about the their kids getting huh   umhum yeah and theyve theyve been fighting over it for the last year and they just now approved it so they were gonna try an appeal or something
