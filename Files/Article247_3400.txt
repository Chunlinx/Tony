                                 Will There Be Life After Greenspan                        If you blinked you missed it but for a short while yesterday morning thestock and bond markets dived after a rumor that Alan Greenspan was resigninghit the Street The story was quickly  well it wasnt exactly refutedsince Greenspan didnt say actually say Im not resigning but it wasrejected as unlikely and both markets rebounded nicely            Fleeting as it was the momentary episode of selling panic was interestingfor a couple of reasons In the first place the rumor had all the makings of astory that was being floated by someone who had taken a large short positionin other words who was wagering that the market was going down and wastrying to knock the market down after it opened strongly Theres somethingweirdly oldfashioned about the idea that a big Wall Street insider could sayPssst Hey buddy I hear Als on his way out and send stocks tumbling Itfits our ideas of the s when the market was incredibly manipulable oreven of the s more than it does the late s            But the truth is that in the short run markets can occasionally be pushedespecially when so many decisions to buy or sell are keyed off what everyoneelse in the market is doing Chain reactions are not much harder to start infact given how quickly price moves get noticed they may be easier than theywere  years ago            All that notwithstanding the interesting thing about the Greenspanresignation rumor was that it raised an obvious question Would it reallymatter As Jacob Weisberg just pointed out in  Ballot Box Steve Forbes is apparently the only American who doesnt thinkGreenspan has done a terrific job as Fed chairman And most of us would behappy to have Greenspan stay in office even after his current term expires inthe middle of next year But its interesting to note that in the past coupleof months there have been more than a few voicesincluding those of economistsGreg Mankiw and Robert Barrsuggesting that Greenspan has been more thebeneficiary of good economic fundamentals than the creator of them            That position may be a bit overstated particularly since Greenspan hasshown an unusual ability to let his thinking on inflation productivity andthe economys possible growth rate evolve in response to changing data But theessential point that the soundness of this economy does not depend onGreenspans presence at the head of the Fed is right That might not be thecase if Greenspans successor were either an inflation dove like WilliamGreider or a permabear like Jim Grant But whoever would succeed Greenspanwould be nothing of the sort He or she would be in a word Greenspanianstill concerned about the possibility of an overheating economy but alsoconvinced that important technological changes have allowed this economy togrow faster than in the past without sparking inflation            If anything in fact the bond market should have rallied on news thatGreenspan might be stepping down since he has long since stopped beingparanoid enough for bondholders who seem perpetually convinced that the UnitedStates is about to become Brazil There are certainly Fed governors out therewho would be far more likely to raise interest rates aggressively at the firsthint of price pressures than Greenspan            The momentary selloff though was not driven by any rational considerationof what Greenspans departure might mean Instead everyone assumes thatGreenspans resignation will knock down the market so Greenspansresignationor rumors of itknocks down the market But this is not thesummer of  or the fall of  We dont need Greenspan to reassure us thatthe world isnt going to fall apart anymore When he leaves the market willhiccup But it would be surprising if it did more than that
