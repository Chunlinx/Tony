It is very seldom that I take notice of anyarticle that even mentions my father This one caught my eye not only becauseof the ridiculous picture of him on the front but also the numerous pages ofincompetent work            I havegrown to know my fathers faults over the years and yes in many cases peopleare blind to them I for one think they should be Never in my life have Iseen a man so dedicated I do not mention only one thing he is particularlydedicated to because I see him on a daytoday basis going to work and doinga job that only he could ever do He never ever leaves the house beforecompleting a daily routine that he has done every day for as long as Ive knownhim Part of the routine includes bringing coffee to my mother every morning tostart her day making sure the house is in order kissing us all goodbye andthen taking care of himself Although I dont think any of ourhome life is even any of your business I had to comment on the fact that youquoted him as saying he was a bad father and husband If in fact he said thatI am sorry He is a wonderful father My sister and I would be the onlypeople to ever know if that is true Printing it in your little articlewas for lack of better words stupid I also know my father loves to do amillion things at once That fact holds true wherever we go Even on slowlaidback family getaways where no reporter who is trying to get somerecognition can follow us When he reaches the last thing on the list it maynot be done to the best of his unsurpassable ability but it wasnt due to anyfault of his own He is an amazing man it is true but he gets tired like thebest of them do You can understand that cant you You seem to have slept alittle bit while you were writing this article And you can quote me when I saythat this article was an insult to your magazine             Elizabeth HelenClaire Gates                                       Interesting Conflict Over Conflict of Interest                        InMichael Kinsleys Ethics Upside Down he notes that there are two possible reasonswhy conflict of interest is a bad thing for journalists             The conflict causessome kind of personal advantage to distort either your perception of the truthor your willingness to honestly state what you perceive In other words itamounts to a bribe Or  the conflict reveals a previously hidden incentive ortendency to misperceive or misstate the truth            But Ithink he misses an important reason Though the conflict may not reveal apreviously hidden incentive as in  it may create one That is thejournalists aim before the conflict may have been to present the truth asaccurately as he couldwhether additionally inserting his own opinion ornotwithout any hidden incentive or tendency to misstate the truth presentBut the conflict itself might create such a tendency or incentive Icannot judge whether Stuart Taylor fell prey to this possibility But hecertainly could have been instilled with a tendency to misrepresent in order toplease a possible employer Lastly his incentive need not be financial abribe It could be any one or combination of a number of things includingpower prestige or even misplaced ethical values values that he thought wereright even if they were in fact not Again all this is not to say thatTaylor is guilty of such an offense But it should not be so quickly ruledout             RichGoldberg
