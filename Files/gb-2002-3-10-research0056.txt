                    Background        Organisms must be able to respond to their environment        to survive In plants mechanisms have evolved for sensing        and responding to hormonal and environmental signals both        biotic for example pathogens and abiotic for example        heat cold light and saltdrought stresses To elicit a        response the perceived signal must be conveyed to the        cellular machinery Messengers such as Ca  cyclic        nucleotides cAMP and cGMP hydrogen peroxide H          O           and nitric oxide transduce the        perceived stimulus to proteins that initiate a response Ca        is one of the important messengers that mediate plant        responses to hormones developmental cues and external        stimuli     It is implicated in regulating such        diverse and fundamental cellular process as cytoplasmic        streaming thigmotropism gravitropism cell division cell        elongation cell differentiation cell polarity        photomorphogenesis and plant defense and stress responses            The Ca concentration in the cytoplasm Ca          cyt  is maintained in the nanomolar        range approximately  nM whereas the concentration        in organelles and cell wall is in the millimolar range             Several signals hormonal abiotic and biotic        have been shown to cause transient elevation of Ca          cyt       This transient        increase in Ca          cyt is sensed by Ca binding proteins            The conformation of the Ca binding protein        changes on binding Ca  resulting in modulation of its        activity or its ability to interact with other proteins or        nucleic acids and modulate their function or activity The        Ca sensors in plants can be broadly divided into four        major classes    calmodulin CAM class A CAMlike        and other EFhandcontaining Ca binding proteins class        B Ca regulated protein kinases class C and Ca        binding proteins without EFhand motifs class D        Three classes A B and C contain proteins with        EFhand motifs This motif is a helixloophelix structure        that binds a single Ca ion   The loop consists of         residues with the pattern XYZYXZ The residues X        Y Z Y X Z participate in binding Ca and the        intervening residues are represented by asterisks  Asp        or Asn is usually found at X and Y Asp Asn or Ser at Z        a variety of residues at Y usually Asp Asn or Ser at        X but this position is more variable and usually Glu at        Z   The helixloophelix is only  residues long        the E helix being residues  the loop  and the        F helix    Residue  is often Glu E and a        Gly at residue  is highly conserved as is Ile at residue         It has been reported that some of the EFhand domains        do not bind Ca          In quiescent cells proteins with EFhands are in an        apoprotein form when Ca          cyt increases they bind Ca and change        their conformation Some EFhands can also bind Mg for        example the third and fourth EFhands of troponin C bind        Ca Mg  whereas the first and second EFhands are Ca        specific   Ca Mg discrimination relies on the        affinities of the EFhands for these cations which is        dependent on the types of aminoacid residues in the        binding loop           EFhands can be present in proteins with no other known        domains as is the case for CAM or in proteins with other        domains such as a protein kinase In most cases EFhand        motifs are found in pairs and proteins with four EFhands        usually have two domains with a pair of EFhands in each        Calpain is an exception to the pairing rule It comprises a        large subunit with five EFhands at the carboxyl terminus        and a small subunit that also has five EFhands The two        unpaired hands in these subunits pair to form a heterodimer          The large superfamily of EFhand proteins has been        divided into  subfamilies on the basis of differences in        number and organization of EFhand pairs aminoacid        sequences within or outside the motifs affinity for Ca        andor selectivity and affinity for target proteins          Of the subfamilies  consist of a unique single        member The EFhand proteins used in the classification by        Nakayama         et al   include proteins from        animals plants fungi and protists with plants        represented in only nine of the  subfamilies        Several EFhand proteins have been identified in the        model plant         Arabidopsis thaliana including        several CAMs      a Ca binding protein        CaBP  touchinduced proteins TCH and TCH          centrin   Ca dependent protein kinases CPKs          calcineurin Blike proteinssaltoverlysensitive        family CBLsSOS    fimbrins   respiratory        burst oxidase homologs Rbohs    a phospholipase           channel proteins    a NADHdependent        glutamate dehydrogenase   a protein phosphatase           a NaClinducible protein   and a Ca binding        protein in pollen   Some have been identified by        screening with animal homologs whereas others have been        identified by sequencing the genes induced in response to        biotic and abiotic signals The first method would miss        plantspecific EFhand proteins and the second method        relies on comprehensive analysis of all genes that might be        induced or activated by various signals With the recent        completion of the sequencing of the         A thaliana genome the first plant        genome to be sequenced new methods of identifying genes        encoding proteins with specific domains have become        possible   Insight into the function of the proteins        can be gained by identifying and characterizing EFhand        proteins encoded in the         Arabidopsis genome Classification of        the EFhandcontaining proteins can be a starting point in        identification of Ca binding proteins that might be        involved in a particular cell process With this in mind        we searched the         Arabidopsis genome for genes encoding        proteins with EFhand motifs We used three approaches to        identify EFhandcontaining proteins in         Arabidopsis First we analyzed data        from the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences        MIPS         A thaliana database MAtDB           second we carried out BLAST searches using different        known EFhand sequences nucleotide and amino acid against        the         Arabidopsis genome database and        third we searched the literature We identified         EFhand or putative EFhand proteins This estimate        represents a maximum number of possible EFhandcontaining        proteins in the         Arabidopsis genome as our analysis        was very inclusive Of these  proteins only  have        been reported in the literature Of the   were        identified by only one prediction program as having an        EFhand and the rest were identified by two or more        programs Further study is needed to verify Ca binding        activity of many of these proteins Each protein sequence        was analyzed for domains other than EFhands Several have        a variety of domains which may be useful in determining        protein function                    Results and discussion                  Identification of EFhandcontaining          proteins          To identify EFhandcontaining proteins in           Arabidopsis the protein sequences          listed as having EFhands in the InterPro Domain Table at          MAtDB   were retrieved Each protein sequence was          then analyzed for the presence of an EFhand motif and          other domains using InterProScan   There are many          databases for analyzing proteins using different          approaches to search for patterns profiles and hidden          Markov models   InterProScan was chosen because it          integrates SWISSPROT PROSITE PRINTS Pfam ProDom          SMART and TIGRFAMs programs into a single comprehensive          format Therefore scanning one site is the equivalent of          scanning seven databases that use different approaches            The InterPro Domain Table at MAtDB listed           proteins as having EFhands Eighteen sequences did not          have EFhands identifiable by InterProScan and so were          eliminated from our analysis We also did          sequencesimilarity searches using three different          EFhand proteins that have been characterized in           Arabidopsis The nucleotide and          protein sequences of           Arabidopsis CAM a protein          containing four EFhands were used to do BLAST searches          TbIastN BlastP against the           Arabidopsis genome at MAtDB            We also used the protein sequences of a Ca dependent          protein kinase CPK and a small protein with one          EFhand domain Atg Proteins showing similarity          to these proteins were checked for the presence of          EFhands using InterProScan as above Additional EFhand          proteins were found that had not been included in the          MAtDB InterPro domain table We also searched the          literature for reports of EFhandcontaining proteins in           Arabidopsis that had been          identified by various experimental approaches Additional          EFhand proteins were identified from this search          Together these searches resulted in identification of a          possible total of  EFhandcontaining proteins Tables             Seventythree of the EFhands were identified          by only one of the seven prediction programs included in          InterProScan These proteins which are indicated in bold          in Table  could be false positives Further studies are          needed to verify the Ca binding ability of these          putative EFhands It is however worth noting that the          activity of two of the proteins in this category AtPLC          and KCO has been shown to be dependent on Ca             All proteins are listed by their protein ID number          except CAM which has not been assigned an ID number          CPKs and closely related CRKs CPKrelated protein          kinases are listed in Table  as this is a large family          of proteins that has been relatively well studied in           Arabidopsis           The InterPro domain table also lists the          EFhandcontaining proteins for           Saccharomyces cerevisiae            Caenorhabditis elegans  and           Drosophila melanogaster  The          number of EFhand proteins in the human genome was given          as  with a note that the number may be an          underestimate as a result of the stringent Evalue cutoff          used for the analysis   Figure ashows a comparison          of the number of EFhandcontaining proteins in sequenced          eukaryotic organisms and the percentage of the total          number of genes represented by genes encoding EFhand          proteins Our analysis revealed that there is possibly a          very large number of EFhand proteins in           Arabidopsis           We used TargetP   to identify cellular targeting          signals in all the EFhand proteins The results from          this analysis show that EFhand proteins are present in          all major subcellular compartments Tables                             Ca binding proteins with no recognized          EFhand          Table lists proteins that were reported in the          literature as proteins containing EFhandlike domains          but where the InterProScan of these proteins did not          identify any However the proteins were shown to bind Ca           We included proteins with sequence similarity to these          proteins in Table  We did not include these proteins in          the total number of EFhand proteins nor in the          phylogenetic analysis          Caleosins are proteins with similarity to a rice          protein that was shown to bind Ca   A localization          study in rapeseed using an antibody to AtClo showed          the presence of this protein in the ER and lipid bodies            Clo was shown to be induced by abscisic acid and to          bind Ca            The InterPro documentation IPR for           proteins describes them as a large family of proteins          that are primarily homo or heterodimeric within all          eukaryotic cells They appear to effect intracellular          signaling by regulating the catalytic activity of the          bound protein by regulating interactions between the          bound protein and other proteins or by controlling the          localization of the bound protein The  protein          GF was shown to bind Ca and the binding was          localized to loop  of GF    Seven other          proteins showing strong similarity to GF have the          exact sequence in the loop considered to be the EFhand          and so were included in Table  Several other proteins          showing similarity were divergent in this loop and so          were not included          SUB was identified as a protein involved in the          cryptochrome and phytochrome signaling pathways            Guo           et al   identified two          EFhandlike domains and demonstrated binding of Ca by          SUB SUL and  are proteins showing similarity to SUB          but their sequences diverge somewhat in the EFhand          domains                          Number of EF hands          The number of EFhands in each protein varied from one          to six Figure bshows the number and percentage of          proteins having a specific number of EFhands As stated          above most EFhand proteins have pairs of EFhands          which facilitate binding of Ca   There are a large          number of proteins with an odd number of EFhand motifs            or  Several possibilities are suggested by this          observation The proteins with an odd number of EFhand          domains may function as homo or heterodimers they may          bind Ca in a weaker manner there may be another          cryptic Ca binding motif that is not identifiable          but is functional or they may not bind Ca at all Many          of the proteins containing a single EFhand motif were          identified by only one prediction program and could be          false positives          Examples of these possibilities can be seen in EFhand          proteins that have been isolated and characterized          previously The K channel protein KCO has one          identifiable EFhand but another region within the          protein also shows similarity to an EFhand Although Ca          binding of KCO was not tested the activity of the          channel was shown to be Ca dependent   AtPLC          one of a small family of phosphatidylinositolspecific          phospholipase Cs PLCs has a putative EFhand but Ca          binding was not evaluated   No other AtPLC has an          EFhand domain but the aminoterminal sequences of          several other family members have two sets of a helices          that may correspond to EFhand domains   The          putative EFhand loop of AtPLC lies between two of the a          helices The actinbinding activity of most fimbrins is          inhibited by Ca   AtFIM was shown to be Ca          independent suggesting this singleEFhand protein          does not bind Ca    The respiratory burst          oxidase family see Table  has nine members in           Arabidopsis that have either one or          two EFhands    An alignment data not shown of          these proteins however shows the presence of EFhand          like sequences for the missing EFhand domain in the          oneEFhand proteins Keller           et al   identified two EFhand          domains in RbohA which both bind Ca            in vitro RbohF in this report and          Torres           et al   although only one is          recognized by InterProScan The ability to bind Ca was          not addressed for singleEFhand proteins ABI or GDH             The CBLSOS family of proteins see Table           shows the presence of three EFhand domains             Kudla           et al   however identified a          sequence that represents a variation of the EFhand          domain that may be a fourth EFhand AtCP a protein with          three EFhand domains also has a fourth EFhandlike          sequence at the end of the protein but it is truncated          and may not be functional            The reported proteins with two EFhand domains include          two pollenassociated proteins and the Rboh proteins see          Table  Three of the proteins with two possible          EFhands were identified by only one prediction program          The CAM family and proteins closely related to CAM           CaBP PM TCH and centrin Table   and most of          the CPKs Table  have four EFhand domains The two          proteins with six EFhands are TCH and an unknown          protein Atg which are only  similar and thus          are not likely to represent duplicate genes Although the          significance of the number of EFhand domains in various          proteins is not known they may differ in their affinity          for Ca and thereby function to fine tune Ca          mediated cellular activities                          Identification of other domains in          EFhandcontaining proteins          Table lists the other domains found in the          EFhandcontaining proteins their InterProScan accession          numbers and general type of protein or domain As shown          in Table  some of the proteins predicted to have other          domains have putative EFhand motifs identified by only          one prediction program shown in bold in Table           Schematic diagrams of representative EFhand proteins are          shown in Figure  As can be seen the calmodulinlike          proteins have the EFhands distributed throughout the          protein and no other domain is present Other proteins          have the EFhands at one end or the other or in the          middle of the protein with enzymatic or regulatory          domains preceding or following the EFhands          Some of the domains listed in Table either contain an          EFhand within the domain or are a specific type of          EFhand These include EPS repeats calflagin          recoverin and SIcaBP EPS repeats are          proteinprotein interaction modules of about  residues          that were first identified in tyrosine kinase substrates          EPS and R The first of three subdomains in EPS          may include a Ca binding domain of the EFhand type          Calflagins are flagellar Ca binding proteins found in           Trypanosoma cruzi and           T brucei that have motifs similar          to EFhands Recoverin is a retinal Ca binding protein          that belongs in the EFhand family of proteins          Some of the EFhand proteins contain an           Arabidopsis retrotransposon          ATHILA ORF protein domain and one has an EnSpmlike          transposon protein domain As shown in Table  domains          found in various enzymes are present in many of the          EFhand proteins Because of the presence of EFhand          motifs in these proteins regulation of these putative          enzymes is likely to be Ca dependent The diversity of          enzymes that contain EFhands indicates that a wide          range of cellular processes is likely to be regulated by          Ca  It is also of interest that some proteins in a          family have EFhands and others do not suggesting          differential regulation of protein family members          Several identified domains indicate that some EFhand          proteins interact with other proteins or themselves or          with nucleic acids Table lists domains that are          involved in interaction with protein or DNA Cell          processes that EFhand proteins may be involved in are          suggested by domains found in transcription or          translation proteins including elongation factors and the          bHLH domain found in transcription factors Domains such          as potassium channels pollen allergen Bra r II          mitochondrial carrier proteins the cation Ca and Na           pore region and nucleoside transporters suggest          possible functions One EFhand protein has a domain          found in NPH protein a photoreceptorinteracting          protein that is essential for phototropism Another          EFhand protein has a jacalin domain found in lectins          These domains in EFhand proteins should help in          evaluating the function of these proteins For instance          the EFhand protein identified as having a pollen          allergen Bra r II domain is similar to an EFhand protein          from pollen APC isolated by Rozwadowski           et al   They showed APCs          affinity for Ca and the potential for a Ca dependent          conformational change          Motifs such as the ATPGTPbinding region suggest that          the proteins containing them interact with or bind to          certain molecules PTM is the site for attachment of          phosphopantetheine the prosthetic group of acyl carrier          proteins in some multienzyme complexes PTSHPRSER is a          serine phosphorylation site found in HPr a protein in          the phosphoenolpyruvatedependent sugar          phosphotransferase system in bacteria and UIM ubiquitin          interaction motif is a receptor for polyubiquitination          of polypeptide chains                          Phylogenetic analysis of EFhandcontaining          proteins                      Group I proteins            None of the proteins in group I Figure  has been            reported in the literature Some of them contain            domains that give clues to their function including            elongation factors DNA protein or ATPGTPbinding            proteins and others Tables and                                 Group II proteins            Group II includes KCO AtPLC and the two fimbrins            Figure  that have been reported in the literature            Table  Two other proteins show similarity to KCO            and may also be Ca regulated K channels A family            of phosphatidylinositolspecific phospholipase Cs have            been isolated but only one of them AtPLC has an            EFhand domain Figure  and see also               AtPLC a protein isolated as a dehydration and salt            stressinduced gene was able to hydrolyze            phosphatidylinositolbisphosphate and the activity            was completely dependent on Ca   AtFIM was            identified as an EFhandcontaining protein Figure             however Kovar             et al   found that AtFIM            was Ca independent and so this may be a            nonfunctional EFhand as pointed out by McCurdy and            Kim   Four other proteins in the MatDB are similar            to AtFIM but only one has an EFhand motif            Two small subgroups nucleoside transporters and            mitochondrial carrier proteins also fell into group II            Figures   As far as we know Ca binding            studies have not been done for these proteins                                Group III proteins            CBLSOSS fall into group III Figure  The first            CBLSOS was isolated as a protein involved in salt            stress SOS and as a calcineurin Blike protein            CBL    Ten CBLSOSS have been identified              Expression of CBL is induced by drought cold and            wounding stress In animals calcineurin is a            heterodimer composed of a regulatory B subunit and a            protein phosphatase catalytic A subunit CBLSOSS show            similarity to the B subunit Figure  SOS was            however shown to interact with a protein kinase              and a family of interacting protein kinases has been            identified     Both Albrecht             et al   and Kim             et al   have identified the            domain in the kinases required for the interactions of            protein kinase with CBLSOS            AtCP which contains three EFhands Figure  is            another NaClstressinduced protein that has been shown            to bind Ca   A bean homolog of AtCP has been            shown to be associated with the hypersensitive response              A subgroup of proteins identified in this search            show similarity to the protein phosphatase A            regulatory B subunit One of these Atg            AF was reported in the literature   They            have one EFhand domain but contain no other            identifiable domains Figure  One other protein of            interest in this group KIC KCBPinteracting            CCDlike protein was identified as a protein that            interacts with KCBP kinesinlike calmodulinbinding            protein a protein known to interact with and be            regulated by Ca calmodulin    KIC has only            one EFhand Figure  and is similar to a wheat Ca            binding protein CCD                                  Group IV proteins            Group IV contains the calmodulins CAMs and closely            related proteins such as CaBP centrin and the TCH            gene proteins Figures  CAMs are highly conserved            smallmolecularweight acidic proteins of  amino            acids listed as  the starting Met is cleaved            following translation The four EFhands two pairs            connected by a central helix bind four molecules of Ca               Binding of Ca to CAM results in a            conformational change which then allows CAM to interact            with target proteins to modulate their activity or            function                Nine             Arabidopsis CAMs have been            reported in the literature       Seven            of these are highly conserved having  amino acids            CAMs  with only  aminoacid differences between            them CAM has not been given a protein identification            number BLAST searches with CAM pick CAM as the            closest sequence However at the nucleotide level they            are only  identical There are two ESTs that are             and  identical to             CAM but only  and             identical respectively to             CAM CAM and CAM are divergent            CAMs They have  rather than  amino acids and            vary considerably in the fourth EFhand domain            Although they complemented a yeast calmodulin              CMD  mutant they did lot form            a complex with a basic amphiphilic helical peptide in            the presence of Ca  unlike conventional CAMs that do              As can be seen in Figure  they do not fall            into the same group as the other CAMs with CAM being            more divergent than CAM No other EFhand proteins            have  amino acids although others do have a few            more or less Table  Expression studies of the             Arabidopsis CAM genes show that            they are differentially expressed in different tissues            and circumstances For             CAM CAM and             CAM CAM was the only one            expressed in roots and             CAM could not be detected in            floral stocks             CAM CAM and             CAM are inducible by touch            stimulation but at different levels and with different            kinetics               CAM CAM and             CAM were all expressed in            leaves but only             CAM and             CAM were detected in siliques              Different             Arabidopsis CAM isoforms also            differ in their affinity for the same protein                          Two proteins induced by touch rain wind wounding            and darkness TCH and TCH are also in group IV and            are related to the CAMs TCH has  amino acids with            four EFhands and TCH has  amino acids with six            EFhands Another CAMlike protein CaBP is closely            related to the conventional CAMs Figure  It has             amino acids  ammoacid sequence identity with CAM             in the EFhand domains and has been shown to bind            Ca   Centrins are a little more distantly            related to CAMs Figure  An             Arabidopsis centrin gene              apa  was isolated as a gene            rapidly induced after pathogen inoculation   One            other EFhand protein is  similar to centrin            suggesting there are two centrin genes in             Arabidopsis             Two proteins reported in the literature fall into a            subgroup of CAMlike proteins A novel EFhand protein            PM Figure  was isolated from a cDNA library that            overrepresents plasmamembraneassociated proteins              The other protein APC is a pollen Ca binding            protein that is a member of the pollen allergen family              Another protein Atg is  similar to            APC They are the smallest of the EFhand proteins            having only  amino acids Figure                                 Group V proteins            The  CPKs and three CPKrelated protein kinases            CRKs make up almost all of group V Figure  The            other three proteins in the group do not have any other            identifiable domains CPKs are serinethreonine protein            kinases with a CAMlike domain CLD usually containing            four EFhands with two exceptions Table  Figure             These kinases have been called CDPKs however we            use the most recent designation namely CPKs                Three of the eight CRKs in             Arabidopsis have one EFhand            domain However sequence alignment of the EFhand            regions of CPKs and CRKs revealed that CRKs contain            degenerate EFhand motifs Figure  CPKs are present            only in plants and some protozoans The PlantsP            database   reports that most of the CPKs and CRKs            contain transmembrane and Nmyristoylation domains            TargetP predicts that some CPKs and CRKs are targeted            to the chloroplast or mitochondria   The cellular            localization for most of these protein kinases needs to            be confirmed experimentally            CPKs range from  to  amino acids Table             with four distinct domains a variable region at the            amino terminus approximately  amino acids a            serinethreonine protein kinase domain approximately             amino acids an autoinhibitory domain also called            the junction region approximately  amino acids and            the regulatory CLD approximately  amino acids            Figure  The autoinhibitory domain is involved in            inhibiting the enzyme activity in the absence of Ca            whereas the variable region at the amino terminus may            account for their substrate specificity andor            localization   CRKs have similar domain            organization as compared to CPKs Figure  Most of            the CPKs contain fattyacylation sites including those            for myristoylation and palmitoylation which seem to be            necessary for targeting to membranes and for            proteinprotein interactions   The protein kinase            domain in CRKs shows strong sequence similarity to the            kinase domain in CPKs but the autoinhibitory and CLDs            in CRKs show weak sequence similarity to the            corresponding domains in CPKs            CPKs have basal activities in the absence of Ca as            a result of the presence of the autoinhibitory region            Ca binds the EFhands of the CLD which results in            intramolecular rearrangement and relief of            autoinhibition    Eight CPK isoforms have been            shown to be activated by Ca      The            presence of multiple isoforms of CPKs in the             Arabidopsis genome implies that            they may be involved in specific Ca signaling            networks may respond differentially to changes in            oscillation frequency magnitude and duration of Ca            signal or may have temporal and spatial patterns of            expression and localization Little is known about the            function and substrates for CPKs in             Arabidopsis CPK is known to            interact with  proteins   and is involved in            the inactivation of a Ca pump   Expression of            CPK and  is inducible by cold and drought                An             Arabidopsis CPK phosphorylates            tonoplast intrinsic protein TIP a putative            waterchannel protein   Substrates of CPKs in            other plants have been identified and can be used to            deduce the function of homologs in             Arabidopsis The PlantsP website            database   is a valuable source of information on            CPKs            Besides the inclusion of the fulllength sequences            of CPKs and CRKs in the overall phylogenetic analysis            a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the protein            sequence of the CLD region of CPKs and CRKs Figure             Similar trees were obtained using either            fulllength CPKsCRKs Figure  or the CLD region of            the CPKSCRKs Figure  As shown in Figure  the            CPKs form five distinct subgroups IV The CRKs are            most closely related to subgroup IV The tree made            using fulllength sequences Figure  has four            subgroups members of subgroups III and V in Figure            fall into one subgroup in Figure                                 Group VI            Figure shows the remaining proteins that do not            fall into one of the other five groups It includes the            respiratory burst oxidase homology proteins Rbohs            ABI GDH and TPC Plant defense responses include            production of reactive oxygen species oxidative burst              Torres             et al and Keller             et al    isolated             Arabidopsis homologs Rbohs to            the             gp             phox subunit of the neutrophil            NADPH oxidase which generates a similar oxidative            burst in neutrophils Six Rbohs AF have been            isolated experimentally and three others have been            identified in the             Arabidopsis genome Figures and             RbohF called RbohA in Keller             et al   like animal Rboh            enzymes is an intrinsic plasma membrane protein but            unlike animal Rboh it has EFhands that were shown to            bind Ca   Both Leung             et al and Meyer             et al isolated the             ABI gene                ABI is similar to            serinethreonine phosphatase C which in animals is Mg            or Mn but not Ca dependent Figure              ABI is induced by abscisic acid            and was shown to regulate stomatal aperture in leaves            and mitotic activity in root meristems    A            second             ABI gene              ABI  was isolated using             ABI as a probe   The            protein encoded by the cDNA had an eightresidue            insertion in the EFhand domain that does not conform            to the EFhand signature A similar situation holds for            glutamate dehydrogenases Two genes were isolated one            coded for a dehydrogenase with an EFhand GDH            Figure  and the other one without GDH              Studies by Furuichi             et al   indicate that TPC            is a twopore channel that mediates Ca influx It has            two EFhandlike motifs located in a hydrophilic domain            that connects the two transmembrane regions containing            the pores   Ca binding was not shown            experimentally for ABI GDH or TPC            Three proteins in this group have a domain present            in a small GTPase protein Figure and Gtp in Figure             Another threemember group Pyr in Figure  of            proteins has a domain for FADdependent pyridine            nucleotidedisulfide oxidoreductase FADpyrredox            Figures and                                       Conclusions        A plants adaptively variable behavior or plasticity        during its lifetime has been described as plant        intelligence   and Ca and its sensors are key        players in this adaptive behavior The large number of        potential EFhandcontaining proteins indicates how Ca                 cyt changes can profoundly affect a wide        array of cellular processes Plants seem to have a large        number of EFhandcontaining proteins some of which have        homologs in nonplant systems whereas others are unique to        plants In addition plants also have unique sets of        proteins that interact with Ca sensors   Signals        from stresses such as pathogens drought cold and salt are        mediated by EFhand proteins       Hormones        induce EFhand proteins    as do pathogen attacks           Some EFhand proteins such as small GTPases and        potassium channels are involved in signaling   Others        appear to be involved in developmental pathways For        example the S domain proteins are involved in cell        growth and differentiation cellcycle regulation and        metabolic control   The wide variety of domains in        EFhand proteins also shows the diversity of the processes        in which Ca is involved However many of the EFhand        proteins give little clue as to their function and may lead        us in many other directions as their functions are        elucidated        The complexity of the Ca messenger system is increased        through the existence of families of proteins At the first        level calmodulin adds complexity first in the number of        isoforms present in         Arabidopsis The regulation of        expression and the kinetics of interaction of these        isoforms with different proteins can lend complexity to        cell signaling A second level of complexity is the number        of proteins identified that interact with calmodulin At        least  calmodulinbinding proteins CBPs have been        identified in         Arabidopsis   Differential        expression of these proteins in cell types developmental        periods and in response to signals adds more complexity to        the pathways that can be regulated by CAM        The CPKs a very large family of protein kinases also        add complexity to Ca regulation Although the mechanism        of regulation may be similar in each CPK         Arabidopsis CPKs may differ in their        affinity for Ca in general and in the presence of their        specific substrate in particular CPKs affinity for Ca        is many times higher in the presence of substrate than in        its absence   The involvement of only specific CPKs in        stress responses has already been shown          Identification of the substrates for each CPK and their        temporal and spatial expression will be needed for        elucidating the pathways of Ca control in plants        Other families such as the phosphatases Rbohs and        CBLSOSS also contribute to the complexity of Ca        involvement in the regulation of many processes        Characterization of more Ca binding proteins will lead        to further understanding of the roles of Ca and        crosstalk among various components of Ca signaling and        other messengers in plants                    Materials and methods                  Identification of EFhandcontaining          proteins          Proteins containing EF hands were first identified          using the InterPro Domain Table at MIPS           A thaliana database MAtDB            The protein sequences of the  proteins listed at MAtDB          were obtained and analyzed for EFhands and other domains          using InterProScan   Proteins not showing EFhand          domains were eliminated from the list To identify          proteins not listed in the InterPro Domain Table at          MAtDB BLAST searches were done with three different          EFhandcontaining proteins calmodulin KIC and a Ca          dependent protein kinase CPK BlastP searches were          done for KIC and CDPK and BlastP and TbIastN for          calmodulin   Sequences for proteins showing sequence          similarity to these proteins were also checked by          InterProScan and any protein containing an EFhand domain          but not found on the InterPro Domain Table was added to          the list A literature search for           Arabidopsis proteins containing          EFhands was also done using PubMed at NCBI National          Center for Biotechnology Information                            Identification of domains and organellar targeting          signals          Information about domains other than the EFhand          domain was collected from the InterProScan searches done          for each protein sequence Targeting information for each          protein was obtained from the MAtDB general report that          includes the results of TargetP                            Phylogenetic analysis          The fulllength sequences of all proteins identified          by InterProScan as containing an EFhand including those          that are identified by only one prediction program were          aligned using MEGALIGN A heuristic method using PAUP          a generated  trees A majorityrules consensus          tree was computed from the  trees For the CPKs and          CRKs a second alignment was done using the CAMlike          domains A bootstrap method of PAUPa with           bootstraps was used to generate the tree
