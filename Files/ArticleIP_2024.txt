                                 Vote for Women            President Clinton weretold is reckless He was reckless with Gennifer Flowers in a bathroom duringa party with Kathleen Willey just off the Oval Office and with MonicaLewinsky ditto ditto ditto Heedless of the consequences Clinton again andagain has followed as Joseph Campbell used to say his bliss            All thismay be true But if it is how do we reconcile it with Clintons behavior inthe political realm There he has carried risk aversion to rarely reachedheights He will pay almost any price in terms of policy to marginally reducethe chances of losing an election            To pick up some superfluous SlavicAmerican votes Clintondecided to expand NATO something virtually no policy analyst anywhere near himon the ideological spectrum considered a good idea To pick up some superfluousCubanAmerican votes he signed the HelmsBurton law which predictably enragedAmericas key allies and trading partners Meanwhile over in domestic policyClintons lodestar has been the focus group            How can itbe that these two identitiesbold reckless pursuer of bliss and timiddesperate pursuer of officeexist in the same man            There are to resolve this paradox One is toremember that the pursuit of office can lead to bliss Maybe Clintons fondnessfor the Gennifers and Monicas who are the perks of a job like governor orpresident keeps him from taking policy risks that might deprive him of the jobMaybe his emulation of John F Kennedys lifestyle is what keeps him fromabiding by Profiles in Courage             Come tothink of it Kennedy himself though nominally the author of that book didntglaringly exemplify its message of principle above politics Hence a generaltheory Men who obsessively convert power into sex are less willing to riskpower for principle            We can test this theory by using as our control groupRichard Nixon For all we know Nixon had a tryst or twobut he cant hold acandle to the legends of Kennedy or Clinton Try picturing him cavorting in theWhite House pool with nude staff nymphs or confidently steering a beautifulwomans hand southward            So does our theory hold DidNixons presumed freedom from sex addiction leave him free from addiction tooffice Um no That Nixon had more than a casual attraction to power is a factto which various convicted felons on his staff can attest If we wantprincipled leaders electing more men like Nixon and fewer like Clintonwouldnt seem to be the ticket            On theother hand it might make sense to elect fewer men generally The point hereisnt just the wellknown claim that men by nature are more blindly libidinousthan women It is the Darwinian corollary of that claim Men by nature pursuepower more desperately than women do            During evolution the whole Darwinianpoint of male powerlots of sex lots of offspringdidnt compute forfemales For women lots of sex didnt mean lots of offspring Power to besure brought other benefits to a females genetic legacy so women naturallylike having power They just dont like it as much as men do            Chimpanzees our nearest relatives are political animals As the primatologistFrans de Waal has observed male chimps seem to live in a hierarchical worldwith replaceable coalition partners and a single permanent goal power Forfemales on the other hand coalitions withstand time Thus a malechimpcall him Billmight be making nice to his liberal internationalistfriends one day and signing simian bills sponsored by Jesse Helms the next Incontrast a female chimpcall her Pat Schroederwould hew truer to her coreconstituency            So the Bill Clinton paradoxhis reckless pursuit of sexand his timid clinging to officeis indeed no paradox The former doesseem to explain the latter But only in a broad specieswide sense The reasonmen to put power above principle is because during human evolution power ledto sex This evolutionbred hunger for power is built into men generallyincluding those such as Nixon for whom translating power into sex is not ahigh personal priority            Thesolution is obvious If you want elected officials who put principle ahead ofpower voting for women gives you better odds            But do keep in mind that gender differenceseven fairly firm ones are only aggregate differences The average womanwill surrender less principle for power than the average man And womenwho become heads of state are not average Prime Minister Margaret Thatchercertainly was no stereotypical female Britains war with Argentina over afew barren islands which Thatcher prosecuted with the zeal of a Churchill hasbeen compared to two bald men fighting over a comb            Still though Thatcher mayhave been more ambitious than the typical woman she was a paragon ofideological fidelity compared with Clinton or Ronald Reagan Just as femalepoliticians are more powerhungry than the average female so also are malepoliticians even more powerhungry than the average male While admittingthat Clinton is representative of my gender I must add on behalf of meneverywhere that hes an especially egregious example            Clintonsdetractors have argued that his alleged treatment of Lewinsky and Willey is abetrayal of the feminist values he professes Maybe But in another sense hisfeminist credentials look better than ever He has providedindeed he hasbecomea potent argument for bringing more women into public office                           If youmissed our links in the story click to read Wrights evolutionary take on how Clinton can be and
