                                 Dead Eurocrats            Printed money like thegovernment budgets behind it is conceived in optimism if not in fantasy Thevery designs on the billssuch as the fortresslike Treasury that appears onour  noteseem to promise a happy future of redemption amid prosperity Thebills arent called promissory notes for nothing What they promise is a flushtill            In this timehonored spiritthe new designs for the uniform currency of the European Community offerbeguiling visions of unity and wealth of responsible fiscal practice andthriving trade Revealed last December and slated to go into use across thecontinent in a few years these notes herald nothing less than a new and noblyunified Europe            But forall their color and utopian promise the new notes are lifeless After allcoinage and currency usually reflect the character of the issuing state and inthis case the state is largely bureaucratic The European Monetary Institutionin Frankfurt which under the  Maastricht Treaty is charged with making thenew Eurodollar is described in its own literature as an organization of theEuropean Union with legal personality Legal personality is right on themark This is money designed not by bureaucrats but by Eurocrats an allstarteam of international paperpushers            Everything about the new currency is vintage Eurocrat Itsname the euro was picked because it translates easily into almost everymember countrys language Only Greek with its own native alphabet requires asecond rendering of the name on the bill Its counterfeitproofconstructionwhich includes the use of unreproducible holographsattests tothe businesslike thought of its designers And the decision to cut each of theseven notes in a different size as well as a different color to help thevisually impaired reveals the practicalminded Eurocrats more considerateside            Thespecifications laid out for the look of the new bank notes by the institutionare as tortuously legalistic as the notorious specs issued in Brussels theseat of the new Eurocracy to regulate intracontinental trade The Brusselsrules fastidiously prescribe every detail of what can and cannot be sold withinthe European economic community yielding such creations as the Euroapplealready infamous in the orchards of Wye Westfalia and everywhere else thatfruit cultivated for centuries has been found not to make the grade Back inJune  the European Monetary Institution set up committees to choosepossible themes for the designs settling at last on two a historical onethe ages and styles of Europe and a geometrical one abstract modernThese themes were broad enough to encompass almost anything individualdesigners could come up with What they ruled out were portraits of peopleespecially portraits of leaders Individuals inevitably raise the specter ofnationalism No dead presidents here            The institution next held a competitioninviting design teams from the central banks of the various member nations toenter Thirtysome entries flowed in for consideration by a jury of  expertswhose diverse national and professional backgrounds rivaled even the crew ofStar Trek ranging from Baron Philippe RobertJones art historian andpermanent secretary of the Academie Royale des Sciences des Lettres et desBeauxarts de Belgique in Brussels to Guido Crapanzano rector of theInstituto di Scienze della Comunicazione in Milan Last July the jury picked awinner although it has kept the creators identities unpublicized in theinterest of future continental unity            The winning designer wentfor the ages and styles theme interpreted as such stock architecturalelements as bridges windows and gateways The eight ages in which thesebridges windows and gateways appear are Classical Romanesque GothicRenaissance Baroque and Rococo the age of iron and glass architecture andthe age of modern architecture The colors are muted and staid theillustrations as innocuous impeccable and dispassionate as those you wouldfind in an economics textbook            Theyrealso supposed to have symbolic meaning The windows and gates represent thespirit of openness and cooperation of the new confederation we are told whilethe bridge is a metaphor as Bill Clinton showed guaranteed not to go over theheads of the populace of any continent More specifically according to theliterature the bridge epitomizes the dawn of the new common Europe with itscommon cultural heritage and the vision of a common future in the next centuryindeed the new millennium These are not mind you actual existing bridgeslike London Bridge or the Pont Neuf but are generic and cannot be attributedto any particular place in any single country            The result is an entire landscape of the generica placethat is never France or Germany but always just Europe as it might figure inlandscapes chosen for American travel ads Looking at them you try to conjureup the people whose wallets these bills will inhabit the new race of Europeanswho will have no English umbrellas French berets or German bellies It is noteasy            These notes cool andconsidered may make more practical sense than our greenbacks with their wackyeye on the pyramid swiped from Masonic lore and the Model Tera automobile thatstill putts along in front of the Treasury building But will they ever reallycirculate According to the Maastricht Treaty the currency will be put intocirculation only after individual national economies have hit certaintargetssuch as a sufficiently low ratio of debt to gross domestic productBut these targets still seem far out of reach Germany which has the largesteconomy and the strongest currency in the group was supposed to lead the waybut recently German unemployment has jumped to levels not seen since the WeimarRepublic and the mark is softening            The European MonetaryInstitution promises that it will announce within the next two years the exactdate on which the euros will go into use Its supposed to be no later thanJan   Not until then will we know whether this is real money or funnymoneywhether it will be worth a continental
