        happen to know what the laws are in Texas     uh capital punishment is uh you know accepted an accepted punishment it its legal   uhhuh   uh there are uh there have been a number of executions over the last few years   hum   uh they drag you know the the appeals drag on interminably it seems sometimes um personally i kept i keep thinking that if i could be guaranteed that the people who perpetrate some of these vicious crimes were never allowed free then i would not be in favor of capital punishment but when   oh i see what youre saying   but uh when i know that uh they could be paroled and go right back to doing what they did before i i feel decidedly uneasy uneasy about it   huh   what about New York   well in New York im not quite sure but what sounds familiar to me is that  its its not legal except in cases of murder of police officers   uhhuh okay   i might be mistaken but thats what sounds familiar to me   umhum   so uh so we dont hear about it   well yeah   i was visiting in California recently and apparently they over about two weeks ago they just executed one fellow   umhum   it is legal there but they they always put it off and put it off and they finally for the first time in twenty five years executed someone   yes umhum yes   so that was quite the news   i remember reading about that um   is it only usually in cases of murder sort of an eye for an eye kind of thing   its uh its more than that i think its a capital murder uh where uh there there was an intent to do other harm as well you know where you you engaged in another felony like robbery at at the same time that you murdered someone   okay i know theres a a subtle subtle difference between manslaughter and murder   yes   i guess you can commit manslaughter by running somebody over by accident that kind of thing   by accident yes uhhuh thats my understanding of it uh but that uh murder is something that you do intentionally   uhhuh   uh   i dont know it just seems to me that everybody wants to know if they do something whats going to happen to them   umhum   i substitute teach and i have kids who talk fresh dont do homework and they say so whats going to happen to me and and people getting less and less respect and they understand they know that the bottom line is not very much is going to happen to them   umhum   so if i could be sure that the people who are sentenced to execution absolutely did it because you know during the with the jury system youre not quite sure   umhum no youre not   you know i i id feel comfortable with it if i knew absolutely certainly that this person actually murdered someone     umhum umhum or   but i i think the reason we dont go for it is because were afraid that we might be making a mistake and you cant fix it   thats right and and its a terrible thing to do uh and the world our world seems to become more and more violent all the time by the way im a public school administrator  so   okay well did you do you find that the kids are changing and they they dont they they dont respect authority anymore   oh at all they they do not respect authority uh they kill for fun   i   uh they shoot guns for amusement after parties um   hum well the guns are legal where you are its quite a to do to get a gun around here legally that is   yes well it its not its not legal to carry a handgun in Texas but no its not you can have it in your home   oh i didnt know that okay   or in your car if youre traveling from one city to another   oh okay that clears that   but uh rifles shotguns those sorts of guns are legal   umhum well they can do just as much damage   oh yes its just that theyre harder to hide     thats true   but i do  i feel decidedly uneasy about the judicial system in our country now not only because we cant be sure that the jury you know has made the right decision that the person who did its really guilty or really isnt guilty and yet i feel very uncomfortable about the numbers of people who are paroled put back on the streets and within a few months are raping and killing other people
