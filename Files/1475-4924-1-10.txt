                    Background        The         hedgehog          hh  gene was identified two decades        ago in         Drosophila as a critical regulator of        cellfate determination during embryogenesis            Subsequent work in several model systems has defined and        characterized the         Hh gene family that encodes highly        conserved secreted signaling proteins for review see            Hedgehog Hh proteins are synthesized as approximately         kDa precursors that autoprocess in an unprecedented        fashion resulting in the covalent attachment of a        cholesterol moiety to the aminoterminal half of the        precursor     This processed aminoterminal domain        HhNp is responsible for the activation of a unique and        complex signaling cascade that is essential for controlling        cell fate throughout development and into adulthood            In mammals there are three Hhfamily proteins Sonic Shh        Indian Ihh and Desert Dhh Genetargeting experiments        in mice have demonstrated that the development and        patterning of essentially every major organ requires input        from the Hh pathway                    In vitro culture systems of neuronal        tissues have been used to characterize the biology of the        Hhsignaling pathway Most notably the neuralplate        explant assay has defined the concentrationdependent role        that ventrally expressed Shh plays in opposing dorsally        expressed bone morphogenetic proteins BMPs to pattern the        neural tube     The assay demonstrates that the        Hhsignaling cascade can distinguish between small        concentration differences in the Hh ligand to instruct the        differentiation of specific neuronal cell types Additional        insights have been gained by utilizing cultures of        postnatal cerebellar neuron precursors     These        studies have shown that Hh patterns the cerebellum by        promoting proliferation of the granule neuron precursors        Given the role that Hh signaling plays in promoting        progenitorcell proliferation it is not surprising that        misregulation of Hh signaling has been implicated in the        biology of certain cancers in particular basal cell        carcinoma BCC and medulloblastoma        The Hhsignaling pathway comprises three main        components the Hh ligand a transmembrane receptor circuit        composed of the negative regulator Patched Ptc plus an        activator Smoothened Smo and finally a cytoplasmic        complex that regulates the Cubitus interruptus Ci or Gli        family of transcriptional effectors Additional pathway        components are thought to modulate the activity or        subcellular distribution of these molecules     There        is positive and negative feedback at the transcriptional        level as the         Gli and         Ptc genes are direct transcriptional        targets of activation of the pathway        Smo is a sevenpass transmembrane protein with homology        to Gproteincoupled receptors GPCRs while Ptc is a        twelvepass transmembrane protein that resembles a channel        or transporter Consistent with its role as an essential        pathway inhibitor removal of Ptc renders the Hh pathway        constitutively on independent of the Hh ligand        Similarly specific point mutations in the transmembrane        helices of Smo are capable of constitutively stimulating        the pathway effectively bypassing Ptc inhibition            At present a controversy surrounds the mechanism by which        Ptc inhibits Smo Although early studies suggested a        simple direct stoichiometric regulation more recent data        support a more complicated indirect or catalytic model            And although it has been demonstrated that Hh directly        interacts with    and destabilizes    Ptc the        downstream molecular events remain obscure In particular        little is known about the means by which Ptc exerts its        inhibitory effect on Smo or how Smo communicates with the        cytoplasmic CiGli transcription factor complex        Through a chemical genetic approach of identifying and        studying the mechanism of action of smallmolecule agonists        and antagonists we hoped to uncover some of the        complexities of the Hhsignaling system Smallmolecule        modulators of growthfactor pathways have proven valuable        in providing enhanced understanding of the intracellular        events that occur subsequent to receptor activation and in        establishing the biological functions of these pathways              In Hh signaling multiple insights have been gained        through the use of the plantderived Hh antagonist        cyclopamine           and a recently        identified synthetic smallmolecule Hhsignaling inhibitor        Cur     Interestingly these specific inhibitors        of Hh signaling appear to function downstream of Ptc but        their precise molecular targets and mechanism of action        are unknown        Although genetic manipulations involving        gainoffunction point mutations of Smo    have        demonstrated that the pathway can be activated        independently of Hh ligand no small molecules with this        capability have been identified Indeed it has proven        difficult to identify smallmolecule agonists of any        signaling pathway activated by a protein ligand Two        examples have recently been described however One        involved identification of a nonpeptide activator of the        granulocyte colonystimulating factor GCSF pathway that        appeared to act via receptor oligomerization            Another report described a smallmolecule activator of the        insulinsignaling pathway that also acts at the level of        the receptor            Since the Hh receptor Ptc serves to inhibit signaling        a smallmolecule pathway activator would need to be capable        of one of the following first interfering with the        inhibitory effect that Ptc exerts on Smo second        activating Smo without affecting Ptc or third activating        the pathway downstream of Smo Identifying small molecules        with any of these activities would provide useful        information concerning the details of Hh signaling and        would also provide a simple means of modulating activity of        the pathway         in vivo or         in vitro         In this article we show that a nonpeptidyl        smallmolecule agonist of Hh signaling has been identified        that has all the known signaling properties of the        recombinant Hh protein But this agonist unlike Hh        protein appears to bypass the Ptcregulatory step by        interacting directly with Smo Furthermore studies with        the agonist and several antagonists of Hh signaling suggest        that Smo can be activated or inhibited by direct        interaction with smallmolecule ligands These observations        suggest that the PtcSmo receptor circuit may incorporate        native smallmolecule ligands in the regulation of Hh        signaling                    Results                  Isolation of Hh agonists by highthroughput          screening          To identify smallmolecule agonists of Hh signaling          we established a mammaliancellbased assay After          testing several cell lines for Hhdependent induction of          the target genes           Ptc and           Gli     we identified          CHT and TM cells as optimal responders We then          introduced into each line a plasmid containing a          luciferase reporter downstream of multimerized Gli          binding sites and a minimal promoter     An isolated          stable clone of the T cell transfectants referred          to as clone S gave a fold upregulation of          luciferase activity Figure a when stimulated with Hh          protein    for  hours Using this assay system we          screened  synthetic compounds at a concentrations          of  M and isolated several putative agonists One of          these molecules  HhAg  Figure ab  was studied          further HhAg  exhibited halfmaximal stimulation EC                      at around  M and an activation          maximum A           max  of approximately  compared to          the Hh protein control Figure a In the presence of          subthreshold signaling levels of Hh protein  nM          the EC            of HhAg  was reduced to around           M and the A           max approached  Figure a          We next tested whether expression of endogenous          Hhresponsive genes was stimulated by the agonist Using          quantitative PCR HhAg  was shown clearly to elevate          the expression of           Gli and           Ptc in a dosedependent manner          Figure c                          Chemical modifications increase potency          In an effort to improve the potency of HhAg  over           derivatives were synthesized and tested in the          cellbased reporter assay The relative potencies of the          most active derivatives     and   are          shown in Figure d The most potent HhAg  had an EC                     of approximately  nM Thus          potency was increased over fold by chemical          modification The structures of compounds  and  are          shown in Figure e HhAg  was the most stable          derivative           in vivo and           in vitro data not shown and was          used for most cellbased assays HhAg  showed lower          toxicity in embryonic tissue cultures data not shown          and was used for the neural plate explant assays          described below These experiments suggest that the          agonist may have many of the properties of the Hh ligand          To specifically test this we used two established           in vitro assay systems that detect          the effects of Hh on primary neuronal precursors                          In vitroassay of neuronal precursors                      Proliferation activity of the agonist            It has recently been shown that primary neonatal            cerebellar granule neuron CGN precursors proliferate            in response to Hh stimulation     To determine            whether the Hh agonist could elicit this response we            monitored  Hthymidine incorporation of cultured rat            CGN precursors treated with Hh protein HhAg             HhAg  or vehicle DMSO The original active            molecule HhAg  stimulated thymidine incorporation            at  M but not at  M Figure f The extent of            proliferation was around  of that seen with a high            dose of Hh protein  nM HhAg  stimulated            proliferation at  nM and  nM to levels comparable            to those seen with Hh protein Figure f These data            demonstrate that the agonists can elicit a biological            response in primary cells similar to that produced by            Hh protein                                Morphogenic activity of the agonist            Neural progenitors within the intermediate region of            the chick neural plate Figure a respond to            increasing concentrations of Hh protein by adopting            specific fates The identity of these cells can be            assessed by their distinct expression patterns of a set            of transcription factors     Three of these            transcription factors  Pax MNR and Nkx  whose            expression is differentially sensitive to increasing            concentrations of Hh protein were assayed in response            to varying concentrations of the agonist HhAg             The dorsal spinal cord marker Pax is normally            repressed by low concentrations of Hh     Pax            expression was extinguished by  nM agonist Figure            bcdef Higher concentrations of agonist             nM induced expression of the motor neuron progenitor            marker MNR Figure bghij and yet higher            concentrations  nM M induced the most ventral            interneuron progenitor marker Nkx Figure            bklmn This dosedependent profile of expression            closely resembles the response achieved by increasing            concentrations of Hh protein                  demonstrating that the Hh agonist mimics the            concentrationdependent inductive activity of Hh on            neural precursors                                    Activity of the agonist in vivo                      Agonist site of action in vivo            Having established an             in utero assay for Hh signaling            we next investigated whether the agonist could rescue            aspects of             Shh  or             Smo mutant phenotypes by            monitoring             lacZ expression in             Smo              Ptc             lacZ embryos    and             Ptc mRNA levels in             Shh embryos            Pregnant mice from             Shh and             Smo intercrosses were treated            by oral gavage with vehicle or agonist  mgkg at             and  dpc Embryos were collected at  somite            stages E when the midline defects are first            detectable in both             Shh and             Smo embryos but prior to any            general retardation of growth and development                 In both             Shh and             Smo              Ptc             lacZ embryos             Ptc was detected in ventral            neural tube somites and lateral plate mesoderm Figure            eim Treatment with the agonist dramatically            enhanced and expanded the expression of             Ptc in these heterozygous            embryos Figure fjn This was consistent with what            we have observed in wildtype embryos Figure            abcd It is worth noting that the agonisttreated            embryos exhibited overgrowth of the headfolds and            hindbrain reminiscent of             Ptc embryos compare Figure            emwith fn                        Shh and             Smo embryos at this stage             somites started to show fused ventral lips of the            cephalic folds and a single continuous optic vesicle            indicating lack of a clearly defined midline red            arrow Figure g and data not shown As expected             Ptc expression was not detected            in the ventral neural tube of the vehicletreated             Shh embryos arrowhead Figure            g whereas expression was seen in lateral plate            mesoderm and weakly in somites Figure gk This is            most likely due to Ihh signaling in these tissues                Both Shh and Ihh signaling were dependent on Smo            however because             Ptc expression could not be            detected in             Smo embryos Figure o            Following agonist treatment we observed that the            neural tube and somite expression of             Ptc in             Shh embryos was greater than            vehicletreated wildtype levels compare Figure            hlwith ei The midline defects in             Shh embryos were at least            partly rescued by agonist treatment compare Figure            gand h red arrows Like             Shh embryos             Shh embryos had overgrown            headfolds after administration of the Hh agonist            Figure fand h In contrast agonist treatment had no            detectable effect on either morphology or             Ptc expression in             Smo embryos compare Figure            oand p In summary these studies demonstrate that            agonist activity             in vivo does not depend upon Shh            but that Smo is absolutely required                                    Mechanism of action                      Chemical epistasis studies            We sought to determine the level at which the            agonist acts in the Hh pathway in cultured cell            assays To begin addressing this question we used the            Hh reporter cell line to conduct competition            experiments between the Hh agonist and known Hh            signaling antagonists that block the pathway at            different levels Figure a These include a            Hhproteinblocking antibody E     a natural            product derivative cyclopamine     that has            recently been shown to act downstream of Ptc perhaps            at the level of Smo     a recently identified            synthetic smallmolecule inhibitor Cur which has            inhibitory properties similar to cyclopamine                and forskolin an adenylate cyclaseprotein kinase A            activator that is thought to block Hh signaling by            stimulating degradation of members of the Gli family of            transcriptional activators                The Hhblocking antibody E had no effect on            pathway activation by the agonist Figure b while            forskolin Figure c cyclopamine Figure d and            Cur Figure e were all inhibitory The lack of            inhibition by E eliminates the possibility that the            small molecule agonist activates signaling indirectly            via stimulation of Hh expression Furthermore this            supports the data showing that the agonist can activate            signaling in             Shh embryos Figure  and            suggests that the agonist function is not only            downstream of the Hh protein but also independent of            the endogenous Hhsignaling modulators Tout veloux and            HIP that act via the Hh ligand     The competition            experiment with forskolin showed identical inhibition            curves for Hh protein and the agonist strongly            suggesting that the action of the small molecule is            upstream of the proteinkinaseAsensitive step in the            pathway In contrast the competition experiments with            cyclopamine Figure d and Cur Figure e showed            that Hh protein and the agonist differ in their            sensitivity to these antagonists Specifically the            agonist appears somewhat resistant to the inhibitory            effect of cyclopamine and Cur Identical results            were seen using the slightly less active            cyclopaminerelated natural compound jervine and the            more potent synthetic derivative of cyclopamine            KAADcyclopamine data not shown These results argue            that the agonist activates the pathway downstream of            the HhPtc interaction while cyclopamine Cur and            the agonist may act at a similar level in the            Hhsignaling cascade                                Regulation of Ptc and Smo by Hh protein and Hh            agonist            Recent work in             Drosophila tissue culture has            shown that endogenous Ptc and Smo proteins are            differentially affected by the addition of Hh to the            growth medium     Ptc was destabilized while Smo            accumulated following posttranslational modification            To test whether similar phenomena occur in mammalian            cells with Hh protein and agonist we generated stable            cell lines expressing two epitopetagged proteins Ptc            coupled to green fluorescent protein PtcGFP and Smo            coupled to a fragment of influenza hemagglutinin            HASmo Figure ashows an immunoprecipitation            antiGFP plus protein blot antiPtc analysis of            extracts from these cells treated for   and  hours            with vehicle  nM Hh protein or  M Hh agonist            see Figure e HhAg  This experiment shows that            PtcGFP appears to be destabilized by Hh protein but            not by the agonist Similar results were seen at higher            doses of agonist up to  M and in several            independent lines data not shown These data further            support the idea that Hh protein and the agonist act in            distinct ways to stimulate the pathway            Figure bshows an immunoblot antiHA of total            extracts from HASmoexpressing cells treated for               and  hours with vehicle  nM Hh protein or  M            Hh agonist In contrast to the results with PtcGFP            incubation of cells with both Hh protein and the            smallmolecule agonist resulted in the apparent            accumulation of HASmo protein after  hours of            incubation To test whether the accumulation of HASmo            in response to Hh protein or the agonist required            protein synthesis a similar study was performed in the            presence of cycloheximide Figure c Under these            conditions HASmo accumulation was detectable  hours            after addition of either Hh protein or the agonist            Figure c this result argues that the effect of Hh            protein and the agonist on HASmo levels does not            require new protein synthesis Finally with increasing            concentrations of Hh protein and the agonist there is a            clear dosedependent increase of HASmo levels Figure            d These effects on epitopetagged Smo protein were            observed in multiple lines data not shown Taken            together these data suggest that Hh protein and the            agonist share the ability to stabilize Smo but only Hh            protein can destabilize Ptc Yet the agonist is fully            capable of activating the full signaling pathway                                    Testing Smo as the molecular target                      Binding in whole cells            Our biochemistry experiments above show that the            agonist modulates Smo levels and thus may activate Hh            signaling by directly binding Smo To explore this            possibility we tested whether a tritiated form of the            agonist analog HhAg  could form a complex with Smo            when Smo is transiently overexpressed in T cells            Figure ashows immunoprecipitable counts of extracts            from cells incubated at C for  hours with  nM             HHhAg  either in the absence

      addition of the unlabeled HhAg  but not the            inactive HhAg  derivative agonist control resulted            in the complete absence of counts in the immunocomplex            These results suggest that a stable specific            interaction can form between Smo and the Hh            agonist            It has been shown that the Hhpathway antagonists            cyclopamine and Cur block signaling in a            Ptcindependent manner     and therefore may act            directly on Smo Having established a binding assay for            a smallmolecule agonist binding to Smoexpressing            cells we next tested whether the Hh antagonists could            selectively compete out binding of  HHhAg  To            perform theses studies Smooverexpressing T cells            were incubated for  hours at C with  nM             HHhAg  in the presence of either            KAADcyclopamine at  M Figure a column  the            related but inactive plant compound tomatadine at  M            Figure a Antag control  column  Cur at             M Figure a column  or a related but inactive            Cur derivative Figure a Antag control  column             at  M These data show that the Hhsignaling            inhibitors but not structurally related inactive            compounds can significantly compete with the binding            of the Hh agonist to Smoexpressing cells This            supports the model that all of these smallmolecule            modulators of Hh signaling are direct ligands of            Smo            We next asked whether a derivative of the Hh agonist            carrying a photoactivatable crosslinker could be            coupled directly to Smo to facilitate further            biochemical characterization of the binding site To            perform this experiment we synthesized a tritiated            diazirine derivative of HhAg  with an EC              in the cellbased assay of  nM            data not shown We incubated this compound at  M            with HASmo or control GFPtransfected T cells and            subsequently ultravioletirradiated them to initiate            crosslinking Fractionation by SDSpolyacrylamide gel            electrophoresis and autoradiography of the resulting            immunocomplexes from these cells showed crosslinking            exclusively to HASmo but with an efficiency of less            than  data not shown This result demonstrates that            a Hhagonist derivative can be covalently crosslinked            to Smo in living cells More efficient crosslinkers are            required to extend these studies however                                Cellfree membranebinding assays            To test whether the Hh agonist could interact with            Smo             in vitro  we transiently            overexpressed murine Smo murine Ptc rat adrenergic            receptor and GFP in T cells harvested membranes and            performed a filtration membranebinding assay in a            well plate with  HHhAg  added at  nM            Figure bshows a bar graph of the bound counts from            these binding assays murine Smo column  GFP column             AR column  murine Ptc column  and a            nomembrane plate control column  The nomembrane            control column  was included to show the degree of            nonspecific binding to the filterplate apparatus The            Smocontaining membranes column  are the only            samples that exhibit significant binding above that            seen in the absence of membranes            To assess the specificity of binding we repeated            the experiment in the presence and absence of a            fold molar excess of unlabeled agonist  M The            addition of cold compound completely competed out            these counts Figure c column  compared to column             To control for this observation we added an            unlabeled inactive Hh agonist to the binding assay at             M a fold molar excess This compound was            unable to compete out the binding of  HHhAg  to            the Smocontaining membranes Figure c column             These results argue that Smo and the agonist form a            specific complex             in vitro  as predicted by the            whole cellimmunocomplex binding assay Figure a            Having established an             in vitro binding assay for the Hh            agonist to Smo we next tested whether the            Ptcindependent Hh antagonists could selectively            compete with the interaction Binding was assayed in            the presence of KAADcyclopamine at  M Figure c            column  tomatadine at  M Figure c Antag            control  column  Cur at  M

related inactive compounds can            significantly compete with the binding of the Hh            agonist to Smo membranes                                    Kinetics saturation and competition binding          analysis          Next we sought to generate association dissociation          and saturationbinding curves in order to derive          affinity constants for the interaction of the Hh agonist          and Smo To control for nonspecific binding we used          either Cur or HhAg  as unlabeled competitors          Similar results were generated if control membranes from          cells transfected with GFP AR or Ptc were used to          define the nonspecific level data not shown          First we performed a kinetic analysis to establish          the reversibility of the binding reaction and the          approximate incubation time required for equilibrium          binding studies Association assays were performed at          C by combining  nM  HHhAg  with          Smocontaining membranes for various times prior to          harvesting and counting Dissociation studies were          initiated by adding  M unlabeled HhAg  after           hours of association Samples were then incubated for           hours prior to harvesting and counting Figure          ashows the association and dissociation phases of          agonist binding to Smocontaining membranes Using the          Prism GraphPad software these data were fit to onephase          exponential association and decay curves respectively          and gave an association t of approximately  hour and a          dissociation t of approximately  hours These results          demonstrate that the binding of the agonist to Smo is          reversible and that equilibrium binding will require          binding reaction times of approximately  hours five          times the t of dissociation          Next we performed a saturation binding experiment To          establish total nonspecific and specific binding curves          Figure b we added a range of  HHhAg           concentrations  nM in the presence or absence of          unlabeled HhAg at  M Identical results were seen          if Cur at  M was used as the competitor data not          shown On the basis of the binding kinetics incubations          were carried out for approximately  hours at C to          allow for equilibrium to be reached Using the Prism          GraphPad software to perform nonlinear regression          analysis and curve fitting we concluded that the data          best fit a simple onesite binding model with a predicted          K           d of  nM for HhAg  This K           d is in general agreement with the EC            values observed in the cellbased          assay  nM as compared to  nM          To further validate our binding results we performed          a competition assay using several agonist derivatives          across a range of concentrations  nM to  M          Figure cshows the competition curves for HhAg           HhAg  HhAg  HhAg  and the          signalinginactive HhAg  derivative described above          With the exception of the inactive derivative these          compounds all compete out the binding of  HHhAg            nM to the Smocontaining membranes These data are          best fit to a singlebindingsite competition model that          predicts the following K           i values HhAg   nM HhAg            nM HhAg   nM and HhAg   nM          These K           i values are in general agreement with          the agonist EC            values in cell culture for these          compounds with the exception that the HhAg  compound          is not as potent in signaling assays EC             M as its K           i  nM might predict This suggests          an uncoupling of binding and signaling for certain          agonists Although binding affinities and signaling          efficacy can correspond for certain ligandreceptor          complexes exceptions often arise    because binding          affinity does not necessarily measure the ability of a          compound to induce an active receptor conformation As a          control for these binding studies identical competition          experiments were performed with membranes from cells          transfected with GFP or with the adrenergic receptor          No specific binding or apparent competition was seen          under these conditions data not shown          We next compared binding of KAADcyclopamine Cur          and HhAg  to a constitutively active mutant of Smo          Smo act or to wildtype Smo Smo wt The two          Hhsignaling antagonists KAADcyclopamine and Cur          have shown decreased potency on Smo actexpressing cells          leading to the speculation that they may bind this mutant          form of Smo less well than the wildtype form               We sought to determine whether the Hh agonist binds Smo          actwith a higher affinity an observation seen with          certain ligands and constitutively active mutants of          GPCRs     To perform this experiment we isolated          membranes from cells transfected with a cDNA construct          encoding a tryptophantoleucine mutation at residue           WL of murine Smo This oncogenic mutation has been          found in human basal cell carcinoma    and the          correspondingly mutated protein is capable of          ligandindependent activation of the Hh pathway in          cellculture assays     A kinetic and saturation          binding assay with Smo actcontaining membranes showed          that this mutant protein binds the Hh agonist with an          affinity identical to that of Smo wtdata not shown          Using Smo act and Smo wtcontaining membranes we          then performed competition binding studies by adding          increasing concentrations of unlabeled HhAg           KAADcyclopamine or Cur in the presence of           HHhAg   nM These binding curves Figure d          can be fit to a singlesite competition model Although          the K           i for HhAg  on Smo actcontaining          membranes was essentially identical to that observed for          Smo wtcontaining membranes approximately  nM the K                    i values of the Hh antagonists were          sevenfold higher on the Smo act compared to the Smo          wtcontaining membranes for both KAADcyclopamine           nM versus  nM and Cur  nM versus  nM          These results strongly support the model initially          hypothesized for cyclopamine     that the reduced          potency observed for Hh antagonists on Smo actexpressing          cells is directly due to a reduced affinity of the          antagonist for the mutated Smo protein The agonist on          the other hand would be predicted to bind to a site on          Smo that is not affected by this gainoffunction Smo          actmutation                            Discussion                  Models of Smoligand interaction          To interpret the results of the competition binding          studies we assume that the mutation in Smo act like          those in constitutively activate mutants of other GPCRs              indirectly influences ligand binding by creating a          change in the normal equilibrium between the different          conformations of Smo Thus the mutation would not          directly influence the binding pocket for either ligand          A simple twostate model Figure a predicts that the          agonist Ag green square and the antagonist Ant pink          circle compete for the same site on Smo to activate or          inactivate Hhpathway signaling It also suggests that          antagonists should bind Smo actwith a lower affinity than          they bind Smo wt while the agonist should bind with a          higher affinity as it prefers the active conformation          Such a model cannot accommodate our observations with the          gainoffunction Smo mutant Thus we introduce a ternary          complex model Figure b used traditionally to describe          the behavior of GPCRs in binding studies with agonist and          antagonists     as well as constitutively active          receptors     The ternary complex model for Hh          signaling suggests that there are two independent binding          sites on Smo wt one specific for the agonist and another          specific for antagonists Binding at either site would          decrease the affinity for interactions at the other site          allosteric binding with high negative cooperativity          The agonistbound form represents the normal activated          state while the antagonistbound form is considered the          inactive conformation There are also other conformations          that would not be bound or would be transiently bound          by both ligands A signaling pathway coupler or effector          in blue is proposed to bind the activated state of Smo          wtso as to generate a complex competent to initiate Hh          signaling Throughout the discussion the term          couplereffector is used to describe an unknown          molecule that binds activated Smo in such a way as to          trigger signal transduction The model further suggests          that the Smo actprotein resides in a stable conformation          in the absence of agonist that is capable of forming an          active couplereffector complex resistant to antagonist          but not agonist binding          Specifically our data suggest that the agonist binds          and stabilizes or induces an active signaling state of          Smo while the antagonists bind and stabilize or induce          an inactive form Furthermore the gainoffunction Smo          mutation renders the protein less sensitive to the          inhibitors presumably because the aminoacid          substitution directly stabilizes or induces an active          conformation On the basis of a simple twostate model          one might predict an increased affinity of the agonist          for the mutant form but in our studies binding of the          agonist unlike the antagonist is not affected by the          activating mutation suggesting that a more complex model          requiring two binding sites and perhaps multiple active          conformations is needed to account for the observations          Thus we propose a variation of the classic ternary          complex model Figure  a decadesold paradigm that          has provided the foundation for describing ligand induced          conformational changes of GPCRs              Briefly if this model is applied to Hh signaling it          proposes that firstly agonist and antagonists act at          independent sites to select active and inactive          conformations of Smo secondly that Smo engages an          undefined couplereffector when it is in its signaling          state and finally that the gainoffunction mutant form          of Smo Smo act adopts an abnormal conformation that          resembles the couplereffectorbound signaling state of          Smo with low affinity for antagonists but normal affinity          for the agonist                          Activating Hh signaling through the GPCRlike Smo          receptor          As a receptor class GPCRs are considered excellent          drug targets because they are often regulated through          interactions with small natural ligands               Specifically studies of classic GPCRs such as the          adrenergic receptors show that in the absence of          endogenous ligand agonists these receptors exist in          multiple interconvertible conformations that are          predominately inactive     Upon exposure to their          natural ligands however the active receptor forms are          preferentially stabilized allowing them to readily          engage Gprotein couplers and to create          signalingcompetent complexes Multiple compound classes          have been isolated on the basis of their ability to          compete for the binding of adrenergic receptors by          their natural ligands These competitors can mimic the          natural ligand activity agonists or interfere with it          antagonists          In addition to the binding sites for natural or          endogenous agonists orthosteric sites many GPCRs have          also been found to have allosteric sites     These          sites can bind natural ligands as in the case of Zn ions          and heparin for the dopamine and neurokinin receptors          respectively or bind synthetic drugs such gallamine in          the case of the muscarinic receptors     Binding of          small molecules to these allosteric sites can modulate          activity of a receptor without directly mimicking or          competing out the interaction of ligands to the          orthosteric sites In summary GPCRs have an array of          potential regulatory binding sites or potential drug          targets          How does Smo compare with other GPCRs with regard to          the properties described above Although there is clear          structural homology between Smo and other GPCRs          endogenous ligands have yet to be discovered Early          models of Hh signaling proposed a Hhregulated PtcSmo          complex that directly controlled the conformation of Smo          making endogenous ligands unnecessary But recent studies          argue against this stoichiometric model               indicating that perhaps natural ligands should be          considered Furthermore regarding Gproteineffector          coupling for Smo the results are also equivocal          Although no compelling data have been presented that          directly link classic Gprotein activation    to the          canonical Hh pathway involving CiGli stimulation              recent studies show that under certain conditions Smo can          engage Gprotein subunits in a Ptcdependent manner             and that Gproteinmediated cAMP modulation may          underlie certain effects of Hh on neuronal tissue                       Finally with respect to pharmacological properties          our studies indicate that Smo behaves like a classic GPCR          in many regards and that the models used to describe this          large family of receptors can be applied to Hh signaling          Figure  Two relatively novel concepts for Hh          signaling are raised by these GPCR models firstly the          importance of considering the active Smocouplereffector          complexes when modeling pathway regulation and secondly          the potential for endogenous ligands in the regulation of          Smo activity                          GPCR models for Smo and potential mechanisms of Ptc          function          A recent study in           Drosophila suggested that Hh          stimulates the pathway via Ptc degradation and as a          result Smo is stabilized through extensive          phosphorylation at the plasma membrane where it initiates          signaling     This led to speculation that a          Ptcregulated phosphatase may control the subcellular          distribution and stability of Smo     Although          suggestive the studies in           Drosophila did not establish that          phosphorylation translocation or stabilization of Smo is          required for pathway stimulation It is plausible that          some or all of these effects on Smo result from a          feedback inhibition mechanism that targets the activated          Smo receptor Interestingly while we did observe          stabilization of Smo by Hh in our mammalian cell          experiments Figure  we did not detect Smo          phosphorylation or translocation to the plasma membrane          data not shown Perhaps the cellular or species          context dictates the degree to which the active          conformations of Smo are associated with such changes          Thus in considering models of Ptc function based on          Hhstimulated effects it is important to consider whether          the form of Smo that is being observed is the active          couplereffector bound signaling state or perhaps a          downregulated and inactive form          Several potential points for regulation by Ptc during          the formation of a Smocouplereffector complex are          apparent in a ternary complex model The ideas proposed          for the           Drosophila system in which Ptc may          affect the levels of Smo or its subcellular localization          are easily accommodated Ptcinduced instability of Smo          protein would indirectly reduce the concentration of an          active Smocouplereffector complex Furthermore          limiting access of Smo to its effector through targeted          vesicle trafficking would prevent a signalingcompetent          complex from forming Alternatively Ptc could more          directly maintain Smo in an inactive state On the basis          of our studies it is tempting to speculate that native          small molecules with properties similar to our agonist          and antagonists act directly on Smo in a Ptcdependent          manner These putative endogenous Smo modulators could          represent orthosteric or allosteric ligands          The simplest model would have Ptc acting catalytically          to dock a natural antagonist directly onto or remove an          agonist from Smo A more complex model would involve Ptc          restricting the distribution of Smo such that it is          forced into compartments containing the natural          antagonists or lacking the natural agonists Finally Ptc          could control the distribution of the endogenous          smallmolecule modulators themselves Ptc shares sequence          homology with molecules associated with vesicle          trafficking and transporter activity namely SCAP and          NPC        if it also shares the activities          of these molecules as suggested by a recent study              then the possibility of the existence of endogenous Smo          ligands that are docked via Ptc should be explored                          Therapeutic potential of a Hhpathway          agonist          Various studies in mammals have shown that           Hh genes are expressed in discrete          areas of the adult organism and may function in the          normal maintenance of mature organ systems                 In addition the regenerative healing of vascular and          skeletal tissues following acute injuries appears to be          aided by reactivating the Hhsignaling cascade               Taken together these observations suggest that the Hh          pathway may represent a point of intervention for          treating certain degenerative disorders Two recent          studies in models of Parkinsons disease and peripheral          nerve damage support this claim by demonstrating that          pathway activation with a Hhprotein ligand has          therapeutic value      On the basis of our current          understanding of these models and the specific mechanism          of action of the Hh agonists we predict that an          agonistderivative with low toxicity and favorable          pharmacokinetics would replicate these positive results          As a drug a Hh agonist would represent an attractive          alternative to an expensive Hhprotein therapeutic          Beyond the economics for disorders of the central          nervous system a small molecule with the potential to          cross the bloodbrain barrier would eliminate the need          for injections directly into the brain the current          delivery mode for central nervous system protein          therapies                            Materials and methods                  Chemical libraries and medicinal chemistry          The compound libraries used in our screens were          purchased from a number of commercial vendors and were          primarily generated by combinatorial chemistry          approaches The Hhagonist class was isolated from a          library synthesized by Oxford Asymmetry International          now EvotecOAI The derivatization of this compound class          utilized standard procedures the details of which will          be published elsewhere                          Cultured cell line assays          TM and CHT cells ATCC Manassas USA were

Retroviral cell lines          Mouse           Smo and           Ptc genes were introduced by a          retroviral approach utilizing the pLPCX vector Clontech          Palo Alto USA to limit the copy number per cell Stable          HASmo and PtcGFP lines were established by puromycin          selection following infection of TM cells with the          respective retroviruses TM cells expressing both          epitopetagged Ptc and Smo were derived by infecting          first with an HASmo construct and subsequently with a          PtcGFP construct The levels of Ptc were relatively low          in these lines and a standard immunoprecipitation          procedure followed by western blotting was required to          detect the PtcGFP protein The HASmo protein was highly          expressed and was easily detected in western blots of          whole cell extracts The HA tag was subcloned into the           Smo gene so that it would reside          immediately after the Smo signal sequence The GFP tag          was inserted before the stop codon of the           Ptc open reading frame                          In uteroHhsignaling assays          Generation of           Ptc
