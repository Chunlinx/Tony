          so what do you think uh do you know any people from Puerto Rico   uh yes i i used to work with a guy from Puerto Rico when i worked for Hewlett Packard      oh really   and uh  he was a native and had gone to school there and got transferred to Colorado where i was living      uhhuh      uh and he had some interesting times getting used to it um the United States the the language was a little bit different although he did speak English   yeah have you ever been there   it was just some of the  excuse me   have you ever been there   ive never been there my dad used to work for DuPont and they built a chemical plant down there i almost moved there when i was in high school   really   yeah   no ive never been there either ive not known but just a few people from there      uhhuh   one uh there was a girl in        in my flight in in uh Air Force basic training actually who was from there   uhhuh okay        uh my dad flew down there for about a year he was down there about once a month one week per month   uhhuh   and uh        i wanted to move there it sounded like uh a neat place to live an island in the sun you know and uh   oh yeah     it turned out my mom was the only one in the family that didnt want to go because she didnt play golf or tennis  and there wasnt really a job for her there   it always sounds more oh its        i think i think everything always sounds more glamorous than it really is   yeah   every because i spent five years in Europe and everybody goes oh youre so lucky and im like well yeah sort of you know its but having lived there its not its not anything like you picture it      uhhuh    yeah    right   you know its not its like i still have the fantasies about Hawaii and all that stuff but      yeah i lived in Colorado for a while and people kept saying the same thing to me oh it must have been great      and your just like yeah well sort of right   i go oh it was just a place to live yeah i was   but um  what do you think about about um their situation should they should they become a state      i i think the status quo seems to be working i dont think um from talking to Jerry my friend that lived there that they dont seem um upset about it or anything and      yeah      i think it would upset more people if they tried to change it   really i i think        im not opposed to it but when its when the time is right it will probably just kind of happen you know   yeah i dont know fifty one stars on this flag wouldnt look too good   where are they going to put the other one      yeah if they got another state they could bring two in and fifty two might be able to uh be arranged better i dont know        well where are we where are we going to get another state      yeah i dont know cut California in half or something      or Texas no thats not a good idea      but um i know a lot of the major companies kind of like it because theyll build plants down there because they dont have to pay taxes on the stuff      oh yeah   um and they make i guess its no income tax there or federal no federal income tax something like that        oh yeah because its just a territory or is that what its called a territory   yeah    um yeah i think its a territory      okay   that makes sense        i mean theres uh lots of tiny islands in the South Pacific that are territories like that they could make states like Guam   or uh   is that a U S territory though      yeah its a U S territory and its just we own it or      that would be kind of bizarre   yeah   thats kind of far      well Hawaii is pretty far too think about it     well thats true but there is not a whole lot between here and there      yeah   where you you start dealing with Guam its like you know flying over all these other places to get there      yeah its definitely a way out of the way where  where as        My dad was stationed in Guam during the World War Two though      uhhuh        yeah where as Puerto Rico is pretty close by   yeah   which        i dont know   of course you could annex Cuba but they wouldnt like that a bit            no i dont think they would   i dont think theyd go for that   yeah        but actually i knew another guy from Puerto Rico that i went to school with   umhum   and he was coming he came to America to to go to school and i think he was going to go back be an engineer out there   oh yeah do you think   he was really funny        both of the ones i met have been really funny guys i dont know if thats uh           if thats true about all Puerto Ricans or not ones i met have been pretty pretty funny   no i have no idea but uh so you think that mostly theyre theyre pretty much satisfied with things the way they are             yeah i dont i didnt hear any major complaints about it um  i definitely think that we ought to let them decide and not say okay youre a state now or youre your own country or whatever   yeah exactly   but um let them decide   really thats why i said you know when it when when their time is right when theyre ready for it you know that it will come about      yeah    yeah        i think that makes the most sense   okay   hum   well Rick its been good talking to you   okay have we have we been on for a long enough time      i think so i think its they want like five minutes or something dont they      okay yeah this is this is actually the first time ive ive had someone call me so      oh okay     but uh        it went fine   okay byebye   all right well it was good talking to you Becky byebye
