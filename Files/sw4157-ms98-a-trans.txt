                um so what do you think   um i lived i lived in Sweden for two years and in Sweden they have socialized medicine and so i saw some of the good  and also i saw some of the bad that results from such a program   uhhuh uhhuh   uh some of the some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care   right   so its a very its a very uh comfortable i mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that you know theres no medical emergency thats going to make you destitute for life   right   um the bad was more apparent i think at least for me because i think it affected peoples lives on in a way that you could see one one thing that i noticed is its very very convenient to be alcoholic in Sweden   oh really   because its treated as a disease now i dont know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine but uh if youre  if youre alcoholic then youre treated as if youre on disability longterm disability and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that   hum   also um another thing that that i noticed that was very strange i was uh i would go down all these uh i remember this one row of houses and they were uh row houses or townhouses all connected together so it was like lower middleclass housing well itd be lower middleclass housing here its probably   umhum   middleclass housing there um and there was a taxi driver that lived in one of these and there was a doctor that lived in one of these the one guy was a doctor and one was a taxi driver and so   uhhuh   their their incomes were about the same   hum   whereas here theres a great incentive to be a doctor because theres a great financial reward and that that didnt exist in Sweden   right right   and uh overall i guess their their health care suffered a fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower and it was it was less professional and it was treated more like a like a taxi driver type job then a then a doctor type job   yeah i that is uh that is something ive heard i i had a friend uh that i worked with that was from Sweden and that was uh probably the major the major concern i have is that you know we are leading in the technology realm of of medicine just because it is such a great incentive to to get into uh the medical field but at the same time um its real hard i mean my husband works for a company that provides insurance and so you know im real you know its like well you know you know theres got to be better ways you know to do some things but you know i hate to uh the the competition in in a lot of ways is is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor and and uh they have to compete to be to be good and to be knowledgeable but at the same time theres a you know theyre regulating themselves and and the hospitals are charging just enormous amounts for products that they dont have to pay very much for my i have a brother whos a vet and for something that he can get you know wholesale and im sure they can get a lot cheaper because they they hospitals buy in such a bulk rate um   right   you know they could charge you twenty dollars for a dollar fifty item and thats ridiculous and i dont think that is that is um abnormal in any means to be doing things like that and   you dont think its abnormal   i dont think that is that is uh abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all   oh i see youre not saying its right youre just saying its common   it yeah and so it it its i think i to me i think uh something thats going to help our medical uh arena is for um uh and i dont know how to i dont know how to do this but i think people are too lawsuit happy and i mean things will happen and and youve got to uh keep up or youve got to realize that you know uh it is just men or women that are that are making um decisions and they will make mistakes and   you know if if people you know uh there are some people that im sure make mistakes because they just dont keep on top of it but there are other things that just happen that you cant you know you cant say you know well if you had just done this you know things would have done differently and um i dont know i i think the fact that malpractice has gone up i think has raised our prices just dramatically um in in the in the last number of years and i think thats something that if if they could work on   yes   the cause of that and
