        uh it was about the Vietnam right     the Vietnam War   yeah well uh guess uh im twenty three are you older than i am   yeah im forty one so i would uh   so you probably have a better opinion of of what   well i uh was in college when the war escalated to its height and uh   huh   i guess my feeling is consistent with that of uh the general public that it was unfortunate event uh its real interesting to think about it in the context of this new movie JFK which is   right   apparently linking the Kennedy assassination to his decision to his uh uh the apparently people uh who worked for Kennedy say he didnt decide that he was gonna   umhum   pull out of Vietnam was not going to commit more troops that that had nothing to do with the assassination of those people say but they that he had come to that conclusion   um yeah   i think it was uh particularly in light of recent events a really unfortunate mistake Communism was self destructing even then and uh the history of Vietnam which has been uh represented in a number of different commentaries and documentaries one on the public broadcasting system uh it seems that it just didnt have to happen and i think uh its a valuable uh if painful lesson for this country   yeah i mean looking back now know what we know now i mean it was just a complete disaster   right at the time i wasnt that uh wasnt that sure i i i really didnt know enough about it and wasnt that politically active uh but it was um apparently something that couldve been avoided and i you know i i look at wars generally as falling into that category um people are beginning to wonder whether or not the uh the Gulf War couldve been avoided even though that was a remarkably painless war and as wars go   umhum yeah i just think that the Gulf War was just something that was really um i know its i kind of look at it as a little bit of propaganda in a way because i mean we basically went in and spent i dont know how many billions of dollars and   right   just beat up on a   third world country really   inferior yeah inferior army that was just wanting wanting to quit and didnt have any food and i mean its just i dont know how much pride one can really take in that and   well i think what whats uh i i guess id use the word relevant to the Vietnam War question is that the Vietnam War was apparently avoidable too it was a time when Ho Chi Minh apparently came to the United States and said look if youre willing to provide me with support all i wanna do is unify Vietnam   umhum   and uh he was turned away by Truman um so its hum a painful lesson i guess one that were beginning to learn im really impressed by how much effect some of these movies have had on public consciousness the JFK movies cause causing one person after another to call for the release of the documents that have been sealed   oh yeah thats just um   did you see any of the Vietnam Wars um any of the Vietnam war movies   ive seen uh you know Apocalypse Now and um uh what was the one with um Christopher Waken and um   oh the Deer Hunter   The Deer Hunter yeah ive you know and the just a lot of other i guess inferior ones made but i mean as far i think Apocalypse Now and um Deer Hunter were just   yeah those two yep   just incredible movies you know Deer Hunters a little bit more of a incident but   yeah they were theyve yeah well they were both remarkable films as a matter of fact theres a new film out about the Vietnam War about the making of Apocalypse Now which itself is suppose to be a great yeah have you is it good   yeah Heart of Darkness yeah ive seen that that was uh its great they had it on Showtime um  before they released it to theaters fact around the summer and uh its really something its almost it its just as entertaining if not more entertaining than a film is because its   thats what people say im really looking forward to seeing his wife apparently made it from documentary   right she just shot documentary you know had like a little hand held camera and you know the whole things been edited together but when Martin Sheen had his heart attack its just amazing what you know Frances is just   oh is is that on film did that that get captured on film   it it doesnt capture the actual event it captures him getting uh some treatment after it happened but she had a tape reporter running when he was talking on the phone about it and hes just literally freaking out i mean about hes more concerned about the you know how because hes as the whole time i guess when it was being made um i was just a kid back then but i guess its just the people back in America just were hearing about it how it was just such a disaster during this is like the last thing he need is is for Marty to have a heart attack i mean youll youll love it i mean its its really great um   right right right yeah well i  the thing i think is really neat about
