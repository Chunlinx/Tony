                    Background        Glucocorticoids influence a wide spectrum of cellular        functions through their action on soluble intracellular        receptors In most cells unliganded glucocorticoid        receptors GR reside predominately in the cytoplasm where        they exist as a heteromeric complex comprised minimally of        GR kDa and kDa heat shock proteins hsp and        hsp Other proteins ie pHop p hsp FKBP        and FKBP have been implicated in the        assemblystabilization of the GRhsphspcomplex in a        form that has high affinity for agonist for review see        Ref    Upon agonist binding the complex undergoes        a transformation and the ligand bound GR translocates into        to the nucleus in a manner that is determined by a nuclear        localization sequence NLS contained in the receptor          There the GR acts as a ligandactivated transcriptional        stimulator or repressor of primary response genes by        binding to glucocorticoid hormoneresponsive elements GRE        contained in the promoter regions of steroidresponsive        genes and either facilitating or repressing the formation        of an active transcriptional complex        Although little is known about the molecular machinery        that regulates steroid receptor movement through the        cytoplasm and into the nucleus several studies suggest        that movement is influenced by reversible phosphorylation        Evidence for this originated from the studies of Qi et al           which revealed that the hormone insensitivity        produced by cellular transformation with vmos a        serinethreonine protein kinase that acts as an oncogene        results from both a decrease in the nuclear retention of        liganded receptor and a decrease in the reutilization of GR        protein that cycles back into the cytoplasm Subsequently        DeFranco et al   reported that treatment with okadaic        acid a potent serthr protein phosphatase inhibitor also        results in inefficient nuclear retention of agonistbound        GR and the cytoplasmic trapping of GR in a form that is        unable to recycle Recent studies with okadaic acid        suggest phosphorylation alters the high affinity binding of        GR to hsp and that an intact cytoskeleton is required        for ligandactivated GR translocation through the cytoplasm        to the nucleus          The ability of okadaic acid to influence the        intracellular partitioning of GR suggests that an okadaic        acid sensitive serthr protein phosphatase PPase        participates in the regulation of GR movement In vitro        okadaic acid acts as a potent inhibitor of serinethreonine        protein phosphatases type  PP and A PPA           Accordingly many of the effects produced by the treatment        of cells with okadaic acid have been attributed to the        inhibition of these two enzymes However due to toxicity        and solubility constraints in living cells it is difficult        to distinguish the actions of PPA from those of PP using        okadaic acid Furthermore in humans it is now clear that        there are four isoforms of PP PP PP PP          and PP              two isoforms of PPA        PPA  and PPA    and four structurally related        phosphatases PP   PP    PP   and PP          Although detailed doseresponse studies have not been        reported for native PP PP and PP studies with PP          and recombinant PP   indicate they are also        sensitive to okadaic acid Like calcineurin PPB and        PPC PP is apparently insensitive to inhibition by        okadaic acid          Recent studies indicate that PP associates with the        GRhsp complex    suggesting that PP may        influence the actions of GRs However studying the        cellular roles of PP has proven difficult in part        because no physiological substrates for PP have been        identified In addition in crude cell homogenates PP        resides predominately in an inactive state that represents         of the measurable PPase activity To characterize        the cellular roles of PP we have therefore developed        chimeric antisense          O methoxy ethylphosphothioate        oligonucleotides capable of inhibiting the expression of        human PP at nanomolar concentrations Because the lead        compound targeting PP ISIS  acts via RNAase H        mediated degradation studies with ISIS  do not allow        us to assess how rapid changes in PP activity affect        cellular functions Northern analysis indicate that it        takes   for the mRNA degradation to occur and due to the        halflife of the preexisting protein it takes   hours        for the protein levels to fall   Nonetheless ISIS         potently inhibits the expression of PP in cultured        cells for   hours IC          of  nm which affords a          hour window in which the expression of PP is        essentially ablated    More importantly because        ISIS  has no effect on the structurally related PPases          it can be employed to specifically inhibit the        actions of PP by suppressing PP protein levels in        cultured human cells        To assess the role of PP in the regulation of        GRmediated events binding studies were conducted with         Hdexamethasone before and after ISIS mediated        suppression of PP expression These studies revealed that        the suppression of PP expression had no apparent effect on        dexamethasone binding suggesting that PP does not affect        the formation of the highaffinity ligand binding complex        or hormone binding to the GR   In contrast mobility        gelshift analysis revealed that treatment with ISIS         produces a marked increase in the association of GR with        GREcontaining DNA and transient transfection studies        employing a GRresponsive reporter plasmid revealed that        the suppression of PP expression activates GRdependent        transcription in the absence of hormone   When A        cells were treated with ISIS  and then dexamethasone        the effect was additive with maximal dexamethasone induced        luciferase activity   times greater than the maximal        dexamethasoneinduced response attainable in the presence        of PP   Together these studies indicate that PP        acts as a suppressor of GRinduced transcription        To further characterize the mechanism by which PP        affects GR function in the present study we employed a        GRGFP fusion protein and fluorescent microscopy to follow        the movement of GR in cells treated with dexamethasone and        ISIS  These studies indicate that PP mediated        suppression of GRfunction arises from the ability of PP        to suppress the nuclear accumulation of GRs                    Results                  Inhibition of PP by okadaic acid          Okadaic acid is widely employed to inhibit PPase          activity in eukaryotic cells and the observed effects          are often attributed to the inhibition of PP and PPA          However as seen in Figure  the dephosphorylation of          phosphohistone by the catalytic subunit of purified PP          from bovine brain is also potently inhibited by okadaic          acid Okadaic acid inhibits the activity of PP in a          dosedependent manner having an IC            of    nM Under          identical assay conditions okadaic acid is a more potent          inhibitor of PPA IC              nM and weaker inhibitor of          PP IC              nM However the activity of          PP against histone    nMoles Piminmg protein          is less than that of PPA Therefore whereas assays          conducted with PP and PPA were conducted with a          concentration of enzyme that is diluted below the          titration endpoint defined as the concentration of          enzyme after which further dilution no longer affects the          IC               because the activity of          PP upon further dilution was below that necessary for          accurate quantification we could not establish a clear          titration endpoint with PP Based on titration studies          with microcystinLR to estimate the actual amount of PP          in the reaction an estimate of the K           i for okadaic acid is             nM Still it should be kept in mind that the true K           i may be slightly lower Nonetheless          it is clear that PP is sensitive to inhibition by          okadaic acid at the concentrations that also affects the          activity of PP and PPA Therefore when okadaic acid is          employed to treat cells at a concentration of  nM          the activity of PP is also affected                          ISIS  promotes nuclear localization of          GR          To determine whether the suppression of PP activity          influenced the subcellular distribution of GR plasmids          expressing a GRGFP fusion protein were microinjected          into cells that were previously treated with ISIS           In these studies the GRGFP used was derived from the          fusion of GFP to a GR mutant that retained the ability to          bind agonist translocate to the nucleus and bind DNA          but lacked transactivation activity   When plasmids          expressing the GRGFP were injected into the nuclei of          cells and the cells were grown in serumcontaining          medium the majority of the expressed GRGFP localized to          the nuclei of the injected cells as expected due to the          presence of glucocorticoids in the serum Thus after          microinjection the cells were grown in medium          supplemented with serum for  to  hours and then serum          starved overnight to cause the redistribution of GRGFP          In the absence of serum GRGFP localized throughout the          cells with equal intensity in both the nucleus and          cytoplasm Fig A Upon treatment of these cells with          dexamethasone  nM for  minutes the GRGFP          efficiently translocated to the nucleus To assess the          role of PP in the intracellular partitioning of GR          cells were treated with ISIS  or a mismatched          control ISIS  at a concentration of  nM which          essentially ablates PP expression in A cells after           hours    Approximately  hours after antisense          treatment the cells were microinjected with pGRAlaGFP          and subjected to serumstarvation as described above In          cells treated with the mismatch control prior to          microinjection GRGFP expression was indistinguishable          from that in untreated cells GRGFP was distributed          evenly throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus Figure A          In contrast following treatment with ISIS  GRGFP          was localized in the nucleus without dexamethasone          treatment The percentage of cells displaying          predominantly nuclear GRGFP or cytoplasmic GRGFP from           independent experiments were tabulated and are presented          in Figure B In control cells in the absence of          dexamethasone  of the cells showed          nuclearcytoplasmic localization of GRGFP Similarly           of the cells treated with mismatch oligonucleotide          displayed greater nuclear than cytoplasmic localization          of GRGFP By contrast the percentage of cells showing          more nuclear than cytoplasmic distribution of GRGFP was              and   in cells treated with either          dexamethasone ISIS  or ISIS  and          dexamethasone respectively These results suggest that          PP plays a role in the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning          of GR                          Inhibition of PP expression does not globally          affect nuclear shuttling          The ability of ISIS  treatment to induce the          nuclear accumulation of GRGFP suggests that PP          influences the subcellular distribution of GR          Alternatively PP could have a more global role          possibly regulating entire nuclear transport pathways To          test the latter the effect of PP suppression on the          nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of another transcription          factor NFAT was investigated In these studies a          stable GFPNFAT expressing HeLa cell line was employed            As seen in Figure  in the absence of any drug the          GFPNFAT protein is localized entirely within the          cytoplasm Upon treatment with the calcium ionophore          ionomycin GFPNFAT translocates rapidly to the nucleus          The fusion protein then relocates to the cytoplasm if the          drug is washed out of the cells for  hours When the          GFPNFAT HeLa cells were treated with ISIS  the          distribution of GFPNFAT was indistinguishable from          untreated cells or cells treated with mismatched control          oligonucleotides Northern analysis confirmed the ability          of ISIS  to suppress PP expression in Hela cells          Therefore the results indicate that suppression of PP          expression does not have a global effect on all nuclear          shuttling proteins                            Discussion        Like other steroid hormone receptors GRs are        phosphoproteins and reversible phosphorylation of specific        serthr residues on the GR or associated proteins has been        implicated in the regulation of  hormone binding to the        cytoplasmic GRcomplex  the translocation of the GR        between the cytoplasm and the nucleus  the binding of        ligand activated GR to consensus GRE in the promoter        regions of GRresponsive genes and  the formation of an        active transcriptional complex                   Many of the kinases that catalyze the        phosphorylation of GRs and associated proteins have been        identified However little is known about the PPases that        must also participate in the regulation of GRmediated        signaling networks        Several recent studies indicate that PP participates in        the regulation of GRinduced gene expression First        dexamethasoneinduced transcription is markedly enhanced        when the expression of PP is suppressed by treatment with        ISIS    Second both coimmunoprecipitation        studies and studies with mutant forms of PP indicate that        PP associates with the GRhsp complex           However binding assays revealed that the suppression of        PP expression has no apparent effect on  Hdexamethasone        binding   Therefore PP appears to act as a        suppressor of GRinduced gene expression via a mechanism        that does not alter receptor number or the binding of        hormone to the GR To further characterize the relationship        between PP and GR in the present study we employed a        GRGFP fusion protein to track the movement of GRs in A        cells following treatment with hormones or ISIS         These studies revealed that in the absence of        glucocorticoids GRGFP localized mainly in the cytoplasm        As expected treatment with dexamethasone results in the        efficient translocation of GRGFPs into the nucleus        Nuclear accumulation of GRGFP was also observed when the        expression of PP was suppressed by treatment with ISIS         after   hours This translocation of GRGFP        occurred without the addition of glucocorticoids and in the        presence of serum free media Thus in the absence of        physiological concentrations of PP GRs accumulate in the        nucleus of A cells This finding is consistent with data        obtained from gelshift analysis and transfection studies        conducted with GRreporter plasmids where a decrease in        PP levels facilitates the association of GR with DNA and        produces an increase in GRtransactivation   Together        these studies suggest that the increase in GRinduced        transcriptional activity observed when the expression of        PP is suppressed by treatment with ISIS  results from        the nuclear accumulation of GR        The mechanism by which PP suppresses the nuclear        accumulation of GR is not clear The current data is        consistent with PP acting to suppress the nuclear import        of GRs Alternatively the data is also consistent with PP        acting to promote the nuclear export of the GRs Because        the effects of ISIS  treatment are not readily        reversible the washout experiments needed to distinguish        between these two possibilities cannot be conducted until a        specific and reversible inhibitor of PP is developed        Recent studies indicate that okadaic acid inhibits        nuclear transport mediated by import receptors importin         and transportin suggesting that an okadaic acid sensitive        phosphatase participates in a mechanism that negatively        regulates entire nuclear transport pathways   Since        PP is sensitive to inhibition by okadaic acid we tested        the possibility that PP acted at a more global level by        assessing the effect of ISIS  on the cellular        distribution of NFATGFP In contrast to the findings        obtained with GRGFP the suppression of PP expression had        no apparent effect on calcium induced nuclear import or the        subsequent export of NFATGFP Figure  Therefore PP        does not appear to regulate entire nuclear transport        pathways                    Conclusions        These studies indicate that PP participates in the        regulation of GR nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and that the        suppression of PP expression results in the nuclear        accumulation of GR in the absence of hormone Therefore        the previously reported increase in GRinduced        transcriptional activity that occurs after ISIS         induced suppression of PP expression likely results from        the nuclear accumulation of GR in a form that is capable of        binding DNA yet still requires agonist to elicit maximal        transcriptional activation Still it is not yet clear if        PP acts to suppress the nuclear accumulation or to        facilitate the nuclear export of GRs Thus the precise        molecular mechanism by which PP suppresses the nuclear        accumulation of GR remains to be elucidated                    Materials

substrate                          GRGFP expression vectors          A mutant rat glucocorticoid receptor that retained          hormone binding nuclear translocation activity and          specific DNA binding activity but was incapable of          transactivation was fused to a ST mutant of green          fluorescent protein to create pGRAlaGFP GRAlaGFP          expression is driven by the CMV immediate early promoter          and enhancer All manipulations were performed as          described and all constructs were confirmed by          sequencing   Proteinfree plasmid DNA was purified          using Qiagen maxiprep columns San Diego CA and          contained predominantly supercoiled plasmid with no          contaminating RNA or low molecular weight          contaminants                          GFPGR translocation          Cells were plated on etched coverslips and grown until          the cultures were    confluent The cells were then          either treated with oligonucleotides as described above          or left untreated Eighteen hours later purified          proteinfree pGRAlaGFP suspended in phosphatebuffered          saline  mgml was microinjected into the nuclei of          the cells   Typically  cells were injected          for each condition After microinjection the cells were          incubated in medium containing  FBS for  hours at          C The cells were then washed several times with          serumfree media and placed in serum deficient media for           hours to prevent GFPGR translocation to the nucleus          prior to treatment with  nM dexamethasone  min or          with vehicle alone The cells were washed  times with          PBS fixed by incubation in PBS supplemented with            paraformaldehyde for  min and washed again  times with          PBS before mounting on slides with DABCODAPI mounting          solution GRGFP expression and localization were          monitored by fluorescence microscopy Nuclei were          localized by DAPI staining Images were captured with an          Optronics cooled CCD camera and imported into Adobe          Photoshop The experiments were repeated  times  for          control Oneway ANOVA was performed to determine          statistical significance of the results using Instat           GraphPad Software San Diego CA                          GFPNFAT nuclear shuttling assay          Stablytransfected HeLa cells expressing GFPNFAT            were grown on glass coverslips to approximately           confluency and either left untreated or treated with          ISIS  or ISIS  a mismatched oligonucleotide          control for ISIS  in the absence of serum as          described above Four hours later FBS was added to           and the cells were grown for an additional  hours The          cells were then treated with  M ionomycin for           minutes after which time they were either fixed          immediately or washed extensively with PBS and incubated          for  hours in medium lacking the drug washout          Control cells were not incubated with ionomycin GFPNFAT          localization was monitored by fluorescence microscopy          and images were captured with an Optronics cooled CCD          camera and imported into Adobe Photoshop
