          okay   so whos your uh favorite team   who do you think  the Dallas Cowboys   the Dallas Cowgirls huh   yeah   well  they did have a fairly decent year finally this year   umhum   at least theyre coming around   yeah theyre going to get better i mean you know   well i mean you know i think uh once Jimmy Johnson gets his system established uh theyll do all right   yeah as long as Troy  Aikman doesnt get hurt again that kind of killed them at the end of the season last year   umhum   so i dont i dont even know who your favorite team is actually   im a Viking fan   okay i think i did know that i just forgot okay   and they havent been doing too hot so   yeah has Herschel Walker done much for them   no in fact in fact the Cowboys got the best end of that deal   definitely well he was a good player i guess i dont know he just never i dont know for a while there he just   ive never been over impressed with him   well he could always get past you know hed get past like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone but um i guess you never could really see him play because with the Cowboys while he was with the team the rest of the team was pretty poor so you couldnt really tell if it was just him or the team and i always just assumed he was too good for the rest of the team but i dont know   well whos the running back is it Sammy Smith or is it Emmitt Smith Emmitt Smith   Emmitt Smith yeah hes been doing real good im pretty impressed with him so far did he did he actually play in the Pro Bowl i remember he was like a backup and then somebody got injured and he was supposed to go   yeah im not sure   yeah i kind of i havent been keeping up with football i mean in the fall i i can go on and on about football but since its kind of off season its kind of hard to think back about all that but uh     uh who else is uh uh theres you know Mike Lynn from the Minnesota Vikings he used to be the general manager starting the World Football League   yeah   some uh and that and he was trying to keep uh uh uh i cant even think of the guys name either the coach of the Vikings   um i have no idea   Burt Jerry Burns   no earthly idea   going to keep  he was going to keep him as the coach somehow but uh i dont know id like to see the Vikings get revamped somehow   how did they end up this year did they did they make it to the playoffs at all   well they started out really bad they went like one and six and then they won five or six in a row   um umhum   so they were in a shot to make the playoffs and they screwed up the last couple of games   kind of like the Cowboys huh   yep i guess you can   except i think the Cowboys are on the upswing i dont know about the Vikings     yeah   just hadnt heard much about them lately   and the Cardinals were kind of like the Cowboys in fact they were doing better than the Cowboys and the Cowboy Cowboys came on strong at the end of the season and the Cardinals got killed by the Cowboys so   yeah well the Cardinals i dont know  i think the Cowboys probably have a a better team they just at the end of the season the kind of got messed up with Aikman getting hurt because uh Laufenberg just couldnt never really get it together at all of course he sat along the sidelines all season he never really got in a game never did a whole lot   oh dont make any excuses for him   well im just saying i shouldnt i shouldnt blast him like that say oh well Laufenberg got out there and blew it for them i mean he didnt get to see much action but its too bad because now now you know he had a shot and and didnt look too good and so no one is going to have much faith in him any more   umhum   in fact i think theyre getting a different guy for a backup quarterback i havent uh i havent kept up with it lately but i remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on or or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody but it wasnt anybody id really heard of but i heard on the radio this morning or yesterday morning that uh Aikmans back in practicing doing real real well um who is it Michael Irvin   uhhuh   he said that uh Aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time so sounds like hes going to be all right for next season theyre just trying not to overwork him right now until he gets his shoulder uh back in shape it was his shoulder wasnt it  that he had problems with   i dont know  yeah think it was   i think it i think it was his shoulder he had surgery on but anyway theyre trying to keep him you know keep him uh from reinjuring anything but anyway   but uh well i got my uh thirty day notice yesterday   thirty day notice for what   um im done where i work   oh really   so anyway i guess we cant talk much more about that but i just thought id throw that in there   what  oh okay  maybe ill call you back after  after the recording is finished actually i think we have talked about football for five minutes i i cant remember   oh we ive always ran out of time ever since ive done this   really i usually have too   they always say youve talked your ten minute limit   yeah ive done that once or twice i didnt look at the clock when we started talking so i guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in   make sure we get our cash flow   yeah       so other than the Vikings who do you like   um actually when i was younger i was a Cardinal fan too remember Jim Hart   uh oh   Jim Hart was playing Terry Metcalf was on the Cardinals this was a long time ago   yeah   uh i dont know who else ive ever thats about it i was always a Viking fan i think i was into the Cardinals for a little bit   umhum back when they were in Saint Louis   and and yeah oh of course   since theyve been to Phoenix they havent been uh all that impressive i guess i guess ive always been a Cowboy fan other than that i mean you know when ive you know when you grow up in a city that has the you know one of the greatest football teams until the last few years you kin d of tend to   yeah well the Cowboys were Americas football team theres no question about that so   get caught up in it yeah yeah i mean it it was really exciting growing up when when the Cowboys were really big because my parents would always have season tickets and theyd go to all the games and       you know the hype were just unbelievable its just you know the last oh i guess probably since about eighty four about eighty five was when they started kind of going downhill really but you know im just used to always growing up and hearing Cowboys Cowboys Cowboys and you know Super Bowl and all this other stuff so i cant you know im not going to decide i dont like them just because theyre having a few bad years i mean i think theyll pull out of it and you know theyll theyll wind up being good again theyve got some lot of really good young players that are going to that are going to uh do pretty good i think but theyre raising prices on their tickets so theyre banking on doing good next season   again what are they going up to thirty bucks or something   i think tickets are yeah thirty or thirty two for really good tickets see they they sectioned it out even more they used to just have like uh first of all it was all one price and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else and now theyre sectioning it off to like from the from one twenty yard line to the other one just on the lower levels is the highest price and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line and then theyre some sections kind of in the corner areas and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end the direct end zones but um they have about four or five different prices now that theyre structuring it with but obviously yeah theyre all going up even more or less is what its going to do   so now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year   um you know im not sure im not positive i didnt i didnt really think about that i just remember trying to figure out where you could get that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper but not that ill ever go i hadnt been to a Cowboys game last time last time i went to the Cowboys game was during that um NFL strike or the when they had the scab team teams in there and it was the uh Dallas and Washington Redskins game and i went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets because a lot of those doctors have season tickets and they um if theyre not going to use them theyll give them to somebody else so my dad i went with my dad to a game that one time but that wasnt a real you know it was it was the scab teams it was kind of you know it was kind of different i guess and before that its been quite a few years ive been wanting to go to a game i just never never have gotten around to it so maybe this year Texans  cheap cheaper i guess   thats interesting i almost lost our electricity here
