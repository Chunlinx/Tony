                                 Jesus H Christ            The most electric moments inCorpus Christi  Terrence McNallys play about a gay Jesus come when youarrive at the theater Across the street Catholic protestors in white beretsrecite Hail Marys into a megaphone If you approach the police barricade thatpens them in they ply you with leaflets charging that the play portrays theBlessed Virgin screaming obscenely to St Joseph for sexual relations sadlyit doesnt Thanks to the controversy the entire run at the  seatManhattan Theatre Club is sold out Should you manage to lay hands on a ticketyou have to run a gauntlet of burly security guards and pass through an airportmetal detector to get to your seat            Theexperience is disorientingpart First Amendment vigil part Xrated movieCorpus Christi became instantaneously notorious in May when the NewYork Post revealed that it depicted a Jesus who has sex with his apostlesAfter receiving telephone calls threatening violence the Manhattan TheatreClub canceled the production But the play was reinstated a week later amidprotests from nearly every important dramatist in America and many elsewhereSince restoring the play the Manhattan Theatre Club has been congratulatingitself on its fearless defense of free expression            What a letdown then to finally see Corpus Christiand encounter neither blasphemy nor artistic courage On the first score theplay comes up short It is not in fact a work of savage or even mildanticlericalism in the tradition of the Marquis de Sade whose every thirdscene involves priests and nuns performing unspeakable acts or the films ofLuis Buuel most famously Viridiana  with its infamous parody of theLast Supper tableau Theres no nudity or sex onstage and though the Vaticanregards the notion of a noncelibate gay Jesus as heretical the playwrightsintention is not sacrilegious McNallys updating of the life of Jesus is muchin the spirit of Godspell if slightly more risqu But while theresnothing very shocking about Corpus Christi  its dramatic andintellectual thinness is stunning McNallys real offense is invoking a greattheme and an allimportant principle for something as trite and banal asthis            The playis in essence a gay retelling of the Gospel Thirteen male actors perform avariety of parts in a series of sketches In the first Joshua a k a Jesus isborn in a sleazy East Texas motel room the woman screaming for sex is on theother side of a thin wall At sera Pontius Pilate High in CorpusChristi Texasthe town where McNally grew upJoshua is bullied into playingfootball and taunted by his peers as a faggot An encounter in the schoolbathroom leads to an affair with a sinister classmate named Judas Aftergraduation Joshua hitchhikes across the desert and has occasionalconversations with his dad God He performs miracles and gathers disciplesOne is a doctor another an actor another a male prostitute They go to gaydiscos and spread the Word Joshua performs a marriage for two of the apostlesAfter a scrumptious Last Supper Judas betrays him with a French kissOn the cross Joshua is mocked as King of the Queers            The staging and performances are competent ifuninspired The real limitations are those of the writer whose hallmarks areweak sophomoric humor and a cloying sentimentality Its a gag line in thisplay when someone exclaims Jesus H Christ Joseph opposes naming his sonJesus because people will thing hes a Mexican I hear hammering Jesustells his mother Of course you do she says Your fathers a carpenterThis is silly and not really funny but the intent is not to ridicule Thespirit is rather one of camp reverence McNally who was raised a Catholicapparently considers himself in sympathy with the deeper meaning ofChristianity which he boils down to an injunction to be nice to everybody Hissetting is supposed to teach us that Jesus loves gay people too Lest anyonemiss the point one of the apostles appears onstage to explain it to theaudience after the crucifixion If we have offended so be it he declaresHe belongs to us as well as you            This isweak Christian tea Equally pallid is McNallys stereotyped portrayal of gaypeople Like many of his other plays Corpus Christi seems like ethnicPR in the vein of Fiddler on the Roof or the movie Moonstruck McNally wants to present homosexuals to heterosexuals as witty and wonderfulThough his gay characters arent always perfect the overall picture is of adelightful bunch of fellas Gay men have flair taste and humor They loveCallas and cooking They are sensitive and deep            Where McNally fails time and again is by drawing gay peopleas types rather than complex characters Watch the clip from the filmversion of Frankie and Johnny  for which McNally wrote the screenplaybased on his own theater play Michelle Pfeiffers gay nextdoor neighborplayed by Nathan Lane is a cutup whose jokes are usually variations of thetheme of being a man who likes other men In another McNally playturnedfilmthe maudlin soap opera Love Valour Compassion  Jason Alexander mincesaround puts on womens clothes and continually bursts into show tunes Watchas he riffs on those annoying heterosexuals In Corpus Christi the disciple characters are thinly sketched versions of familiar clichs thetaciturn hairdresser the buff male hustler the yuppie lawyer This may beBethlehem but its still The Birdcage             By focusing on the fact thatthe play portrays a Christ who has sex with his disciples the press hasencouraged a misconception about McNallys work Most people now assume thatCorpus Christi is an expression of ACTUPstyle radicalismthe theaterof queer outrage performed with an NEA grant But McNally wants to enlarge thebourgeoisie not pater it Corpus Christi  like his other playsis a work of unchallenging middlebrow subscription theater on a touchy themeOf course theres nothing wrong with middlebrow theater if done well NeilSimon has his place But Neil Simon doesnt congratulate his audience for beingbrave enough to laugh at his jokes And Neil Simon can be funny            The producers of the playbasking in the glow of First Amendment martyrdom have not done much to clearup the misunderstanding During last springs controversy McNallys agentGilbert Parker was quoted complaining that no journalist had bothered torequest a copy of the script of Corpus Christi  When I called to ask forone Parkers office told me that it wasnt releasing it I dont think theplaywright or the theater wants people to know that the play is largelyinoffensive The frisson of blasphemy has resulted in an overflowinghouse But were the Philistines at the barricades allowed inside I fear theywould find little to stoke their furyor hold their interest
