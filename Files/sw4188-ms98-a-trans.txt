              okay want to go ahead and start then   sure uh recycling in this community has uh been a problem for the past two years i moved down here two years ago from a community that had had recycling band this particular town uh does not offer municipal trash services so we are all uh under obligation to get our own trash hauled away       and when i talk to the local trash haulers about recycling they said that uh they could haul it to the recycling site but it would be about twenty dollars a month more       so it was uh fairly amazing to me that this thing that they are trying to mandate throughout the state uh was being snubbed in this particular town   hum wow do you guys have like recycling bins   no   for your glass and stuff like that   no we dont uh as i said we we are responsible for finding our own trash pick up   hum   and all the uh trash haulers in this area will take the uh the sorted trash and bring the recyclables to a uh a recycling center but they charge twenty dollars or more a month for that particular service   ill be darned down down here in  isnt too much of a tax burden up here down here its uh they have uh the the garbage company picks it up for us and they what we do is we have to separate this stuff you know papers and and plastic materials and glass   umhum right   and uh theyll theyll come by in a separate truck and i guess its paid for with taxpayers money   right   but up there i guess you guys are saving the tax payers uh   well uh it its interesting because this uh the town i live in is a a coastal town that uh during the summer really is a uh a tourist resort type town and uh the population really drops off in the winter so they uh i guess they figure that they wouldnt uh they wouldnt provide that particular service   oh i see yeah   uh when i when i lived back up uh closer to the city it we had the municipal trash pick up and we sorted the bottles the paper and all of that and uh you know id had about a year or so to get used to that whole system and i moved down and i said this is a great you know i like doing this its not that much of a pain um it sounds good to me what do i do to keep doing this and the answer was you can if you want but its going to cost you   yeah   so i i was fairly surprised   yeah thats it is surprising but it sounds like youre in uh are you near the ocean and stuff then or   yes   uh so you are in a nice place   well i really do like it here uh i   yeah im im close to the ocean myself im in Juno here   umhum   and uh its its its pretty nice  about uh probably a half mile from the beach im not right on it but uh im pretty close to   right im about im about uh maybe uh quarter of a mile to a half a mile away   yeah thats pretty good thats pretty good   but uh the the other thing about recycling that had uh that ive noticed is ive seen a few articles in the paper now that uh theres more recycled material than people know what to do with       uh apparently the uh the uh the manufacturer glass people the plastics the paper people the glass people arent using enough of the recyclables to uh to keep the chain going so theres a a back log of of material that was put in for recycling that no one knows what to do with and its actually   hum was that a uh was that a beverage manufacturer that uh wrote that article   i dont know i ive seen it a couple of times and im im i couldnt cite the source  right now umhum right right well its true we uh in this state dont have a bottle bill and every time its raised there is uh that lobby that keeps it down and i its i i really cant see why people would get that upset about it because once its in place it doesnt seem all that uh that difficult to manage
