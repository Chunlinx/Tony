                                 Being John McLaughlin            Whenpresidential candidates brag about their dialogue with the American peopleas they inevitably do what they really mean of course is their monologue atthe American people They orate you write a check This is not conversationit is a sales pitch The candidates idea of give and take is you give Itake Even the muchvaunted campaign Web sites allow visitors no moreengagement than sending an email off into the inky void            But itis an Internet axiom that there are no oneway streets For Netizens anational conversation requires actual discussion There are plenty of Websites that will feed you political informationsee Jack Shafers  for thebestbut where can you go on the Net to debate bicker blab argue sparkvetch or just plain gossip about the presidential campaign Where can youplay John McLaughlin to another cybergabbers Jack Germond            Thefirst stop is Usenet where dozens of political newsgroups are gearing up forIowa and New Hampshire Altpoliticselection is the most fertile of thesebulletin boards but other heated campaign confabs can be found ataltpoliticsrepublicans altpoliticsliberal altpolitics altpoliticsusaaltpoliticsmedia uspolitics altcurrenteventsclintonwhitewater andothers If youre not used to Usenet you can access the groups at Dejacom            Newsgroupies arent yet fixated on  so to find campaign chat youll haveto bypass endless threads about Waco the Brooklyn Museum Jesse Ventura andMasonic conspiracies But once you do find it the Usenet campaign talk is atonic At their best the groups spin off both Al Frankenesque quips andhighminded colloquies about campaign platforms On altpolitics for examplea couple of dozen folks spent several days drilling down on Bill Bradleyshealthcare proposal Meanwhile Athanaric capped an altpoliticsrepublicansdebate on George W Bushs alleged cocaine use with an endorsement of apowderhead president Stoners  just sit around hitting the bong watchingCNN and sending Secret Service guys out to bring back some Taco Bell Realcokehead politicians would be running around getting things done You cant sitstill and be lethargic after doing a fat rail Im for Bush here It must beadmitted that there is a lot more quipping than wonking in these debates            Thenewsgroupies are wonderfully vitriolic Many of the discussions are flame warsand almost all are uncivil Conservatives are the clear champions A threadtitled Republicans shoot American children in the back is easily trumped byDemocrats believe in raping their own daughters But the intimacy of thenewsgroups frequently borders on claustrophobia Youll see the same names andthe same harangues over and over if you stay too long in a group And Usenetattracts more than its share of obsessives most are gardenvariety Wacoconspiracists or antiClinton loonies Many threads that begin by analyzing AlGores campaign end by denouncing the Vice Criminal and the FirstRapist            Forless rant and more substance head to the political Webzines                  Slate               sown forum  always has several active campaign threadsusually pegged to
