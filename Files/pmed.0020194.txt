                            Exposure to short periods of very loud noise can cause tinnitusa persistent ringing or        buzzing in the ears that cannot be blocked out Tinnitus may affect around  of the        population severe tinnitus is very debilitating  of the population Previous work        has shown that tinnitus has a neurophysiological basis but precisely which parts of the        brain and the auditory circuits are involved is not yet understood        The human ear is essentially a very sensitive vibration sensor one that is able to        receive the minute longitudinal vibrations in air that make up sound waves It can detect        sounds from  Hertz Hz very low pitch to  Hz very high pitch but is        particularly sensitive to sounds in the range of  Hzthe socalled speech        frequencies However the ear and in particular the cochlea or inner ear can be damaged        by exposure to excess noise leading to permanent damage to the ear ie deafness        Some studies in both animals and humans have suggested that tinnitus and hearing loss        may be related These studies have found that neurons in regions of the auditory cortex        that have been deprived of stimuli because of hearing loss change their receptive field and        may develop enhanced spontaneous activity Other studies such as some involving        neuroimaging using positron emission tomography have suggested that parts of the brain        involved in attention and emotional regulation might be involved in the production of        tinnitus        One of the key research targets in tinnitus has been investigation of cortical activity        especially in animal models of tinnitus but studies in humans have been rare Previous        studies have identified temporal and frontal temporal changes in individuals whose tinnitus        is severely disabling however there have been no group studies comparing abnormalities of        ongoing spontaneous neuronal activity in people with and without tinnitus        In this months         PLoS Medicine  Nathan Weisz and colleagues studied  patients with        chronic tinnitus and hearing loss and  control individuals with normal hearing Patients        were asked to fill in a questionnaire about the impact of tinnitus on their lives and had        their levels of tinnitus assessed        The teams methods differed from previous work in that the team chose to examine the        power spectrum of neuromagnetic oscillatory activity during rest whereas previous studies        had focused on measuring neurophysiological responses following sounds        Normally in awake and healthy subjects a certain rhythm of brain activity at  Hzthe        socalled alpha rhythmis dominant Finding enhanced slowwave or delta activity         Hz in awake subjects is usually a sign of a dysfunctional neuronal network as these waves        can be observed in various neurological and psychiatric disorders Weisz and colleagues        analysis of the frequency spectrum of recorded magnetic fields revealed that the energy in        the alpha band was strongly reduced and that of the delta band enhanced in the group with        tinnitus compared with the individuals with normal hearing This pattern was particularly        pronounced in the temporal regions and overall the effects were stronger for the alpha        than for the delta frequency band        This is the first study to show these changes in delta and alpha spontaneous cortical        activity say the authors But they concede it is still unclear whether the enhancement of        delta activity compared with alpha is the abnormal activity perceived as tinnitus However        the fact that regions that show slowwave activity during slowwave sleep are also regions        of low alpha activity supports the idea that changes in cortical activity might be mediated        by sensory deprivation in this case that partial hearing loss might be involved in        producing tinnitus        Tinnitusrelated distress as assessed by the questionnaire was strongly associated with        this abnormal spontaneous activity especially in the right temporal and left frontal        areas thus pinpointing a possible tinnitusrelated cortical network        A limitation of this study was that the tinnitus group also had highfrequency hearing        loss whereas the control group did not the ideal control group would have been patients        with the same sort of hearing loss but no tinnitus        In discussing their findings the authors suggest that their study supports previous        work indicating that the prefrontal cortex is a candidate region for integration of the        sensory and emotional aspects of tinnitus Further studies should focus on frontal areas        which could allow identification of interactions and modulating influences that        higherorder psychological processes eg emotions and thoughts may have on the        generation of tinnitus in the auditory cortex
