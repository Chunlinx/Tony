                                 After the Revolution            The career of the proteanallmedia artist Aleksandr Rodchenko  can be seen as a textbookexample of the seduction and betrayal of the Russian Revolution No he wasntsent to a gulag and he wasnt shot Rather he lived on to see his idealsthoroughly rubbished and himself marginalized to the point of nonexistence Buthis life and art appear inseparable from the trajectory of the Communistexperiment To view the large multifaceted exhibit of his work at MoMA is atonce exhilarating and poignantexhilarating because of the nearly  years ofunabating discovery astounding energy and constant renewal at its heartpoignant because the main inspiration for the work was a ladderlike series ofdelusions that inevitably toppled Rodchenko into the void            Rodchenkowas the epitome of Constructivism which of all the isms of early th century art was the most concerned with practical matters ofthe workaday world Not all Russian avantgardists were Constructivists andnot all Constructivists were Russian or necessarily Communist From our removethere appear to be many similarities among Rodchenkos preoccupations and thoseof artists who stood on the other side of some ideological gulf KasimirMalevich for example was also concerned with geometry and with purifying artof baggage such as color but his Suprematism had its origin in an asceticspirituality Many of the artists associated with Bauhaus were like Rodchenkoout to remake the world beginning with the appearance of material objects butunlike him they did not feel the burden of responsibility toward a society inprogress            Rodchenko and his friends in the variousgroupings of the left wing of Soviet art in the s saw themselves asembattled representatives of the true spirit of the Revolution in the face ofvarious currents of reaction mediocrity timidity and stasis VladimirMayakovsky was out to reinvent poetry Vsevelod Meyerhold theater VladimirTatlin the monument Dziga Vertov cinema Viktor Shklovsky and Sergei Tretiakovprose literature while Rodchenkos domain comprised advertising illustrationgraphic design stage design photography and a few other things besidesTheirs was a revolution of the imagination and many of their works continue topresent the vigor of that spirit even after threequarters of a century ofpastiches and secondhand derivations but at the same time they present anunhappy example of wishful thinking These artists believed that if they builttheir respective corners of the new world the rest would fill itself in andthe people would flock to inhabit it Instead few of them had much of apopular base all their careers were squelched by Stalin and most of them werekilled            All ofthem were radical Modernists well before  and Rodchenko was no exceptionThe path of his early years is graphically shown on the walls of MoMA as aprocess of relentless stripping down jettisoning first figuration thenambiguity then volume and finally color After his ritual immolation of thelastin  at a show where he exhibited panels of pure red yellow andblue as a farewell gesturehe was finally ready to begin reconstruction fromthe bottom initially by way of collage The family resemblance among hiscollages and those being made concurrently by artists in Germany France andeven the United States provides a bracing example of what is meant by aZeitgeist in a time of shaky and sluggish telecommunications severaldozen widely separated artists all hit at once on the idea of chopping upwhatever printed ephemera lay at hand and reassembling the fragments intodynamic compositions that reassigned their meaning It was a scavengersrevolution that held large promise for a time finding potential in the mostrandom litter making a new world out of the debris of the old            Soon Rodchenko had renounced any art divorcedfrom practical application and was driving down every useful avenue designingclothing the factory uniform by way of Buck Rogers printed fabricsnewspaper kiosks logotypes magazine covers and book jackets and printedadvertisements of all sorts When Lenin instituted the New Economic Policy inwhich permitted a limited amount of capitalist competition in order torestore some of the countrys cash flowRodchenko and Mayakovsky became theadvertising agency for many of the states manufacturing and retail operationswhich in a sense let them have their cake and eat it too Rodchenkosdesignsin red and black crisply diagonal filled with visual hooks andslamsare still being aped today and some of them manage to look more modernthan anything around now Mayakovskys apparently catchy rhymed slogansunfortunately do not translate well            Mayakovskys scowlingangular shavenheaded poetic boxers mug was a dramatic advertising image untoitself and Rodchenkos six portraits of him made him an icon to be recycledendlessly in Soviet propaganda after Mayakovskys dubious  suicide an actwhich even if selfwilled was certainly nudged along by the state Theportraits also launched Rodchenkos photographic career which with typicalflair fell effortlessly into the main currents of European Modernism Despitestrong competition from abroad he virtually came to own the rakish angle onmultistory architecture and he shared with the German Umbo title to theperpendicular view of the street from above The show includes some lesserknown works as well such as his serial shots of Moscow street peddlers whichwith their static figures and shifting traffic backdrops are like little moviescomposed of stills            His photography was thefirst thing that got him in trouble too as his wildly angled closeups of thefaces of the Young Pioneers were denounced as grotesque by members ofconservative art factions Rodchenko who for a couple of years after theRevolution continued to ally himself with the soontobebanned anarchists nowfelt the shifting winds and bent himself to various acts of publicselfcriticism but even so he found himself unable to obtain permits forstreet photography He diligently applied himself to the kind of work allottedin the Stalinist era documenting official marches and construction projects inthe hinterlands His private pictures from the time include some classics butthey are classics of despair In his last  years he was effectivelydead
