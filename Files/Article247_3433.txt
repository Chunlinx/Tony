                                 Worries of the Corporate Elite                                       Received last night  pm                        Russ Im pretty much written out but a couple of things            To say that corporations rather than the government are driving economicpolicy isnt to say that they have absolute power After all even dictatorshave to worry about justifying their policies hence the centrality ofpropaganda to fascist and Communist regimes and cant do everything they wantthere is always the danger of provoking a rebellion Of course in the UnitedStates and other Western countries the corporate elite has to worry aboutpublic sentiment expressed not only in elections but in organized oppositionhowever weak there still is some from the labor movement the environmentalmovement etc It has taken  years since the first big push toward austerityand deregulation in the s to seriously erode the liberal welfare state andthere is still major resistance to the privatization of Social Securitysignificant erosion of Medicare and so on But corporate economic andpolitical pressure has steadily pushed public policy in this directionregardless of whether Republicans or Democrats are in office            The term hate crime doesnt get at what I think is the real issue thatcertain kinds of crimes are not just aimed at a particular victim but are meantto intimidate or send a message to a whole class of people whether to stayout of certain neighborhoods hide their sexuality stop performing abortionsor whatever In other words such crimes are a form of political terrorism Theyare often committed by groupsthe classic example is lynching It seems clearto me that this kind of intimidation should be recognized for what it is andspecifically punished The question is how best to do it The problem with theidea of hate crime aside from the fact that violent crime is inherentlyhateful as you say is that it doesnt distinguish between deliberateterrorism and acts that may be motivated in whole or in part by bigotry butdont have a purposeful agenda behind them Rather I would define the crime asintimidating citizens from exercising their civil rightswhich refers tobehavior rather than thought or emotionand require evidence of intent andpremeditation I would make it a distinct crime that would have to be chargedand proved separately from charges of murder assault etc            Till tomorrowEllen
