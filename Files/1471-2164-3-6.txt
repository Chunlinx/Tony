                    Background        Atrial fibrillation is a chaotic atrial rhythm resulting        from abnormal signal generation and conduction in the        atria The molecular basis for atrial fibrillation remains        unknown It usually occurs in association with structural        or metabolic abnormalities Atrial fibrillation however        does occur in individuals with none of these causes        referred to as lone atrial fibrillation Recently we        identified several families of multiple generations        affected with atrial fibrillation with no other underlying        cause detected This subset of familial atrial fibrillation        provides an opportunity to explore a molecular basis for        atrial fibrillation        Atrial fibrillation segregates as an autosomal dominant        disease characterized by atrial fibrillation on an        electrocardiogram     We diagnosed atrial fibrillation        in five families from Spain in which the arrhythmia was the        primary manifestation and not associated with any gross        cardiac or metabolic abnormality     Genetic linkage        analysis was performed and the locus responsible for atrial        fibrillation in our family was mapped to q between        markers D and DS an area of about  cM            We proceeded with the candidate gene approach and DLG        was on of the genes mapped to the critical region between        the flanking markers     This gene belongs to the MAGUK        Membrane Associated Gyanylate Kinase family of proteins        known to form scaffolds for proteins involved in        intracellular signal transduction     The MAGUK family        of proteins has been extensively studied in recent years        and shown to play a role in the formation of cell        junctions maintenance of cell shape      and        clustering of channel proteins at the cell surface              Given its location in our critical region and its        function it was selected as a candidate for atrial        fibrillation A partial cDNA sequence of DLG GenBank        accession AB of about  K B was available To        determine if there is a mutation responsible for the        disease it is necessary to have the complete cDNA        Furthermore recognizing that the responsible mutation may        be present in one of the intronexon splice junctions it        is also necessary to obtain the corresponding genomic        sequence Thus we cloned and sequenced the cDNA of the        DLG gene and from the complete cDNA sequence determined        the intronexon boundaries of the gene as well as its human        tissue expression profile                    Materials And Methods                  Northern blot analysis          The ESTymb ATCC clone  clone was          confirmed by sequencing a part of exon  and exon           with the  untranslated region of the DLG cDNA It was          used as a probe labeled with the random primer labeling          kit from Gibco with PdCTP and hybridized to an adult          multi tissue RNA blot from Clontech Pre hybridization          and hybridization were performed with Express Hyb          Solution Clontech using the manufacturers protocol          The membrane was washed once with X SSC SDS for           minutes at room temperature and twice in X SSC          SDS for  minutes at  C Membranes were exposed to          Xray film Kodak overnight at  C                          Cloning and sequencing of the cDNA for DLG          Using the RACE technique Clontech Marathon Ready          Heart cDNA as per manufacturers protocol products were          generated using primers designed in the  end of the          described cDNA DLG Nested RACE was performed on the          product and the generated PCR product cloned by using TA          cloning Invitrogen The clones were plated on kanamycin          IPTG plates Colonies were picked and grown in  ml          LBKan broth Subsequent to miniprep using Qiagen          Miniprep Kit QIAgen Valencia CA the clones were          sequenced on the ABI genetic analyzer using the Big          Dye terminator chemistry The Race primers are Primer A           GCATACACTCCATTCTCCAGACTGATGC  primer B nested to          primer A CACTCATGATGAGCTTGTACTCGCTGTA  primer F          GTGTGGTAGAAGTCAGTCTCCTTGGCCA primer E nested to          primer F and GCTGAATGGAGAGGTTCTCCACCTTCTC  We          generated additional  KB of cDNA for this gene for a          total cDNA length of  KB The cDNA generated had an          overlap of  bp with the published DLG cDNA Genbank          Acc AB in the  end of the gene We further          cloned in two pieces with an overlap of  bp the cDNA          covering about  Kb of this gene in the  end from bp           of the cDNA The clones were Clone TF  bp          of  Kb cDNA using primers T           GGTCTCAACTTAAACTCCAGCACCACGA  with the primer F and          clone GA  bp of  Kb cDNA using primer G           GAGAAGGTGGAG AACCTCTCCATTCAGC  with primer A As          mentioned there is an overlap of  bp  bp of           KB cDNA between the two clones We performed          multiple RACE reactions using heart and placental cDNA          until no further extension was made to the cDNA          suggesting we had reached the end of the gene          In addition to RACE we also used PCR based heart          library screening Origene Technologies Cat We          isolated a clone that matched our RACE clone which gave          confirmation to the cDNA sequence generated by the RACE          technique We used Sequencer  program to assemble our          sequences There was considerable overlap between the           bp fragment of the new sequence and that of the published          cDNA of DLG We identified an ORF with a stop codon          preceding it indicating we had obtained the entire coding          region of the gene The complete cDNA sequence has been          submitted to Genbank Accession Number AF                          InSilicon mapping and genomic organisation Of          DLG          The newly generated DLG cDNA sequence  Kb was          subjected to a search for homology to genomic sequences          in Genbank using BLASTN algorithm on Search Launcher          available at Molecular Biology Computational Resources          MBCR server Baylor College of Medicine BCM          wwwmbcrbcmtmcedu Homologous sequences were          identified on BAC  c Acc No AC and BAC          h Acc No AL The Sequencer  program was          employed to assemble genomic sequences from these BACs          and to map the cDNA to these sequences The genomic          sequences for the gene were deposited in GenBank with          Accession Number AF                          Analysis of patient DNA          Using available genomic sequences primers were          designed to analyze the patient DNA Primers were          anchored in introns and PCR products generated from          genomic DNA of patients PCR was performed with  ng          genomic DNA  M each deoxynucleotide triphosphate           M of forward and reverse primers each and  units of          Taq Polymerase life Technologies PCR was done on          PE or PE thermocycler Sequencing reactions were          performed using fluorescent labeled Big Dye terminator          Applied Biosystems Foster City CA on a PE          thermocycler Each reaction was then cleaned over the          Edge Biosystems column and subsequently sequenced on an          ABI or ABI genetic analyzer Sequences were          assembled using Sequencer  program                          Use of a novel technique to rule out deletion          mutations          We utilized a newly available somatic cell hybrid          technique from GMP Genetics Inc    to obtain haploid          cell lines In brief this technology provides a means          whereby the two homologous chromosomes are separated and          isolated into separate cell lines Our affected patients          diploid leucocytic cell line was converted to haploid          somatic cell hybrid lines The hybrid cell lines were          screened to identify those cell lines that contain the          chromosome  homologues We further confirmed by          genotyping that the DNA of one of these haploid lines had          the alleles segregating with the disease Thus if a          mutation in the DLG gene is responsible for the disease          it would be in this cell line We then performed PCR          using primers anchored in the introns of DLG for each of          the exons on both the normal haploid DNA and the disease          bearing haploid DNA The presence of amplification          products from both haploid lines would detect any exon          deletion that may have eluded detection by PCR from          genomic DNA                            Results and discussion                  Human tissue expression patterns of DLG          The expression pattern of the DLG gene was analyzed          in multiple adult human tissues by Northern Blot Analysis          using as a probe the ATCC clone  EST ymb          with insert an size of  Kb which contains exon           and  with  untranslated region of the gene A          twentyfour hour exposure showed abundant expression in          placenta with minimal expression in skeletal muscle          liver kidney and pancreas and no expression in heart          data not shown Exposure for six days showed expression          in heart no expression in the brain and abundant          expression in placenta as shown in Figure  We observed          a single transcript of approximately  Kb thus the          published sequence of the cDNA for the DLG gene was          incomplete                          Cloning and sequencing of the DLG cDNA          On Northern Blot Analysis a single transcript of          approximately  Kb was observed Using Race Technique          on Heart cDNA and heart library screening as described          above we characterized the entire cDNA of  Kb a          UTR from bp  to  ORF from bp  and UTR from          bp  The translation start codon of the cDNA is          at bp  in exon  and the stop codon is at bp  in          exon  As multiple clones were sequenced after RACE           distinct forms were observed one with a  nucleotide          deletion in the beginning of exon  and the form without          the deletion The deletion did not result in any change          in the ORF of the gene                          Search for ESTS homologous to the cDNA          Using Search Launcher available on the Molecular          Biology Computational Resources MBCR server at Baylor          College of Medicine BCM wwwmbcrbcmtmceduhomology          searches on the new cDNA sequence against DBEST database          identified several ESTs Acc BF and Acc          bf which overlap each other and match the new          cDNA                          Determining the intron exon boundaries of          DLG          We mapped  exons  of the  Kb of the cDNA          to a genomic region spanning about  Kb We could not          map  bp UTR on to the genomic region This may be          because none of these BACs are completely sequenced in          Genbank and there are still gaps in the genomic          sequencing Attempts at direct BAC walking to place these          nucleotides were unsuccessful perhaps because these          regions of genomic DNA are difficult to sequence due to          its secondary structure The details of the genomic          organization of the gene are shown in Table and Figure           All but two of the resulting intronexon boundaries          concur with the typical splice donor and acceptor          motifGTAG The sequences around each splice site are          shown in Table                           Determining the functional domains in DLG          The MAGUK family of proteins     have          characteristic domains which are present in DLG PDZ at          bp  PDZ  domain  bp SH domain bp           and the GUK domain at bp  Figure                    Several domains were identified in the novel cDNA          using MOTIF at SEQ WEB A single repeat unit of the          Regulator of Chromosomal Chromatin RCC domain was          detected starting at bp  RCC is a eukaryotic          protein that has seven tandem repeats units which          comprise a domain of  amino acids This domain binds          to chromatin and interacts with Ran a nuclear          GTPbinding protein that stimulates a guanine nucleotide          dissociation Thus RCC probably plays a role as a gene          regulator Only one repeat unit is present in DLG which          makes it difficult to predict whether it also has such          gene regulating function          A prenyl groupbinding site CAAX box was also          detected starting at  bp A number of proteins are          post translationally modified by the attachment of either          a fresnyl or a geranylgeranyl group to a cysteine          residue This modification occurs on a cysteine residue          three residues proximal to the Cterminus with two          aliphatic amino acids separating the cysteine from the          Cterminus hence the term CAAX box Certain proteins          such as Ras proteins and the Raslike protein Rho          nuclear lamins A and B and some G protein alpha subunits          have this modification These proteins are involved in          intracellular signal transduction This is another          mechanism by which DLG may be involved in intracellular          signal transduction In addition to these domains there          are two leucine zippers starting at base pairs  and           suggesting proteinprotein interaction                          Exclusion of DLG as a candidate for familial          atrial fibrillation in our family          The exons and flanking intronic sequences of DLG          were amplified by PCR and sequenced in four members of          the family two affected and two normals There were no          missense or nonsense mutations segregating with the          disease in either the coding regions or splice junctions          of this gene To exclude a large deletion that might have          eluded amplification from diploid DNA by PCR sequencing          was performed on the haploid cell lines and no mutation          was identified Thus DLG is excluded as a possible          cause of familial atrial fibrillation in these          families          Utilizing the available partial cDNA sequence we          confirmed the localization of DLG to the locus for          atrial fibrillation at q and subsequently cloned and          sequenced the DLG gene which spanned  KB The          available  KB cDNA sequence was extended by RACE and          confirmed on northern analysis to be about  KB The          genomic structure of the DLG was determined to consist          of  exons and shown to have ubiquitous human tissue          expression including placenta heart skeletal muscle          liver and pancreas with placenta being the tissue of          strongest expression Exclusion of a deletion from the          haploid cell lines confirmed the absence of any mutation          and thus DLG was excluded as a cause for the atrial          fibrillation in these families Two distinct transcripts          of DLG were observed differing by only  bp which          would predict the addition or deletion of  amino          acids but would not alter the translation frame of the          gene          The DLG gene encodes for a protein that is a member          of the MAGUK Membrane Associated Guan late Kinase          homologs family of proteins located in the plasma          membrane     MAGUK is a new family of proteins that          act as a molecular scaffold for intracellular signaling          pathways     The MAGUK family of proteins is          characterized by domains that interact with other          proteins to create an assembly of large multiprotein          complexes     The PDZ PSD DLG and ZO domains          are the best characterized for their binding to the          Cterminal region of channels and transmembrane proteins              Usually each protein has  copies of such          domains       The SH domain Src homology  are          present in proteins that couple transmembrane receptors          to signaling molecules     The presence of this          domain in MAGUKs increases their possibilities of          interacting with signaling pathways The GUK domain shows          a high degree of similarity to guanylate kinase enzyme          which converts GMP to GDP using ATP as a phosphate donor          The dlglike MAGUKs do not have kinase activity              Furthermore this domain has been shown to interact with          other proteins       MAGUKs function by binding          to the transmembrane proteins at the cytoplasmic side and          to other signal transduction proteins and thus appear to          provide the platform for efficient and specific signal          interactions between the different components of the          signaling pathway Acting as scaffold proteins these          proteins play a pivotal role in creating an efficient          signaling pathway by localizing the signaling molecules          at regions of cell surface preferentially exposed to the          ligand and by spatially restricting the molecules to          provide specific downstream responses          The DLG gene encodes for  PDZ domains with another          region in the Nterminus having very weak homology to an          additional two PDZ domains It is notable that the PDZ          domains predicted for the DLG protein do not have the          GLGF motif     present in most members of the MAGUK          family This motif helps in the binding of the MAGUK with          the Cterminus of proteins that have the consensus E          ST  Vl motif     However the studies on the          Drosophila protein InaD which also has a PDZ domain          show that are other targets for the PDZ domain that do          not have the consensus Cterminus binding motif              Thus in DLG the PDZ domain may be binding to other          targets that do not require the classic GLGF motif for          interaction Like other members of this family DLG also          has one SH and GUK domain In addition it has two          leucine zippers and an RCC domain that represents other          potential proteinprotein interactions          Previously reported MAGUKs have been studied for these          interactions and elegant work has shown one of its          members p to form a ternary complex that links the          cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane to maintain proper          cell shape     Also there is significant evidence          that MAGUKs are active in protein clustering especially          of ion channels and membrane bound receptors     This          interaction has been proven by experiments in which DLG          mutants show loss of clustering of the Shaker channels at          neuromuscular junction     Mammalian PSD is a          MAGUK which binds Kir an inwardly rectifying K          channel expressed in glial cells and also clusters it to          cell membranes in vitro     Thus MAGUKs may regulate          the distribution and also the function of transmembrane          receptors and channels                            Conclusions        Given these observations its pattern of expression in        the human adult heart we considered it to be an excellent        candidate for the familial atrial fibrillation and        evaluated it in our family by sequencing We have ruled out        functional mutation in the coding region and splice        junction as well as any exon deletion as possible cause of        the disease in this family This gene remains an        interesting candidate for other inherited cardiac        diseases
