                    Background        Asthma is one of the most serious allergic diseases        Characteristic features of atopic asthma are circulating        specific IgE antibodies positive skin tests to common        allergens and infiltration of the bronchial mucosa with        eosinophils and Th cells The resulting pulmonary        inflammation leads to bronchoconstriction airway        hyperresponsiveness and ultimately to airway remodeling          Many cellular mediators including cytokines and        chemokines are involved in asthma Thtype cytokines such        as interleukin IL IL IL and IL may        contribute to pathophysiological changes in asthma          The complexity of asthma originates from the interaction of        an unknown number of genes with environmental factors          Studies of twins have shown that concordance rates for        asthma are significantly higher in monozygotic twins than        in dizygotic twins and that the heritability of asthma may        be as high as    Linkage analysis of asthma within        families has revealed that there are multiple chromosomal        regions containing potential candidate genes associated        with various asthma phenotypes            Microarray technology offers a new opportunity to gain        insight into global geneexpression profiles in asthma        leading to the identification of asthmaassociated genes        Microarrays are a genechipbased technology in which        cDNA sequences representing individual genes are spotted on        glass slides at high density   These sequences are then        hybridized to cDNA probes derived from paired RNA samples        of interest The two sets of cDNA probes can be labeled        with two different fluorescent dyes The competitive        hybridization of a fluorescently labeled probe pair to a        microarray enables a comparison of the relative abundance        of transcripts of that gene in each sample In this way        microarrays can detect the differential expression levels        of thousands of genes simultaneously        Cluster analysis is often applied to the analysis of        microarray data In this method statistical algorithms are        used to arrange genes according to similarity in their        pattern of expression   The combination of microarray        data and cluster analysis to make a genetic portrait of a        disease has been used to characterize breast tumors          to categorize the subtype of diffuse large Bcell lymphoma          and to identify genes whose expression is associated        with mitotic misregulation and human aging          The allergic cynomolgus monkey          Macaca fascicularis  has been used        as a nonhuman primate model to study inflammatory        responses in the lung following allergen challenge           This monkey has a natural hypersensitivity to the        antigen of the nematode         Ascaris suum Inhalation of the         A suum extract causes IgEmediated        immediate and delayed allergic reactions and an influx of        inflammatory cells into the lung   The resulting lung        airway inflammation eosinophilia and hypersensitive        bronchoconstriction have similarities to the symptoms and        processes seen in human asthma   Therefore examination        of the geneexpression profile in this nonhuman primate        model could provide useful insights into genes regulated in        asthma and the mediators produced        In the study reported here we investigated the        differential geneexpression profile in the acute phase of        allergic reaction to the         Ascaris antigen in monkey lungs As        the cytokine IL is an important inflammatory mediator in        asthma   an ILchallenged monkey lung was also        included in this study                    Results and discussion                  Experimental design          DNA microarrays were used to identify the gene          expression pattern induced in the lung of allergic          monkeys by inhalation of           A suum extract Six control          animals and four experimental animals were used for          microarray hybridization experiments Because of initial          limitations on the availability of allergic monkeys a          strategy was used whereby microarray studies were          conducted using a single animal at each of three          different time points   and  h after challenge by          inhalation of           A suum extract The selection of          time points is based on our previous study of           Ascaris challenged monkeys            Following the identification of regulated genes a second          method  quantitative reverse transcription polymerase          chain reaction RTPCR using Taqman  was used to          establish that selected regulated genes detected by          microarray could be confirmed in the same sample by          RTPCR to compare the magnitude of regulation determined          by microarray and RTPCR and to verify the validity of          selected regulated genes by examining the gene expression          levels in lung RNA from multiple individual control and          challenged monkeys Lastly because IL is implicated as          an important inflammatory mediator in asthma   one          monkey was treated with recombinant human IL by          inhalation and lung RNA isolated  h later In summary          a total of four experimental monkey lung tissue samples          were used for microarray hybridization  and  h          after allergen challenge or  h after IL challenge          The geneexpression levels in each of these samples were          compared to those of an RNA pool prepared from equivalent          amounts of lung RNA from each of six normal control          monkeys          Approximately  cDNA elements on the microarrays          were hybridized with the four probe pairs to examine          differential gene expression Genes were chosen for          further study by being up or downregulated by at least          fold compared to controls in at least one of the four          probe pairs The selection of these genes was empirical          The use of a higher criterion that is threefold          excluded some genes such as those for MCP and ICAM          which are known to be regulated in the acute phase of          allergen challenge    on the other hand a lower          criterion such as twofold increased the probability of          falsepositive genes and lack of confirmation by RTPCR          see Validation of the microarray gene expression          below          In total  cDNA elements were identified to be          regulated by more than fold in at least one of the          pairwise probe comparisons This is  of the           cDNA elements on the microarray Factors contributing to          this low frequency of regulated genes may include the          criterion used for selection fold of the normal          control level induction of only a limited set of genes          by this allergen as its inhalation causes an acute          inflammation response mainly in airways and the use of          probes from wholelung homogenates which may result in a          dilution of signals making it difficult to detect genes          induced only in the airways Therefore the actual number          of genes induced by the allergen may be higher In          comparison a largescale geneexpression study of a          complex tissue  breast tumors  demonstrated that  of          the total genes examined were regulated by at least          fourfold in at least three of the  probe pairs tested                     Lastly the interspecies hybridization using monkey          cDNA to probe human cDNA arrays could also contribute to          the low number of regulated genes identified The          sequence homology between monkey and human genes is quite          high however For example our analysis of all available          cDNA sequences of cynomolgus monkey for  known genes          shows that the average percentage identity between monkey          and human cDNA is about  ranging from  to  Only          five sequences  have identity less than  A          study of the sensitivity and specificity of          oligonucleotide mer microarray demonstrated that          sequences with greater than  identity will          crosshybridize and contribute to the overall signal          intensity   When we use RTPCR to validate          microarray results most of the primers and probes in          RTPCR are designed on the basis of human sequences          which in fact works well on monkey cDNAs Therefore most          of genes on the human cDNA array should have been          detected by monkey cDNA probes in this study          A total of  genes were represented by the  cDNA          elements identified as regulated in this study Of the           genes  were novel and  were known genes Table          provides a summary of the numbers of differentially          expressed cDNA elements in each of the four probe pairs          At  h after challenge the highest number of          downregulated cDNA elements  was observed while the          highest number of upregulated cDNA elements  was seen          in the ILchallenged monkey The largest number of          differentially expressed cDNA elements  was seen  h          after the allergen challenge with fewer observed at  h           cDNA elements or  h after challenge  cDNA          elements Interestingly the second highest number of          regulated genes  occurred in the ILchallenged          monkey at  h While definitive conclusions are          precluded by the fact that each time point or condition          is represented by only a single probe pair it is          noteworthy that the highest number of regulated genes was          observed early  h after challenge                          Cluster analysis of microarray data          A statistical cluster program was used to analyze the           cDNA elements identified as regulated by more than          fold in one or more probe pairs Of the  cDNA          elements  met with the minimal requirements of the          cluster program see Materials and methods and were          subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis This          methodology   has been used by others to define the          geneexpression profile of breast tumors   to subtype          diffuse large Bcell lymphomas   and to identify          genes whose expression is associated with mitotic          misregulation and human aging   Figure aillustrates          the clusteranalysis results All the genes with a          similar spatial and temporal expression pattern were          clustered together on the basis of their similarity          scores To visualize the temporal expression pattern of          the clusters the geneexpression levels are displayed          for a majority of genes with known functions Figure          b          One of the clusters that displayed the largest number          of the upregulated genes is cluster A The genes in this          cluster demonstrated a similar temporal geneexpression          pattern Figure b Four hours after allergen challenge          genes in this cluster were increased by two to fourfold          of the level observed in normal controls The elevated          gene expression observed at  h after challenge was          decreased by  h postchallenge and was generally near          baseline levels  h after the challenge Most of the          genes in this cluster were also upregulated by IL          Cluster A is dominated by genes for chemokines and          adhesion molecules which are known to be involved in          inflammatory responses          More specifically MCP    MCP             eotaxin    pulmonary and activationrelated          chemokine PARC   and vascular cell adhesion          molecule  VCAM   have been identified as          mediators of pulmonary inflammation in asthma or relevant          animal models Many of the genes in cluster A derived          from the ILtreated monkey were generally increased          above the control level Importantly several of these          genes  those for eotaxin   VCAM   MCP            and MCP    were previously known to be          inducible by IL in cells relevant to pulmonary          inflammation and this regulation is corroborated here           in vivo in the pulmonary tissue of          a nonhuman primate          Other genes in cluster A are involved in tissue          remodeling those encoding tissue inhibitor of          metalloproteinase TIMP   plasminogen activator          inhibitor PAI   and chitinase    or in          wound healing tumorassociated antigen L          Interestingly in another microarray study using the          Incyte UniGEMV chip   PAI was identified as a          highly expressed inducible gene in human mast cells This          gene is known to be involved in a pathway that controls          fibrosis and regulates the extracellular matrix during          tissue remodeling Studies of PAIdeficient or          overexpressing mice indicate that PAI regulates the          amount of collagen deposition in the lung   Another          cluster A gene is alpha            antichymotrypsin ACT a member of          the serine proteinase inhibitor serpin family which          inhibits the neutrophil proteinase cathepsin G and mast          cell chymases and protects the lower respiratory tract          from damage by proteolytic enzymes   A recent          linkage study of an Italian population of allergic          asthmatics suggests that ACT or a gene in close proximity          on chromosome  is an asthmasusceptibility gene in this          population   Lastly several antioxidant genes were          also identified Mn superoxide dismutase SOD          SOD glutathione peroxidase GPx There is evidence          that oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species          contribute to the inflammation of asthma            The gene expression pattern of cluster B resembled          that of cluster A One of the main differences between          cluster A and cluster B is that most of genes in cluster          B were minimally regulated by IL As for cluster A the          expression of the genes in cluster B was also two to          fourfold higher at  h after challenge compared to          control However the elevated gene expression was at          baseline levels  h after challenge Due to the low          number of known genes identified by these microarray          studies  and the few genes contained within the          clusters such as cluster B specifying the biochemical          pathways defined by each cluster is difficult however          several genes of note are included in this cluster In          contrast to the three antioxidant genes in cluster A          which are inducible by IL the gene for glutathione           S transferase GST a member of          cluster B is not regulated by IL Additional genes          involved in remodeling are contained within cluster B          such as those for MMP also known as matrilysin            thrombospondin   and haptoglobinalpha          Haptoglobinalpha is highly expressed in alveolar          macrophages and eosinophils in inflamed human lung          tissues   Lastly the intercellular adhesion          molecule ICAM a cluster B gene was previously found          to be increased on inflamed airway epithelium in a          primate model of pulmonary inflammation            It should be noted that genes for cytokines such as          IL IL IL and IL which are known to be          involved in allergic pulmonary inflammation   and          would be expected to be observed in cluster A or B were          not identified because their cDNA sequences were not          present on the microarrays used          In contrast to clusters A and B the genes in cluster          D were downregulated in response to the allergen          challenge Figure b The level of expression of genes          in this cluster was decreased between fold and          fold  h after challenge compared to the control pool          with minimal changes observed  h after challenge The          largest changes in geneexpression levels were observed          in this cluster the genes for CCAATbinding          transcription factorB NFYB fold SYBL fold          and aminopeptidase A fold IL treatment had a          minimal effect on the genes in this cluster They do not          clearly define any one cellular pathway but rather          multiple processes One gene in particular is interesting           SLAM signaling lymphocytic activation molecule           In vitro studies in polarized human          Th and Th CD Tcell subsets indicate that higher          levels of SLAM are observed in Th cells   The          downregulation of SLAM gene expression observed here          after allergen challenge which induces a Th response          is consistent with this earlier observation In addition          levels of soluble SLAM in serum were found to be lower in          patients with elevated IgE than in normal controls and          low production of SLAM was associated with a Th response                    in vivo            Clusters C and E are composed of genes that are          regulated  h after IL inhalation but not          significantly regulated by the antigen challenge even at          a similar time point The clusters differ in that the          genes in cluster C were upregulated and genes in cluster          E were downregulated by IL Three genes are noteworthy          The genes for complement C and IP IFNinduced          protein of  kDa a nonELR CXC chemokine were among          the genes upregulated by IL in the monkey lung In          support of the microarray findings IL is known to          increase           C mRNA levels and subsequent          protein production in A cells a pulmonary epithelial          cell line   In addition           IP mRNA which is induced in a          variety of cell types by interferon IFN is          augmented by IL in bone marrow stromal cells   and          keratinocytes   but not in respiratory epithelial          primary cells or cell lines   The upregulation of           IP mRNA observed here in monkeys          challenged by IL inhalation warrants further          investigation to determine the cell type and mechanism of          IL regulation of           IP in vivo Lastly the          cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p was upregulated by          IL in the monkey lung The p protein is a negative          regulator of cytokinestimulated Tcell growth   as          revealed in pdeficient mice The upregulation of           p mRNA by IL identified by          microarray studies suggests that           p is an ILinducible gene          Further studies of ILmediated regulation of this and          other genes in cluster A such as those for PAI and          TIMP and in cluster E such as angiotensin          Iconverting enzyme ACE tyrosine kinase receptor          TEK and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor LIFR          are warranted on the basis of the microarray results          presented here                          Validation of microarray geneexpression          data          The quality of the microarray data was estimated by          examining a small subset of the cDNA elements that was          present in duplicate or triplicate on the microarrays          Each of these replicate cDNA elements on the microarray          encodes a different region of the same gene Therefore          where possible the similarity of the expression levels          of the replicate cDNA elements representing a given gene          was examined For example among  genes encoded by the           cDNA elements nine genes were represented by two          cDNA elements and two genes by three cDNA elements For          seven of these eleven genes their multiple cDNA elements          were located on the different microarrays in the total          set of six microarrays used Impressively the microarray          readings between these duplicate or triplicate cDNA          elements were similar to each other such that the          standard deviations were in general less than  of the          mean expression value for the   h and          ILchallenged groups Furthermore all the replicate          cDNA elements that encoded the same gene were grouped          into the same cluster and were generally in the adjacent          rows in the cluster data not shown indicating that the          replicate cDNAs on microarray produce very similar          hybridization results          Verification of differential gene expression in the          lungs of challenged monkeys was examined on a small set          of known genes First the accuracy of microarray          technology was tested using quantitative realtime RTPCR          Taqman The geneexpression levels obtained by RTPCR          were normalized to that of gene for the enzyme          hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyl transferase HPRT          and expressed as the fold increase or decrease relative          to that of the normal control pool Twenty known genes          were chosen from among the five clusters for this          analysis the majority were selected from cluster A          which contained the largest number of the most highly          upregulated genes Microarray geneexpression levels were          compared to those obtained by RTPCR using the same          monkey lung samples used in the microarray hybridization          Figure displays the results of  of  genes tested for          confirmation and these are among the  genes that were          significantly regulated            p   when subsequently          tested by RTPCR on multiple hchallenged monkeys see          below The pattern of gene expression up or          downregulation was similar for the genes when the two          methods of measurement were compared The differences          between these two methods become prominent at lower          levels of expression Importantly the direction and          degree of differential expression of  of  genes          initially identified by microarray were confirmed by          quantitative RTPCR Figure  Table           Table summarizes the ratio of expression levels          derived from the two methods for  genes listed in          Table  Among  pairs of results compared  of data          pairs are almost identical ratio of microarray to          RTPCR or           vice versa is fold          expression relative to normal control In the remaining           of the data pairs which differed by fold or more          between the two methods  of the paired comparisons          were higher by RTPCR than by microarray whereas only           were higher by microarray than by quantitative PCR          This suggests a smaller dynamic range for microarray          technology compared to that of RTPCR          For the second level of validation we sought to          establish that genes identified by microarray technology          represented genes truly regulated by inhalation antigen          challenge This was done by determining that the          regulated expression levels identified by microarray          technology from a single animal could be confirmed by          RTPCR using multiple similarly treated animals The          timepoint chosen for these studies was  h after          challenge the timepoint representing the largest number          of regulated genes Table  Twenty genes were tested by          quantitative RTPCR in each of four challenged animals          each was  h after challenge of which one was the          original monkey as well as in the six individual normal          unchallenged monkey lungs which previously constituted          the normal control pool Representative genes are shown          in Figure and all  genes are summarized in Table           Ten of the  genes showed significant differences            p   between the challenged          and normal control lungs Table   of these  genes          were initially identified by microarray as being          expressed  fold above control Thus the genes most          highly induced in multiple monkeys  h after allergen          challenge were those for MCP fold MCP          fold eotaxin fold thrombospondin fold          PAI fold and alpha            antichymotrypsin fold The          remaining two significantly regulated genes for orphan          nuclear hormone receptor BD and pepsinogen C were          initially identified as downregulated by greater than          fourfold For the ten other genes that did not show a          significant difference between normal and challenged          monkeys highly concordant results for most of them were          observed between the original microarray foldexpression          level and that obtained by RTPCR in multiple challenged          monkeys It is noteworthy that among the genes analyzed          that were not found to be significantly regulated when          tested in multiple monkeys  h after antigen challenge          there were two genes from cluster E for fibronectin and          calcitonin generelated peptide receptor CGRPR It          is perhaps not surprising that these genes were not found          to be significantly regulated when tested in multiple h          antigenchallenged monkeys as the expression signal          driving the grouping of genes in cluster E originated          from IL as opposed to antigen challenge          In summary the validation tests though limited in          scope indicate that differential expression by          microarray is highly predictive   confirmation          of differential expression determined by RTPCR This          suggests a strategy whereby with the use of a          confirmatory RTPCR step even in the absence of          replicate initial tissues and microarrays microarray          experiments can be used as a highthroughput screen to          identify genes regulated in a complex           in vivo disease model          It is important to note however that no animal          disease model is identical to human disease Although          there have been many efforts to develop animal models          that approximate human asthma or allergy each of the          models has its own advantages and limitations In this          study the cynomolgus monkey which has a naturally          occurring respiratory hypersensitivity to           A suum extract was used          Inhalation of the antigen results in an IgEmediated          bronchoconstriction and inflammatory response in monkey          lung characterized by an influx of eosinophils            This model was used to investigate the mechanisms          underlying the acute inflammatory response and          hypersensitivity reaction in monkey airways Thus the          geneexpression profile in this nonhuman primate model          could provide useful insights into genes regulated in          asthma and the mediators produced although there is no          evidence that the antigen used in this study would          produce the same allergic reaction in humans The          geneexpression profiles of monkey lung are also limited          to the airway responses within  h after antigen          challenge which may not be relevant to the asthmatic          lung or reflect the chronic aspect of asthma          Nevertheless this is the first attempt to produce an          allergeninduced geneexpression profile in the lung of a          nonhuman primate using genomic tools such as microarray          and RTPCR                            Conclusion        This study provides a novel largescale profile of gene        expression in the lung in allergeninduced pulmonary        inflammation in nonhuman primates Not only are many novel        genes differentially expressed in this disease model        identified by microarray but also many known genes which        include many previously observed as regulated in asthma        for example those for eotaxin and VCAM or regulated by        relevant stimuli such as IL in cellular systems for        example VCAM C The results show that microarray        analysis in combination with quantitative realtime PCR is        a powerful tool for identifying mediators of allergic        asthmatic disease through a genomicbased strategy using        nonhuman primates                    Materials and methods                  Normal control animals          The animals were lightly anesthetized with  mgkg

procedure was repeated on the          left side of the lung and the monkey was allowed to          recover from anesthesia After  h the monkey was          reanesthetized with intramuscular ketamine and          euthanized with an overdose of intravenous pentobarbital          Lung tissue was collected and frozen as described          above                          Pulmonary antigen challenge of monkeys with A          suumextract          The monkeys were anesthetized with ketamine and          propofol as before The trachea was intubated and the          animals ventilated with  oxygen Respiratory airflow          and transpulmonary pressure were measured and pulmonary          resistance and compliance were calculated online Model           Buxco Electronics Sharon CT from the

at Incyte          Fremont CA using their proprietary technology          Briefly total RNA was isolated from lung tissue by          standard guanidinium isothiocyanatecesium chloride          gradients   For each probe pair polyA mRNA was          isolated from approximately  g of total RNA using          oligotex beads Qiagen Chatsworth CA Labeled cDNA was          prepared by reverse transcription with fluorescent dyes          Cy for probe  normal controls and Cy for probe           treated animals The labeled probe pairs were used for          microarray hybridization to Gene Album Arrays           containing more than  human cDNA elements Incyte          Genomics Palo Alto CA as described   and Incyte          unpublished data The specifically bound probes on the          microarray were scanned for the two individual          fluorescent colors and the signals were corrected for the          differences between the Cy and Cy channels each probe           Cy signal value was multiplied by a balance          coefficient in order to normalize the geneexpression          data relative to probe  Cy The coefficient equals          the sum of probe  signals divided by the sum of probe           signals for the entire microarray chip The ratio of the          two normalized probe signals provided a quantitative          measurement of the relative geneexpression level for the          challenged lungs compared to the normal controls                          Cluster analysis          Cluster analysis was carried out on the          geneexpression data from microarray experiments An          average linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm was          used to group cDNAs according to the similarity of their          expression patterns These computations were carried out          using the SPLUS software package Mathsoft Seattle          WA Valid microarray signals had a ratio of signal to          background   Genes were selected for cluster          analysis on the following criteria the signal intensity          was at least  units above the background among all          probe pairs for any given gene at least one pair had the          probe  versus probe  ratio larger than fold and no          more than one missing value among all probe pairs was          allowed for a given gene The expression levels of those          known genes in individual cluster are also displayed in          Figure b The logfold expression values are plotted on          these graphs However the           y axis represents the

quantitative detection of the target mRNAs were designed          using Primer Express PE Biosystems Foster City CA          Table summarizes all the Taqman primers and probe          information and sequences Three of the  sets of          primers and probes were designed from monkey cDNA          sequences that were available from GenBank The remaining          genespecific primers and probes were designed using          conserved regions of human ortholog cDNA sequences based          on the alignment of cDNA sequences from several species          Total RNA was isolated from monkey lungs with a Qiagen          RNADNA kit Qiagen Valencia CA followed by DNase          treatment Ambion CA to remove genomic DNA          contamination The RNA was then used for the firststrand          cDNA synthesis Two micrograms of total RNA were primed          with oligodT            and oligodN            and were reverse transcribed into          cDNA Superscript II GibcoBRL in a total volume of           l Aliquots of cDNA target template were diluted          serially and mixed with  nM of primers and  nM of          fluorogenic probe PerkinElmer Foster City CA The          reactions were carried out in the Universal PCR master          mix containing MgCl             dNTP and DNA polymerase AmpliTaq          Gold PerkinElmer in a total volume of  l The PCR          reactions were in duplicate on an ABI PRISM  Sequence          detection system Taqman The reaction program was as          follows the initial step of  min at C denaturation          at C for  min followed by  thermal cycles of          denaturation  sec at C and elongation  min at          C The relative quantitation of the target mRNAs was          carried out using the comparative method according to            The mRNA expression levels for all samples were          normalized to the levels for the housekeeping gene           HPRT                           Statistical analysis          Oneway analyses of variance were carried out on the          expression data obtained from quantitative RTPCR The          results for each gene were analyzed separately using          lognormalized expression level as the dependent          variable and the challenge status of the monkeys as the          group variable
