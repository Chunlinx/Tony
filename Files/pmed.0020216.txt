                            HIVAIDS has reached alarming proportions in Southeast Asia  The magnitude of the        epidemic is projected to exceed that of subSaharan Africa in the st century  More        than  million South Asians are currently infected with HIV  nearly  million of whom        are in India         Nepal has had a comparatively lower prevalence of HIVAIDS compared to other countries        in Southeast Asia Seasonal migration and sexual trafficking across a porous Indian border         fuelled by a bloody Maoist conflict see Sidebar has raised Nepals HIV prevalence        to the second highest in the region after India        In this essay we characterize the current HIV epidemic in Nepal look at the ways in        which the conflict may be fuelling the infection rate and discuss the current local and        international response from the health and development community We argue that there is        currently a short window of opportunity to take action to control the HIV epidemic in        Nepaland that inaction will lead to HIV becoming the biggest killer of the young and        middleaged in the next decade                    The Current HIV Epidemic in Nepal        The first case of AIDS was reported in Nepal in   Most cases of HIV infection in        Nepal are HIV although HIV was also recently reported  As of February  the        National Center for AIDS and STD Control in Nepal reported that there were         HIVpositive people and  confirmed cases of AIDS in Nepal  However because of the        poor surveillance systems and the lack of access to quality voluntary counselling and        testing services coupled with antiretroviral treatment these prevalence figures are likely        to be a gross underestimate         A dramatically higher estimate comes from UNAIDS which estimated that  out of a        population of  million in Nepal were living with HIVAIDS in   One in          people aged  years are living with HIVAIDS in Nepal  About  of those        infected are female  WHOUNAIDS estimates that  children are living with HIV and        that nearly  children were orphaned in Nepal due to AIDS at the end of   The        prevalence in the general population may still be low but it masks an increasing        prevalence in several risk groupsthe prevalence of HIVAIDS consistently exceeds  in        injecting drug users commercial sex workers and migrant workers                     HighRisk Groups        Among injecting drug usersestimated to be about  in Nepalabout  are        HIVpositive  Needle sharing and risky sexual behaviour is common in this group The        figures are particularly alarming in Kathmandu the capital city where nearly  of        injecting drug users are HIVpositive  A subtype C virus with restricted genetic        diversity is thought to have caused this epidemic in Kathmandu  Concomitant hepatitis        C infection is a contributing factor to the rapidity and severity of disease progression in        injecting drug users and  of users in Kathmandu have tested positive for hepatitis C                The predominant mode of transmission of HIV in Nepal is heterosexual contact with        commercial sex workers HIV prevalence rates are about  among sex workers in the Terai        regions of Nepal and about  in their clients which is more than five times the        national average prevalence  In Kathmandu nearly  of sex workers are HIVpositive         There are about  sex workers in Kathmandu  and an estimated  Nepalese        women working in Indian brothels About  to  Nepalese sex workers are trafficked        every year  numbers that are likely to increase as a result of the conflict One        striking estimate is that nearly  of sex workers returning from India are HIVpositive                As in India a major contributor to the spread of HIV in Nepal has been Nepals mobile        population including truckers and migrant workers About half of the estimated cases of        HIV are in  highway districts of Nepal  A  survey indicated that  of the        truckers surveyed had had sex with a sex worker and that only  of the truckers had used        a condom during their last sexual encounter         Men who have sex with men still account for only a small proportion of those affected        with HIV in Nepal But the recent detention and subsequent release of  male transvestite        members of the Blue Diamond Society a local organization that provides sexual health        HIVAIDS and advocacy services to sexual minorities highlights the challenges faced by        sexual minorities in Nepal                     The Role of Conflict in Fuelling the Epidemic        Several factors contribute to the propagation of HIV in times of conflict Box          While accurate numbers are hard to come by the recent conflict may have contributed to the        propagation of HIVAIDS by fuelling displacement  As the insurgency drags on seasonal        and longterm migration of labourers to neighbouring countries such as India is becoming        critical to the economic survival of many households Young men have left the country en        masse for fear of execution and migrated to the highprevalence areas in India UNAIDS        estimates at least  of the  million to  million Nepalese migrant workers in India are        HIVpositive  These men are now infecting spouses and others in many parts of the        country By pushing rural residents from wartorn areas to the capital Kathmandu the        conflict may have helped spread HIVAIDS        Some  to  people may have been displaced in Nepal since the beginning of        the conflict  Migrations within the country and internationally coupled with a        general lack of awareness and knowledge about risk factors is likely to have contributed        to the propagation of the epidemic The far western regions of the country which are less        economically developed and which are the hotbed of the current insurgency are more prone        to migration These regions have one of the fastest growth rates of HIV in South Asia        Migrants are more likely to practice highrisk sexual behaviour  About  of        migrant male workers returning from Mumbai and examined in western Nepal were infected with        HIV  The epidemiological impact on women in migrant communities has yet to be        realized as only  of  women in the Kailali district in western Nepal were        HIVpositive although more than  had some form of STD         Sex traffickers have shifted their trade from Sindhupalchowk and Nuwakot in central        Nepal to Rukum and Rolpa the hotbeds of the insurgency in the midwest taking undue        advantage of the socioeconomic conditions borne by conflict and violence The low        socioeconomic status of women along with the current conflict makes the women in this        region particularly vulnerable  Save the Children Norways recent study         Impacts of Armed Conflict Pushing Women and Girls Into Sexual Abuse and Sex        Trade  revealed that about  of female sex workers stated they had entered the sex        trade directly because of the conflict         While the number of people infected has risen HIV prevention and awareness work has        declined in Nepal as a result of the conflict Save the Childrens work in the Accham        district of western Nepal has been hindered by fighting between the Maoist rebels and        government forces since early   Offices of nongovernmental organizations NGOs        have been burned and volunteers are afraid to work  Mdecins Sans Frontires was        forced to curtail its activities last year in Jumla one of the poorest districts in the        Midwest due to the conflict Local activists fear that the situation will continue to        deteriorate if NGOs are not allowed to work in Jumla People living with HIVAIDS in rural        Nepal are desperate for care and support                    Condom Use        In a study of young men in Nepal in  only  of men used a condom consistently         The vast majority of young men about  who had sex with nonregular partners felt        they were not at risk of contracting any form of sexually transmitted disease or HIV         The reasons for nonuse included fear of losing sexual pleasure embarrassment over buying        condoms and a belief that careful selection of partners offers sufficient protection         Monitoring of behavioural trends has shown that condom use during the last sexual encounter        as reported by female sex workers has markedly increased from  in  to  in                 However consistent use of condoms as reported by female sex workers  still needs        improvement  Many female sex workers are young children and lack the power to        negotiate safe sex  Many of the young girls are considered free of disease by clients        who see no need to use condoms These girls command a high price as virgins for brothel        owners who do not want to disturb the situation by requiring condom use  Further the        weakening of traditional sociocultural constraints in times of conflict makes the girls        more prone to sexual abuse and exploitation and more likely to engage in highrisk sexual        behaviour                    The Local and International Response to the Epidemic        Nepals National Center for AIDS and STD Control has received support from WHO UNAIDS        UNDP and USAID But it lacks substantive funding to complete the necessary studies and        interventions that are the key to HIV control National efforts aimed at awareness of HIV        are complicated by the ethnic diversity of Nepal where some  different ethnic groups        exist speaking more than  languages        A network of about  NGOs is now working on HIVAIDS in Nepal Local organisations        are doing their best to reach out to those living with HIVAIDS but due to the        urbancentric nature of most funding funds available for the rural areas are scarce Most        donor representatives lack direct knowledge of the rural areas and rely on the instructions        provided by NGOs in Kathmandu to dispense funds        Foreign aid which accounts for nearly  of Nepals development budget may have        paradoxically contributed to lopsided development in Nepal While aid money has favoured        urban development and centralized power the ruralurban gap has widened over the years In        Nepal weak linkages between urban and rural areas and lack of roads communications        infrastructure and appropriate skills among the rural poor mean that this urban bias has        led to centralization of effective power on the one hand and maintenance of the economic        social and political status quo on the other  Urban biases inevitably play a        deterrent role discouraging poor patients from seeking help The poor see very little of        the aid money since most of it is used for prevention information and awareness in urban        centres rather than for care and support in rural areas        In our experience some donors consider HIV care and support to be too expensive to        fund arguing that Nepal lacks the kind of infrastructureclinics district hospitals and        distribution unitsneeded to provide effective antiretroviral treatment and that        antiretrovirals are a priority only in countries with a high prevalence of HIVAIDS  or        more in the general population         Harmreduction interventions have been shown to slow the course of HIV among intravenous        drug users IDUs in many developed countries  but in Nepal the concept of harm        reduction is still new Few harmreduction programs are governmentsupported or integrated        into mainstream service delivery Organisations such as the Lifesaving and Lifegiving        Society a streetbased NGO established in Nepal in  have been providing education        counselling and primary health careas well as bleach sterile water condoms and new        needles and syringesto IDUs to lower their risk of acquiring bloodborne diseases         The prevalence of HIV infection among IDUs who were in regular contact with the program        from  to  was low at          However successful these programs have not reached the border zones with India where        HIV infection has risen dramatically among IDUs This dramatic rise is not surprising since        research has shown that crossborder druguse patterns in areas of Nepal bordering India        are particularly conducive to risky needle sharing  Unlike IDUs in other Nepalese        towns very few of the IDUs in border towns belong to stable injecting groups Sharing of        contaminated injecting equipment in border towns is widespread in part because of the        makeshift arrangements in which the crossborder injecting takes place Users often share        their small amounts of money to buy drugs Sexual intercourse with casual partners occurs        with inconsistent condom use  Effective intervention would therefore require complex        crossborder collaborative efforts         People living with HIVAIDS are stigmatized and face discrimination at all societal        levelsin the community at health facilities and most importantly within the family         In a recent survey by CARENepal almost half of those who came to the voluntary        counselling and testing centre at the Doti District Hospital in Silgadhi a        conflictaffected area during JuneJuly  tested positive for HIV and almost all of        those tested positive were widows in their twenties and thirties  About  of them        were breastfeeding their infants These young widows faced rejection from their families        discrimination at work and difficulty in coping with their life circumstances         One important development in recent years has been within the area of condom promotion        for HIVAIDS prevention A national research study found that  of retail outlets        surveyed had never sold a condom in   Population Services International began a        national condom promotion program in early   using a threepronged approach  a        national media campaign promoting condoms Figure   increased widespread condom        availability within the private sector to destigmatize condom use and  targeted condom        promotion to highrisk groups such as sex workers  The impact of such efforts on        condom sales has been dramatic Total sale of condoms jumped from  million units in         to  million units in  and sales continue to climb  Creating longterm        behaviour change and making condoms accessible in the private sector and affordable through        subsidy to highrisk groups such as female sex workers appears to be increasing the uptake        of condoms in Nepal                    A Window of Opportunity        There is a window of opportunity to combat HIVAIDS in Nepal If trends continue AIDS        will be the leading cause of death among yearolds in the next ten years          to  young adults could be infected and  to  annual AIDS deaths could        occur in the next ten years  What steps must be taken to prevent Nepal from being        devastated by the infection        First we must gather better data on HIV seroprevalence on sexual behaviour in the        general population and on sexual networking  We have argued in this essay that the        extent of the AIDS epidemic in Nepal will depend upon rates at which sexual partners are        exchanged by commercial sex workers and the men who regularly visit them as well as the        proportion of the general population that has multiple and concurrent sexual partners        There are extensive migration patterns both within the country and internationally fuelled        by the recent conflict which provide the potential for considerable sexual networking        Better knowledge of this networking is crucial for our HIV control efforts        Second the government must recognize and acknowledge the needs of highrisk groupsdrug        users commercial sex workers migrant workers and men who have sex with men Plans to        create more behaviour changes are needed within these groups The  HIVAIDS        strategy proposed by the government  which adopts a multisectoral approach focusing on        prevention among vulnerable groups on control care and support and on voluntary        counselling hopes to address some of these issues        Third information campaigns should focus on changing attitudes that create barriers to        regular use of condoms Condoms should be readily available and research should focus on        the impact of mass media on perceptions of risk negative attitudes toward condoms and        risky behaviour  A culturally specific approach to HIV prevention is needed that        includes education of clients and brothel owners about condoms        Fourth the various players involved in addressing HIV and who are working in closely        adjacent fields need to interact more and partner with each other and there needs to be        greater inclusion of civil society in campaigns to raise HIVAIDS awareness and reduce        stigma        Finally successful national programs that have the scale to alter the course of the        epidemic in Nepal should be expanded                    Conclusion        HIVAIDS is no longer only a health issue it is also a development issue Tackling the        epidemic will require not only prevention and control of HIV infection among vulnerable and        risk groups but a multisectoral approach addressing the lack of access by risk groups to        health care and education and recognition of the populations at risk  People living        with HIV and AIDS should be brought to the forefront in the fight against HIVAIDS         Family members local communities civil society organizations donors and the government        all have their own important role to play  The status of women must change so that        they are considered autonomous individuals who can make their own decisions         As with all international declarations on HIVAIDS there is an absolute need to take a        strong human rights approach to combating the epidemic This approach includes recognizing        fundamental rights such as access to health care and information addressing gender equity        and a concerted effort to reduce sex trafficking It further requires addressing the root        causes of poverty and inequality which give rise to the phenomenon of migration and        trafficking as well as propagate violent uprisings Only such efforts will prevail in        mitigating the effects of both HIV and conflict in Nepal
