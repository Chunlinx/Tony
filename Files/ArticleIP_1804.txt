                                 Flytrap Tonight That Was an Apology            I just watched thepresidents speech at Jonah Goldbergs DC apartment It is here that LucianneGoldberg first met Linda Tripp and here that Newsweek s Mike Isikoffrefused to listen to the Lewinsky tapes Jonahs apartment in short is thesafe house of the vast rightwing conspiracy I figure theres no better placeto watch the climax of Flytrap than the place where it began            Jonahwho is a friend but not an ideological soul mate has stocked the apartmentwith conservative pals and they are in high glee This is a night ofvindication for them not a night of magnanimity Jonah answers the phoneGloating Central and during the Larry King pregame show every appearance ofJames Carville is greeted with hoots of laughter This is not the audience ofaverage Americans who are supposed to watch Clinton apologize forgive himandto use the nights phrasemove on with their lives It does notsurprise me that Clintons speech wasnt enough for them Nothing he could saywould have been enough for them But it does surprise me that Clintons speechwasnt enough for me I arrived at Jonahs in a forgiving mood Lets get thisover with I left a bit puzzled            As theater the Map Room talk was a minor masterpieceClinton looked fresh despite his horrible afternoon He wore a fine blue powersuit He wisely kept Hillary out of the picture Any awkwardness between themwould have been disastrous The Map Room was the right choice The Oval Officewould have been presumptuous and seamy Wheres that private study Bill            But as anapology this was a feeble effort Nobody expected Clinton to make a baldfacedconfession The American people need to know if their president is a lechI am a lech  But I think almost everyone expected him to at least admitit I certainly did It may have been a mea culpa  but there wasnt muchculpa to show for it He sounded angry not sorry He conceded aninappropriate relationship He allowed that he has misled the Americanpeople He took complete responsibility But all those are champion weaselexpressions What does it mean to take complete responsibility Do youactually have to do anything painful when you take it What is aninappropriate relationship Is it sexual Whats the difference betweenmisleading and lying My favorite moment of the evening came when ABC punditstried to parse Clintons comments about the Paula Jones deposition They gaveup baffled His words defy comprehension He believes language is a weapon ofconfusion            Instead of turning belly up Clinton followedthe golden rule of spin When youre explaining youre losing The presidentwho has always felt more comfortable attacking than defending artfully turnedhis apology into a broadside against Ken Starr He did this despite endlesspregame predictions that he would leave Starr alone By the way was anyone whohas ever expressed an opinion about Flytrap not on television tonightAt one point I counted  separate pundits most of them on Larry KingLive             Out ofthe four minutes for which he spoke Clinton spent about one minute explaininghimself and the rest complaining about Starr the intrusion upon his privatelife and the distraction of the nation from serious matters The speech wasless about Clintons sins than Starrsa stella culpa  as it were            This raises the curious paradox about the Map Room speechAs argument it was unassailable Clinton is absolutely correct that Starrsinvestigations have gone on too long cost too much and hurt too manyinnocent people He is absolutely correct that his personal life has beeninvaded in ways that no ones should He is absolutely correct that Flytrap hashorribly distracted politicians journalists and the public from criticalissues of the day These points are not only true they are also polltestedBut tonight was not the night to make such arguments He should have left theStarr bashing to his deputies Carville was doing a superb job of it            Tonight was the night forabject apology for contrition for explanation Tonight was the night to eatcrow Its a bit much for Clinton three hours after he finished testifying tostart impugning Starrs credibility Clinton after all is one who lied to usClinton is the one who screwed or whatever the yearold intern and triedto cover it up Clinton is the one who has delayed and stonewalled us for sevenmonths            For thepast few weeks at regular intervals Republican politicians have been tellingus that we are a forgiving people Im sure theyre right But can you forgivesomeone who hasnt really asked for forgiveness            Flytrap Today The complete chronicles            More Flytrap
