article The Great Fleece Panic of  takes the New YorkTimes to task for reporting Christmascatalog and retail shortages thenends withcan it bea sales pitch for where to find LL Bean Lands Endand J Crew on the Web True there were other references at the end of thearticle for Buy Nothing Day and Adbusters but the premise of Shaferscommentary was that the New York Times Tardy Catalogue Shoppers RiskLosing Out Dec   fabricated a catalog shortage in order to herdshoppers into buying thereby playing the role of a shameless pawn in theAmerican sales game            I was not a tardy catalogueshopper I didnt wait till the last minute I dogged the pages of a number ofcatalogs in November and called in my selections before Thanksgiving in orderto ensure ample delivery time What I got was out of stock backorderedor not available for just about everything I chose I thought I was justhaving rotten luck The New York Times  Tardy Shoppers article whichI read for what it wasa consumer reportwas a muchneeded reality check            MrShafer obviously didnt order anything from a catalog before Christmas                            Cydney Gillis                                       AmazonPleasure                        Jonathan Chait and StephenGlass piece AmazonCon doesnt jibe with my personal experience Im arelatively new Web user My girlfriend was attempting to find a book for aChristmas present and had struck out at about half a dozen bookstores aroundManhattan I had heard about Amazon so we went online with my new PowerComputing machine We found the book she was looking for and found a couple ofother interesting books My girlfriend enjoyed browsing through the lists ofNobel and National Book Award winners as well as the Amazon EditorsFavorites section            In the end a couple of dayslater Amazon emailed us telling us that the hardtofind volume was infact out of print and that the rest of our order was on the way We got thebooks in a timely fashion In sum my experience with Amazon was good Theydidnt work magic by finding books bookstores couldnt but they did deliver ontheir promises and Amazon certainly presents some interesting browsing methodsand far better search facilities than most bookstores            Im notsure precisely why you favor the overblown megabookstores over Amazon Theyboth have their place and I for one am glad that Borders and Barnes Noble have some genuine competition I agree that there is nothing like goingto a bookstore on a cold winter morning but there is also nothing likediscovering an interesting new author while sitting in your home in your robesipping a cup of coffee How many books they physically have in their warehousehas no relevance to me                           ShemmyMishaan                                       BarnesNobleNightmare                        In your article AmazonCon you compareorder time on the phone for a traditional bookstore vs Amazoncom online andwait for the UPS driver to show upwhile not addressing the question ofconvenience            Have youever had to fight your way through and wait in line at a Barnes  Noble inManhattan or lived in Tokyo where the closest Borders bookstore is in SanFrancisco You ignore the big picture on how the Internet is changing how webuy books and give me nothing but the impression that Slate ie Microsoftdoes not want to share the spotlight with another Seattle native                           Guy Cheney                                       TheAmazonian Experience                        I chuckled at first readingthe AmazonCon article but then stopped realized that the first ofApril was still months away and that Chait and Glass were serious Let meillustrate the absurdity of their review            I walked into Borders Books Music to find The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth  by JohnAllegro At first I was astonished that I had to walk through the store to findthe archeology section I then had to read several book spines using awelladapted pseudobinarysearch algorithm I have developed in my brain overthe years looking for the authors name It was not to be found I then stoodconfused for a few moments until a human male confronted me with a questionCan I help you find something            I figured this must be somebiological version of a search engine so I said The Dead Sea Scrolls andthe Christian Myth  by John Allegro hoping the query was syntacticallycorrect I was disappointed with the speed at which the engine performed forhe as did I moments before searched the archeology section though withperhaps a less welladapted algorithm and found nothing Then he suggested thereligion section toward which I was led still on foot He again browsed thebooks visually and pulled a tome from the shelf Here it is Is there anythingelse I can do            I grabbed the book looked atthe cover Yes indeed this was the book in question Yes I said I wantedthe scroll translations and a couple of other books on the same subject Ididnt know the titles A list of all books by author Vermes first nameunknown having to do with Dead Sea Scrolls also books by Richard Leigh and aguy with the last name Baigent on any subject I need publishing dates and ohyeah prices By the expression on his face I knew for sure I had blunderedthe syntax this time            Amazoncom is not a physicalbookstore and Borders is not an electronic bookstore You cant browse titleson a shelf if theyre not there and you cant drink caf latte over anasynchronous connection Theyre different My first Amazon order was placed ona Friday and arrived on Tuesday My last order placed at about the same timethe articles authors ordered took about nine days I have paid withshipping about the same for books through Amazon as I would have at a localbookstore But I have found books on Amazons site that are certainlynonexistent on Borders shelves If you gotta order it you gotta order it            I remember taking some timefilling out the form for my initial order I dont know how long it took but Iwas taking my time making sure everything was correct I dont remember itbeing difficult And now after selecting my books it takes me less than aminute to order I type in my email address my password select creditcard punch my way through about three are you really sure screens and myorder is in Amazon remembers who I am where my books are going and mycreditcard information It couldnt take me  minutes as Chait and Glasssuggest even if I were typing with the back of my head            Did I mention I never have towait in line at Amazon            Sometrick Some con                           FrankWayne
