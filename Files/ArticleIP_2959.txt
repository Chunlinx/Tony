                                 STOP the World I Want to Get Off            Ill bet that very fewpeople who begin William Greiders new page book will read every word ofit Like his page tome on the Federal Reserve Secrets of the Temple it would have been vastly improved by being cut perhaps in halfEntire arguments and quotations are repeated from chapter to chapter Most ofthe chapters include a tedious travelogue Here for example is Greidersdescription of Mexico City Its European grace notes the broad boulevards andcastles inherited from colonial eras were splashed with wild magical colorsthat could only be described as Mexican             But Iwould also bet that anyone who gets through this book except perhaps for afew economists and Treasury officials will feel a pang of regret for nottaking Pat Buchanan or Ross Perot more seriously last year Not that the authoris a Buchananite or a Perotista a former Washington Post editor andcurrently a political writer for Rolling Stone  Greider is liberal andcosmopolitan But in One World Ready or Not  Greider explains whyAmericans should feel anxious about their place in the new world economyananxiety that Buchanan and Perot addressed however imperfectly and that DoleClinton and many of Americas opinion makers ignored I may be prejudicedbecause I share Greiders political point of view but I think this is the bestbook to date on the perils of the new world economic order It does for thepostBretton Woods world of currency swaps runaway shops and technologytransfers what his earlier book did for the Fed It makes a daunting subjectsomewhat comprehensibleand harrowing            The book contains a core argument about industry and laborwhich I believe to be true Greider contends that in many keyindustriesincluding autos textiles steel ships aircraft chemicalscomputers and drugsthe worlds companies are capable of producing far morethan the worlds consumers can buy Such overcapacity in autos for instanceruns as high as  percent and will probably rise as each country tries todevelop its own automaking industry And the overcapacity problem is gettingworse for a couple of reasons Advances in technology allow industries toproduce more goods with fewer people in effect creating more supply but lessdemand Meanwhile Japan China and other Asian nations have adoptedmercantilist trade strategies that is they have sought through barriers orgovernment subsidies to guarantee surpluses By definition such a strategyexpands the supply of goods without proportionately boosting demand            Overcapacity reduces the incentive for businesses to invest and leads to slowerworld growth as supply continually threatens to outrun demand Put thistogether with the new mobility of capitalthe ability of companies to movetheir manufacturing facilities wherever the costs are lowestand you have theingredients for an international race to the bottom in wages and socialbenefits as companies seek to cut costs in the face of this overcapacity andheightened competition for markets            In the United States the quest to lower costsencourages corporate managers to destroy unions Its the class war all overagain Greider notes only worse In historical terms he writesrevolutionary capitalism has circled back to its original fight with socialisma century ago and reopened the ideological argument but from a much strongerpolitical position Labor and the left are in retreat almost everywherecommerce and finance predominate in politics and have adapted centralizedgovernment to their own uses            Greideralso undertakes an ambitious analysis of global finance In this area I amless confident of my own knowledgeand therefore of his conclusions But hisarguments are provocative and address seeming anomalies that conventionaltheorists have failed to address let alone explain For instance Greiderargues that the unexpected rise in interest rates in  after theClinton administration had reduced the deficitwas the result of an entirelyseparate drama played out among private bondholders who wildly overinvestedthe previous year In explaining why economic growth has lagged over the lasttwo decades Greider singles out the deregulation of finance by both nationaland international bodies The ensuing volatility of currencyexchange rates heargues has made businesses projections of profits from trade increasinglyunreliable thereby discouraging productive investments and growth            Greider also argues that deregulation helped make the valueof advanced nations financial assets grow faster than their actual economiesFrom  to  Greider notes financial assets from advanced nations haveexpanded at  percent a year about twice as fast as the economies themselveswere growing That has led to a worldwide situation comparable to Japansbubble economy where with assets systematically overvalued a crash becameinevitable But while Japans Ministry of Finance has ably managed thatcountrys crisis there is no comparable global body to police the worldsystem            InSecrets of the Temple  Greider warned that central banks had taken overUS economic policies He now acknowledges that power has shifted to theglobal market and its private players who like George Soros possess thepower to overturn government currency decisions According to Greider in the five major central banks of the world held  billion in foreign exchangereserves compared with  billion a day that was traded on average inforeignexchange markets In  the central banks had  billion inreserves but the private market was trading  billion a day As the powerof traders and private bankers has grown government economic policy has becomehostage to the financiers and speculators fears that economic growth willspur inflation which will reduce the value of their holdings So governmentsfollow the financiers prescriptions for curbing inflationslower growththrough a balanced budget and higher interest rates They end up doing all theycan to eliminate the one instrumentrapid economic growthby which they mightclose the gap between finance and industry This commitment to slow growthwrites Greider does protect the value of money and financial assets but itis like a noose thrown around the advanced economies sure to deepen theirimbalances in production and employment            The upshot of all this Greider worries mightbe a repeat of the s During that decade industry and finance were alsostrangely out of step with each other and nations also faced a conflictbetween popular welfare and the imperatives of the market For Greider therise of Buchanan in the United States and rightwing nationalism in Europe is aforetaste of a  st century fascism As an alternative he suggestsa moderate middle ground between the rentier capitalisms status quoof balanced budgets and wage and benefit cuts on the one hand and a hardreactionary politics that can shut down the system on the other The latterwould probably call for shutting off immigration erecting permanenthightariff walls and solving the problem of unemployment by stigmatizingthe least employable Between these extremes lie Greiders own solutions whichhe summarizes thus            Restorenational controls over global capital Tax wealth more labor less Stimulateglobal growth by boosting consumer demand from the bottom up Compel tradingnations to accept more balanced trade relations and absorb more surplusproduction Forgive the debtors especially the hopeless cases among the verypoorest nations Reorganize monetary policy to confront the realities of aglobalized money supply both to achieve greater stability and open the way togreater growth Defend labor rights in all marketsprohibit the ancient abusesrenewed in the dark Satanic mills            Some of his more specific suggestions strike me as lessthan helpful Greider wants to change the tax incentives and subsidies forprivate enterprise by rewarding firms that fostered greater employment andpenalizing those that did the opposite That would in effect penalizecompanies for efficiency and productivity But other suggestions make sense Hewants the United States to join with other financial centers in adopting atransactions tax on currency exchanges to stanch speculation and inhibit wideswings in currency values Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers onceendorsed this idea He wants the United States to adopt an emergency tariffof between  percent and  percent on imports to force other countries toabandon their mercantile trading strategies And he wants the World TradeOrganization to adopt binding standards for international labor rights to slowthe race to the bottom            Unfortunately even thesesuggestions are unlikely to be adopted The same trends in the world economythat cry out for reform are themselves weakening the hand of the reformers Forinstance as the mobility of capital reduces the power of unions the chancefor including labor rights in the world trade treaty known as GATTthe GeneralAgreement on Trade and Tariffsgrows remote As American multinationals shiptheir production overseas the likelihood of getting business to support animport tariff which would now tax their                own imports becomesequally small            But does that mean that weface a repeat of the dark years of soup kitchens and brownshirts leading up toworld war Greider suggests we could replay the terrible conflicts of thetwentieth century I find that a little extremeor at least difficult toforesee Yet Greiders less bold but still frightful assertion that theglobal system  will probably experience a series of terribleeventswrenching calamities that are economic or social or environmental innature seems well within the realm of plausibility
