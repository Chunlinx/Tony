                                 Deregulate New York City                        The biggest news here in New York City last week was the sudden crackdown ondoubleparking Traffic cops descended on Upper West Side neighborhoods andmidtown business streets and issued a slew of tickets Because residents areaccustomed to doubleparking on days when streetcleaning takes placeyoudoublepark from  to  am blocking in all the people who are parkedlegallythe crackdown was assailed as the effective criminalization of anaccepted social custom In some sense it probably was and in Moneyboxtomorrow Ill have something on whether this matters But the moreinteresting aspect of Rudy Giulianis latest attempt to bring order to our faircity was the way it showcased how little parking there is in New York            Now as someone who drives fairly often into the city Im pleased by thecrackdown since doubleparkers have the magical ability to turn threelaneavenues as wide as an Interstate into slowmoving country roads New Yorkdrivers will happily doublepark even while theyre in their cars rather thanpark a car too close to a fire hydrant even though doing the latter will lettraffic move smoothly Im hoping the recent crackdown will change this habitAnd its certainly true that most doubleparkers are just people trying toavoid paying for a parking garage or deliverymen trying to avoid having towalk around the corner So no pity for them Except when theyre me or myfriends of course But people want to avoid paying for a spot in a parkinggarage because  seems a bit much for a halfhour And in any case parkinggarages are usually full These two phenomena are not needless to sayunrelated            In fact there are way too few parking garages in New York relative to thetraffic because the city since the end of World War II has limited thenumber of garages that can be built For the existing garage owners this is agreat deal since it means that in most neighborhoods theres effectively nocompetition Parking real estate is not quite as valuable as land in theHamptons but it has a similar characteristic The supply isnt getting anybigger even as the demand grows            There was an idea behind the limits on garages which was that if you makeit easier for people to park in the city you make it easier for them to driveinto the city and we dont want that But in a deeper sense the limits ongarages are emblematic of the way successive administrations in New York havehandled most things They have consistently assumed that without a strongmanagerial hand the city would degenerate into chaos            Take taxis Why is it so hard to get a cab in midtown especially on a rainyday Because obtaining a taxi medallion is next to impossible and the price ofthe medallions has soared out of sight Cab fares are of course regulatedbut that means only that the pricing is determined by whateverrelationshipgood or badexists between the Taxi Commission and the smallnumber of companies its dealing with Opening the market to new competitorswould increase the number of taxis on the streetthats the whole ideaand itwould drive down prices The fear seems to be that if you opened the marketyoud have a deluge of cabs marring the relatively pristine streets ofManhattan And perhaps you would at first But pretty quickly the supply ofcabs in the city would approximate the demand            A similar point can be made about rent control and about the haphazardapplication of zoning ordinances to commercial establishments Pace arecent Chatterbox piece New York is certainly an exception to his rule aboutcheap movie tickets and one reason is that there are too few movie theatershere to meet the demand Thats partly because of the high cost of real estatebut its also about the sheer effort it takes to negotiate with the city tobuild a movie theater            One might say Thank god someone is looking out for the city instead of letting it be taken over by developers and entrepreneurialcabcompany owners In that sense the implicit governing philosophy in NewYork has been avoid the tragedy of the commons while also letting the peopleon the inside wet their beaks over and over again I dont really think a cityis a commons that will be destroyed if there isnt someone to tell us all whatto do But if it is then all those ticketed doubleparkers are just necessaryvictims on the continued path to order
