        okay do have  yep   are you there okay  okay   there okay had to mess with my phone here um do you have children   yes i have one   oh okay i have three yeah yeah uh do you work   how about you   oh my goodness yeah i do i do i work and and uh Brians in a day care center hes uh he was two in December so hes not quite two and a half yet he uh i put him im   okay oh uhhuh   kind of had different different ideas from what probably the majority of people have i put him in a day care center from the very beginning he started in day care when he was eight weeks old   uhhuh oh no kidding     and i just i dont know i have kind of the opposite opinion of most people i have had this real problem with a a private individual i mean i i kind of looked at it like   really uhhuh   if you take him to a home with a with private individual when the door shuts   yeah   that one person has total control and i always figured at least in a day care center there are other people around and if you get one bad apple theres are at least other people that can see it they can watch and i just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening were less   yeah yeah yeah yeah umhum because theres   you know how can you help depending on the day care center you know you got to   yeah   when you hear about all the horrible things that happen in day care centers have you ever noticed theyre always like a family owned center where the mother and the daughter and the son run it you know kind of thing i mean its its a   its like a family thing   yeah yeah you never hear about it really in the big ones so thats what i did and i have had just excellent luck i have been just so happy hes   yeah oh good oh good i was just going to ask you how it you know if you liked the the but obviously you do or you wouldnt have him there  i know but     right right well he was in he was in the same center for two years for the first two years and uh it was wonderful and i loved it and i was so happy there and the woman who owned it sold it   uhhuh yeah oh gosh   but i thought okay im going to keep an open mind here and the people who came in it just wasnt it just wasnt the same and their their attitude and philosophy was just completely opposite from mine and i   right wasnt the same uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   left him there for about a month and just decided i cant do this anymore and i moved him which was an extremely traumatic experience but but hes done well hes been there a couple of months now and i just feel so lucky yeah   yeah was it yeah good oh good thats great thats good well i got to stay home with my kids for the first ten years my oldest one is ten and a half now   how about you do you work or do you get to stay home with them wonderful   or shes i guess yeah its was about ten years so i yeah i i was really happy that i was able to do that but i thats what i wanted to because i uh you know i just couldnt wait to have kids and so if i was i was so anxious to have them and i couldnt wait to have them it would be kind of silly you know to go back to work as soon as i had them so so it it it it was really great by the end of the ten years i was really ready   right right yeah i bet   to go back to work and my youngest was only uh two and a half i mean she was already two and a half so it wasnt you know she wasnt an infant   uhhuh uhhuh he didnt leave the baby yeah   yeah yeah so i felt real good about that but uh boy i tell you with summer coming up im just pulling my hair out in terms of what im going to do i i guess i went back to work about a year and a half ago       and uh i worked full time all last year and now im going to school part time and uh graduate school and im working part time and so im still yeah im still going full time but i only have half time salary   i know how it goes uhhuh yeah   and uh when school lets out i just dont i havent i have no idea what im going to do because i certainly cant afford what we did last year   right right did you have them in a center or something last summer   which was well we did we tried we had all different things we sent them to camp one first month in June they went to summer school then the second month they uh one my daughter went home to visit my Mom for a while and my son uh went to camp and there we had uh i dont know some forget what else we did but it was all uh really expensive   yeah that stuff is expensive it really is   so now theyre a year older and i my daughters eleven going to be eleven this summer and my son will be nine and a half and so im not i think i can leave them home for a if i can work part of the day you know im going to leave them home right   are these yeah yeah i was going to say theyre getting to the age where you should be able to trust that a little bit yeah   right yes in fact im doing that right now with their afternoons when they get home before i do you know thats okay but the four year old now i have i have had her since i went back to work or before i went back to work really in a home day care   uhhuh   situation and uh weve just been really thrilled with it too we were what actually we it took us two or three different people to find   to find the right one thats what we have to do though   yeah right but i wasnt embarrassed to shop around you know so the the person we found it through the theres an association here in town of professional home care providers or something like that in Plano   no no where do where do you live Plano okay   yeah and they have a number you can call and all these people are registered with their association and you know go like our our uh i dont want to call her a baby sitter shes doesnt like to be called that   care provider   care provider right she goes to seminars and uh she gets home visitations by this state uh uh i dont know the state boards i guess some of them and then some by the association and they   oh thats wonderful   have weekly meetings and everything and so its just really really well regulated   thats great   and shes just great in fact uh shes all upset because Galen is going to go to kindergarten next fall and she says this is it you know im not going to have her anymore and i said oh no dont count on that  after noon classes shes going to be here because shes going to morning kindergarten so     right right   but we weve tried weve tried everything and one year i guess last year when i went back to work i had my son was eight at the time just barely eight and uh we put him in Amreins Day Care after   uhhuh ive heard that they were very good   after well thats why we picked it because they were were supposed to be real great and you know i think they were fine but the thing is he was in school all day   uhhuh   in second grade in in Plano its open classroom situation where they dont have walls so there is like a hundred and twenty second graders   uhhuh oh   in the same area with no walls and uh and then hed get on the Amreins Bus to go to Amreins and then there would be a whole ton of other kids all in the same room you know you know what fun they had with these computer games and then theyd go outside for awhile they had snacks and story time and everything but it was just like going to school until five thirty at night   yeah poor kid was in school all day yeah yeah   instead of being able to get home at two thirty yeah because he was always around with a crowd of kids and he just really missed being able to be by himself and having some  peace and quiet or you know   uhhuh uhhuh even at that age they need that time we all need that time   yes yeah   just some quiet time to wind down from the day   right thats exactly it so another thing that we tried to do i i know your sons too young right now but were trying we tried to sign him up for after school scouts and stuff like that and   yeah yeah i think thats really important and weve already started about you know i mean how young can they start T ball and soccer  you know i mean i just you know we both think of that that as just so important to get him involved in stuff like that and   yeah right right yeah it is it is and   you could hardly wait i mean hes hes so much fun now hes really hes really starting to get lots of fun and i cant wait until stuff like that starts happening you know and you know we did the Easter egg hunts which was really the first year he was really able to   yeah i bet yeah uhhuh     and to know what we want know what he was doing you know and enjoy it and it was so much fun and gosh he went a couple of weekends ago and rode an elephant and God he got up on this elephant all by himself and Lord i couldnt believe it they had so much fun   yeah   right oh my gosh you are kidding youre kidding oh thats great   i bought us tickets and stood there in line and i thought im going to end up on this elephant with him  you know he did it by himself so stuff like that is starting to come along where its really getting fun you know but     well good for him uhhuh uhhuh yeah   day care has just done just incredible stuff with him and he like comes home with something new everyday you know and so I know i know theyre working with him and hes   well thats great thats so good   excited to get there in the morning and just doesnt even want to kiss me goodbye its just like bye and he goes running you know and hes always having fun when i pick him up so you know yeah this this day care is is   uhhuh hes out of there yeah uhhuh   its Bright Steps in Louisville and whenever you say Bright Steps everybody goes oh ive heard thats the best day care in town you know and its its one of those thats very hard to get into and they have   uhhuh yeah good uhhuh   this this this woman owns three day cares two in Lewisville and one in Irving and she had to open the second one up in Lewisville because her waiting list was just like   uhhuh uhhuh   you know like a year old it was ridiculous and shes got two day cares within like three blocks of each other yes so its i mean shes   oh my gosh no kidding she knows something right that she needs if   she knows what shes doing all the teachers like about half the teachers are degreed teachers and oh it makes a huge difference   yeah that makes such a difference thats the way it is at my daughters nursery school too and i think that really makes a difference theyre in it because its a profession not because its a job they could get because they didnt qualify for anything else you know   uhhuh yeah thats right thats right thats right and his old day care as much as i loved it you know and the owner i really liked her and she worked really hard to get good people but the people that she got   uhhuh yeah uhhuh   were there because they werent qualified to do anything else you know and and i got lucky and all of his teachers were very good   uhhuh right because because right some sometimes thats fine thats great you know sometimes it isnt you just have to well is it real expensive then   yeah but then sometimes you know yeah um it just went up the first of this month im paying uh seventy nine dollars a week for now   uhhuh wow yeah   so its a little high but but its you know its like where he was before i was only paying sixty three so theres quite a little jump there but i looked all over Louisville   right right   i looked in every day care there was in Louisville and you know and there were places that were cheaper but is it   uhhuh no yeah   you know your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money you know and i have peace of mind where he is and some of those other places i wouldnt have   yeah uhhuh thats exactly it see we do the same thing since Galen goes to nursery school we pay our our home care provider for our day care provider full time for a whole week but she shes gone three mornings Galen just doesnt go there three mornings a week but i said to her i said you know it doesnt matter if   yeah   for whatever reason when school holidays come around i used to have such a problem with that they wouldnt have anything to do id either have to   uhhuh uh
