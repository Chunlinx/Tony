                have you ever got one of those calls thats either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list and theyre either offering a service or theyre introducing some new product in the area and normally when they call youre either in the shower or you in the middle of cooking something and you had to stop everything to run to the phone   yes yes that is that one that you were talking about   that was the big one im talking about i work weird hours and invariably just about the time im going to sleep the phone tears off the wall   uhhuh uhhuh   and youre trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone you either hear the click as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on     umhum   or you hear somebody already starting reading reading off a list of stuff that theyve read probably a thousand times that day already   thats true or the ones that are are generated by a computer its just a computer voice that comes on the line those are the ones that i really really hate too   even had some of them the theyre voice activated and youve got to say hello twice before theyll do anything   uhhuh uhhuh yeah sometimes i i get them on my uh answering machine at home so and i hate that when ive got a whole bunch of messages and i go through them and most of them arent from anybody at all   what i would love to see done to stop all of this   uhhuh   weve got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted   umhum   i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think its great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything but if theyre going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them   umhum yeah see i have an unlisted telephone number but i still get all of those calls and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i dont even understand so yeah i do i really feel that thats uh an invasion of my privacy i agree with you on that particular subject there let me see   thats about that as far as any other everyday occurrences i put a stop to some of them as far as the doortodoor either religious groups or people   umhum   peddling products if i wanted their products i wouldve either gone to the store to bought it or i wouldve called for their salesman salesman to come out   umhum umhum yeah thats true living in an apartment complex though you know you cant um you cant really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations uh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around so usually what i do is ill call the apartment manager and tell him hey theres people coming around you know and theyre trying to sell something or or theyre from a religious organization and i really hate that i really really do i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago and um gosh it was about nine oclock at night too it wasnt even what i would consider you know a family hour its time to you know start going to bed and uh and it was somebody from um oh what was it the uh Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and uh ive read a lot about uh that particular sect and i dont particularly care for it so i especially dont like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me   now i agree with their right to um pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but i think they also should respect the sanctity of the American home whether it be in a house or in an apartment   umhum   im on my turf if i want them there ill call for them otherwise i dont want to know they exist   right yeah yeah no i i agree with you there though i mean they want to choose that particular religion then thats fine with me too you know as long as they dont try and pull me in and drag me in and and i dont like the way that they do it either and and its their mission as they do as they go doortodoor and they go out into the public and they actually have the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work and i dont know i just um i just dont particularly care for that at all and that thats one thing that i feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door especially religious organizations and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion because i have my own   now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting ive even gone so far as to put that ive got a storm door on the front of the house and ive put in i dont know how much clearer it can be its a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting i should have guessed i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise because i still get   yeah yeah thats true yeah no i dont uh i dont have i didnt go that far but uh yeah i probably could do the same thing uh you know i dont have a storm door but im sure i could rig up something but you know i dont think that that would stop people i mean its like they they see that word and it says uh go instead of stop oh goodness   wonder if thered be some way we could get these people that do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do well that would be technically illegal itd be harassment     oh gosh   but i consider invasion of my privacy   yeah yeah   a harassment in itself   yeah yeah yeah thats true thats true hm well what else   i believe weve pretty much summed everything up   i know but i remember you you talked about something you started off and you said well let me think you talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door you said something else and i cant remember what it was and i thought yeah that that kind of touched a nerve right there but we got uh we got to talking about the um uh people coming to you at the front door   im drawing the blank     oh goodness okay is our five minutes up   uh pretty close to it well ive enjoyed talking with you   pretty close well it was nice talking to you too Jim   and take it easy now good night   okay thanks bye
