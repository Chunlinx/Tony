          i was afraid for a while she wasnt going to find anyone because they were all out on the golf course   oh really well its its raining in Texas right now in my area so theres probably not any golfers out on the course     okay oh   uh   yeah i   they just they just said that the uh Byron Nelson Tournament here had been suspended   oh no   for because of rain of course thats just for today itll itll play again finish tomorrow you know or finish todays round tomorrow   yeah well near Dallas youre used to playing golf in the wind too   oh right yeah   yeah   well i im not really much of a golfer i have not played golf in probably fifteen years but uh it it is an intention to take up the  the uh sport again   the biggest problem with it i think is time   right uh   yeah and i i know that its a four hour dedication it could be four hour relaxation or it could be gritting on your nerves which youre using that much time uh and not not having that much fun   yeah right well yeah if if youre good at it i guess its a not so much frustration but if you are it it you know if youre not a really good golfer it it can be real frustrating real frustrating   you know and i i played tennis for exercise but i play golf for fun uh and   yeah     apparently its the attitude that you have that makes the big difference the uh       i i enjoy catching it too do you ever go out to the     well i its been a while since ive been out to watch i do watch a little on TV you know when i have the chance but uh   uhhuh uhhuh i keep wondering why i you can understand in sports like uh basketball or baseball or football theres an age   yeah   uh position in there but i keep wondering why some of the real legends cant go just a little bit longer than they do   well you know i wonder that too in watching some of these senior tournaments uh you know the uh the seniors skins and stuff like that on TV you see how well theyre playing and you and you wonder why theyre theyre not able to you know to play with   right      it the regular tour   with the with the younger guys on the regular tour   and they do mix some of them mix it but its uh it it does amaze me sometimes just to see it i dont know whether its a lack of concentration or particular muscle development or what but it seems to be uh       i to me its not a sport that you would be overwhelmed with muscle activity in it   right well as i understand it and of course its like i said its been a while since i played but uh as i understand it as you do get older that your concentration in the putting area you know really suffers and thats thats the primary reason that some of these older that you know that the old players dont play as well   umhum umhum   but uh   i tell you what its a sport that has a great number of jokes though   oh yeah i   i as i said i play tennis and there are no tennis jokes i dont know if you can think of one at all   i guess come to think of it ive never heard a tennis joke     but but there are a slew of golf jokes so it it indicated and its great uh sport for equalizing the handicap system   yeah right and uh   allows you to play competitively even though you dont play on the same level play competitively with just about anyone you know i can go out and stand a chance of winning a dime off of Jack Nicholas   right   uh if the handicap system uh worked properly and it should so   yeah   its nice to be able to to uh compete and and be together with someone and yet have a basis for competitiveness such as uh ten cent be anything over a a dime i joke on so   and perhaps and perhaps even learn a little bit of something     oh yes oh yeah   its interesting were talking about golf the television own in my den right now and im watching a ball roll up about four inches from the hole  in todays Byron Nelson so     well you know thats one of the other things i id im am fascinated sometimes two sports bring it to mind more quickly than any others but all the other functions that the human body performs really are are uh as equally amazing But when you start thinking about the eye hand coordination and trying to get a little sphere uh four hundred and twenty yards away into a little whole in about four shots   uhhuh   and its true you have loft of club and everything else but knowing how far to bring it back and the the concentration and all the things that go on in the human body to get it there   theres a awful lot of mechanics involved in   yeah the same the same thing is true with basketball where a a fellows running along and runs and jumps up in the air and then pushes the basketball toward uh a hoop and it swishes through   yeah   the the the human body is amazing and i think id like to see uh elements like that in almost everything i do and golf uh i walk down the fairways sometimes just thinking about that and then of course ill miss the putt     yeah so well what uh what course do you get to play on over in North Carolina   but we just moved here from from Oklahoma as a matter of fact and id been in Oklahoma for twenty years up in Enid   oh yeah uhhuh   but so uh im used to the wind too   yeah   in fact thats the only that areas the only place i know of that you really have to uh consider the wind on putts  out on the grass green and everything else but the wind effect   yeah yeah yeah but i guess in North Carolina you youre in an area where there are some really nice courses   oh i know it i know we had just moved to Charlotte and uh ive gone to a couple of uh public courses uh we havent settled in here yet were just   uh   here temporarily but a the courses are beautiful and you can play just about year round on it too   yeah thats   now Richardson maybe you can too   yeah right Richardson h as its you know its pretty close to year round there are times uh well i guess that there are times in the winter you know when you cant play but then there are times when you know when it thaws out and warms up and people flock to the golf course you know in December and January so   yeah yeah in fact uh the last few years ive had in Oklahoma i went to Norman and it would play New Years day down there now there it was stretching the imagination to enjoy it         but at least i played   yeah probably a week later it was warm enough you could have gone out and played and really enjoyed it even then so   uhhuh uhhuh well i have enjoyed talking to you   yeah i have enjoyed it too i i really intend to play golf you know in the future my my wife and i even uh   yeah   are going to try to play together sometime you know   yeah yeah well that thats a good sport when people enjoy it because it can be very social at the same time   yeah right well its been nice talking to you okay   good luck on the course   okay you too thanks   bye
