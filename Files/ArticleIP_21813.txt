                                                            Please send your questions for publication to prudenceslatecom                                                         DearPrudie                                                      My husband and I have been together for morethan four years and married for two and a half He has a child with anexgirlfriend My motherinlaw has told me that the ex confessed to planningthe accidental pregnancy because my husband was talking of leaving her andshe hoped it would keep him around I was quite disturbed by this and now moreso since a woman friend of his ex told me she has done the same thing toanother unsuspecting man                                       I feel that someoneneeds to put this woman in her place but dont know if its any of my businessI think if I dont  no one will Shes a bad person to have mad at you bythe way It just doesnt sit well with me to see another child used in thisway and another good man being manipulated like this For some reason I justcant forget about this                Thanks                                       JT                        Dear J            Prudie understands why this issue presses yourbuttons It is not however your job in life to put people in their placesAnother reason for butting out is that you say this latest trapper is a badperson to have mad at you People can get knocked down as well as up youknow What I mean is that by confronting this woman with something that isreally none of your business you run the risk of incurring her enmity andmaking yourself a target for social unpleasantness            There are times when adearly held principle makes interjecting oneself acceptable when you canaffect the outcome In this situation however the man is already trapped andpresumably committed to child support and the woman is not about to undergo anintegrity makeover Prudie suggests you go to the gym to work off some of thisunderstandable hostility            Prudie athletically                                             DearPrudence                                                      Is it proper to make your bed in a hotel room atthe end of your stay More to the point is it considered impolite to not makethe bed                                       I was brought up to make the bed before leavingbut my friends say it is just more work for the maidwho has to strip thesheets anyway                                       Yourthoughts                                       Wondering in Mass                        Dear Won            You have slipped a stitch somewhere Making onesbed in a hotel is like whipping up your own souffle in a restaurant Otherpeople have been employed for just those purposes            You perhaps are confusing staying in a hotel withbeing a guest in someones home where it is good manners to make your bed Thewild card however is when your stay is over Prudie finds it useful andmannerly to ask the hosts how they wish the bed to be left Some people wantit stripped others left as is for their housekeepers to deal with            Prudie applauds yourthoughtfulness however and is sure you are one of those considerate peoplewho when ending a hotel stay leaves a tip for the maid            Prudie tidily                                             DearPrudence                                                      I have been in a relationship now for about twoyears with a most remarkable person He and I have been going through manygrowth and development phases We have realized that I am somewhat conventionaland that he is non The differences in our values are sometimes trivialsometimes important None of the differences however interfere with our trustor love The differences have to do with issues such as savingspending moneyindependence and socially expected behavior                                       How does one knowwhen you are giving expecting or hoping for too much Is there an answer tothis Thank you                                       Questioning                        Dear Quest            A lovely Zen quotation comes to mind There is nosolution seek it lovingly            Using the wordremarkable bodes well for your future together as does your understanding ofyour differences There are no guarantees of course about how differenceswill play out so all you can do is try to look ahead and imagine if you bothwill adopt the others ways carry on comfortably with distinct approaches orwind up killing each other            Prudie philosophically                                             DearPrudence                                                      How should young children address adults Mywife and I believe that Mr or Mrs or Ms are in order For very closefriends perhaps Aunt or Uncle Most of our yuppie friends have theirkids call my wife and me by our first names Not a big deal but we think thisis a bad example for our children What do you say                                       Sincerely                                       E in Toronto                        Dear E            As a rule children should address adults in themanner in which the adults ask to be addressed or alternatively in the way inwhich their own parents instruct them The real example for the children oughtto be what is comfortable and polite With luck they are the same thing Itsounds to Prudie as though you and your spouse are a little more formal thanthe times Perhaps you might take a social inventory of who is calling whomwhat in your circle and then make a standard ruling for your children Ifhowever you are seriously unhappy with youngsters calling their elders byfirst names no one could take affront with the Aunt or Mrs form ofaddress It might make your children stand out however            As you said not a bigdeal            Prudieconversationally
