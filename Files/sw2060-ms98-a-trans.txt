          okay   uh the topic is to discuss the uh sources where i receive news   uhhuh   and uh for me thats uh mostly newspaper and radio i almost never watch television as a matter of course so i dont get news from television except during the war i watched a lot of CNN because it was so good   uhhuh well why was CNN the only of course i think Saddam Hussein only allowed CNN to broadcast it is that not true   um   it was unusual not to have the different sources you know of news coverage   yeah um i dont know i guess uh i dont even know why i watch CNN i guess i just wanted more news its one of the few times i wanted   yeah well i know even if you watched ABC NBC or or the other you i mean whats the other one  uh CBS they all were were tapped into CNN   more news than CBS were they   uhhuh thats the only thing they broadcast and like you i listen to the radio on my job at work and all this week theyve been having this uh   yeah uhhuh   a discussion about that is why uh why CNN was well i listen to a Christian radio station and they were saying that CNN is definitely a world uh news service and uh     umhum   that  was you cant really be sure of the quality of what you got you know   hm   uh we had some uh some people from our church went to Israel uh just for a uh tour sort of thing   umhum   and i was watching on TV they they broadcast this terrible riot supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem so we got all fearful for our people come to find out they came back and said they werent even aware of it   right   and so it really made me question as to what how do we know about you know uh if the news were getting is any good so     yeah i guess the news just focuses on major events that probably   yeah   dont affect ninety nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made   right right   but uh i can im from California and i can remember being in uh in these earthquakes and i mean they were they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view and it seemed   yeah   you know from anyone elses point of view but theyd get all blown up in the news   uhhuh     uh   well i it i find it depressing to watch or especially TV you know its  uh local news concentrates on murders and things like that im from Dallas   umhum   and uh we have a lot of bad stuff it just really  gets me depressed even to watch it   umhum yeah   so then you wake up one morning and youre in war with somebody you dont even  know about it   right   so   oh what newspaper uh do you read in Dallas   uh we have the Dallas Times Herald and the Dallas Morning News but i dont i dont read newspapers   dont you how come   huhuh i have find it hard to uh follow from one page to another its just something ive never developed uh an interest in   huh   and i live in kind of a bad area where if i have the paper delivered its stolen before i can get out and get it   God thats uh that sounds pretty bad to me i mean who would steal a newspaper   youd be surprised   hm   they just come by and pick them up even if its just for the TV you know  uh selections of the day i dont know it just wouldnt be there whenever ive tried it   i see yeah   so  youre right who would steal a newspaper but they do   yeah   what part of California are you from   uh from Los Angeles but i live in Raleigh North Carolina right now thats where im speaking to you from   oh okay   but i grew up in LA i work out here   huh you work for TI   no i dont i work for North Carolina State University   huh   but uh i know some people at TI and i have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them so im in the computer business   yeah well i boy current events is not a good subject for me   well   i dont keep up with it that often   lets see ive ive ive never done this before i mean ive never   this is your first call   this is my first call because i just got my password   uhhuh oh really   so i dont know are we suppose to it seems to me it says youre supposed to talk for three minutes but i think weve been talking for three minutes and nobody has interrupted   yeah well id i got into a conversation last night with a lady and they interrupt at ten minutes   i see   so if weve done our three minutes lets just let the conversation end and say bye   nice talking to you too byebye   uhhuh well all right nice talking to you all right bye
