Russian press took a strongly antiWestern line on the issueBut the daily Sevodnya also mocked President Boris Yeltsin for devotingmore time to it than to Russias economic crisis Russians waited for a monthand a half for Yeltsin to explain the crisis and how the country should fightit the paper said Wednesday The president however remained in a state oflethargy Then when he finally woke up he immediately started making phonecalls to world leaders about Kosovo because this gave him a chance to feelhimself a leader of a great power On Russias pledge to veto any UNresolution authorizing force against Yugoslavia Sevodnya describedRussias position as ambiguous because it is both threatening the West andbegging it for money at the same time                           Izvestiya said the use of force against Yugoslavia would revive the ColdWar NezavisimayaGazeta said there is a possibility Russia will send troops into the Balkansin extreme circumstances Back in February  when NATO threatened to bombthe Bosnian Serbs it was the appearance of Russian peacekeepers in the regionthat prevented the attack it explained It added that by constantly puttingpressure on only one side in the conflictthe Serbsthe West was encouragingAlbanian terrorism The general assumption that Milosevic is bad and Albaniansare good still dominates Western politics it concluded            In an editorial Thursday the Times of London decried thechaos afflicting international diplomacy over Kosovo with meetings scheduledand cancelled within hours statements issued and promptly retracted statesmenannouncing their arrival in capitals unprepared to greet them and leaderstrying to keep telephone track of the Balkan imbroglio while locked intocampaigns and duties thousands of miles away Attempts to base every decisionon consensus had created a multinational muddle while Slobodan Miloseviclaughs a little longer it concluded            OnRussias own crisis Komsomolskaya Pravda said Yeltsin was being sheltered fromreality by his Kremlin advisers who sent him reports making his reforms appearsuccessful and life in Russia happier than it was But it praised him forhaving at least restored free speech to a country that had been deprived of itfor centuries No one in Yeltsins time has ever been persecuted for makingantiRussian statements it said            Novye Izvestiya ran an interview Wednesday with theAmerican economist Geoffrey Saks an adviser to the Russian government in whom it quoted as saying that corruption and misappropriation of Westerncredits have created a situation in Russia to which no one sees a solutionSaks said that between  billion and  billion in Western aid was takenout of the country and either deposited in Western banks or used to buyproperty abroad Saks added that when he spoke to the White House and the StateDepartment about this scandal he was met only with silence even though inprivate talks US officials admitted the West had given money to Russia notfor economic but for political purposes            In ParisLe Monde reportedThursday on its front page that the mayor has ordered the establishment of a square meter vegetable garden in the old quarter of Le Marais as a memorialto Princess Diana It is designed to be a center of initiation to nature forchildren the paper said The proposal angered neighborhood leaders andprovoked some acid comments in British newspapers which pointed out that Dianahad no interest in gardening and that she couldnt even cook But the LondonEvening Standard hopes the proposal will undermine a deeplycontroversial plan supported by the British government for a memorial garden toher to be created in Kensington Gardens in London
