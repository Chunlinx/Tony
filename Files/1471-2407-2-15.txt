                    Background        Phosphatidylinositoltrisphosphate PIP is one        of the major intracellular second messengers regulating        growth metabolism and vesicular trafficking for reviews        see refs       The level of PIP in the cell is        determined by the balance of kinase and phosphatase        activity PIKinase activity is acutely regulated and a        number of isoforms have been cloned that are activated in        response to various stimuli     The major        phosphatidylinositolphosphate phosphatase in cells is        the tumor suppressor PTEN      This protein has a        tonic inhibitory effect on PIKinase signaling by        reversing the phosphorylation PTEN is altered or        deleted in many human cancers        Invitro        cells that are deficient in PTEN show elevated PIKinase        signaling     Reintroduction of PTEN in a variety of        cancer cells including glioma breast bladder and ovarian        cancer cells causes G arrest inhibits tumorigenesis and        promotes anoikis       Mechanistically Akt        activity is decreased cell motility is decreased        expression of two cyclindependent kinase inhibitors p        and p is increased cyclin D is downregulated Rb        phosphorylation is inhibited and signaling via GrbSOS is        suppressed      The link between PTEN and cell        growth is underscored by genetic experiments in mice PTEN        knockout mice die inutero due to extensive overgrowth of        the cephalic and caudal regions      PTEN         heterozygous mice have a predisposition to tumors in        multiple tissues often with loss of the second allele             Invitro PTEN embryonic stem cells and        fibroblasts display increased proliferation and decreased        sensitivity to apoptosis        The PIKinasedependent activation of Akt is thought to        play a central role in the cell survival pathway in many        cells       Elevated Akt activity and protein is        found in many PTENdeficient cancer cells Akt directly        phosphorylates and inactivates the proapoptotic proteins        ASK BAD caspase         Akt also induces the        expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl and cFLIP proteins        and suppresses the cell cycle inhibitor p KIP               This later effect is via the phosphorylation and        inactivation of the forkhead family of transcription        factors AFX FKHR and FKHRL Although it is often assumed        that elevated Akt activity is responsible for the increased        survival of cancer cells Akt activity is not the only        pathway that is essential for cell survival The MAPK        pathway can also protect cells from apoptosis as can        constitutive activation of Stat signaling             The IGFI Receptor is a member of the large family of        tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors Signaling by the        IGFIR has been studied in many different cell types and is        important for proliferation survival motility adhesion        transformation tumor formation and metastasis for reviews        see refs      The receptor can directly        phosphorylate the insulin receptor substrate  IRS and        Shc proteins in the intact cell causing activation of        PIKinase and ras signaling     More recently it has        been shown that the IGFIR signals via the G subunits of        the heterotrimeric Gi complex to stimulate PIKinase and        ras and also activates the JAKStat pathway to cause        phosphorylation of Stat             What is the evidence for the involvement of IGFIR        signaling in proliferation and cancer Elegant studies in        knockout mice have delineated the contribution of IGFI        IGFII and the IGFI receptor to fetal growth for review        see ref     Embryonic fibroblasts derived from IGFIR        knockout embryos Rcells do not grow in serumfree        medium despite supplementation with a wide variety of        other growth factors and grow more slowly in media        containing serum than wildtype cells for reviews see refs             Additionally all phases of the cell cycle are        prolonged in the null cells suggesting that the IGFIR is        required throughout the cell cycle A functional IGFI        receptor is required for successful cell transformation        IGFIR cells are not transformed by overexpression of        SV T antigen activated         ras  or EGF or PDGF receptors        Transformation appears to involve autocrine stimulation as        IGFI production and secretion is increased in normal cells        following transformation by SV T antigen but the null        cells cannot respond to the IGFI so do not transform        Interfering with the IGF signaling system can inhibit        the growth of cancer cells invitro and invivo Treatment        with antagonistic peptide analogs of IGFI antisense        oligos or an adenovirus expressing IGFIR antisense cRNA        prevents proliferation of cells in monolayers        transformation and growth in athymic nude mice This        includes multiple human tumor cell lines including        glioblastoma melanoma ovarian carcinoma prostatic        carcinoma and breast carcinomas for reviews see refs                  The IGFIR appears to function in        transformation both by preventing apoptosis through        activation of Akt and by stimulating proliferation through        the rasMAPK cascade IGFI can prevent         cmyc induced apoptosis in ratl        fibroblasts and neuronal apoptosis due to        serumstarvation IGFIR cells can proliferate in        monolayers in the presence of serum but undergo apoptosis        when put in suspension and are more sensitive to        chemotherapeutic reagents There is also evidence        implicating the IGFIR in metastasis IGFI produces a        chemotactic response in human melanoma cells and antisense        to the IGFIR mRNA prevents metastasis in the murine        carcinoma cell H        In this study we wanted to determine if disruption of        IGFI signaling could prevent growth of a tumor cell        lacking PTEN Elevated PIKinase can be normalized by        reintroduction of PTEN to reduce PIP levels but it has        not been shown that this effect can also be achieved by        disruption of an upstream signal that stimulates PIKinase        activity We have previously demonstrated the        overexpression and hormoneindependent activation of the        IGFIR in primary breast cancers     Similar        overexpression of the IGFIR and the ligands IGFI and        IGFII have been seen in human gliomas and astrocytomas               Because of the important role for the        IGFIR in cell survival we investigated whether a dominant        negative IGFIR could inhibit growth of the U glioma        This glioma is deficient in PTEN and shows constitutive        activation of Akt which can be inactivated by        reintroduction of PTEN                        Materials and Methods                  Materials and Cell Culture          Antiphosphotyrosine antibodies pY were from

washed with icecold          phosphatebuffered saline and solubilized in            SDSsample buffer containing  mM sodium orthovanadate          and  mM sodium fluoride The proteins were denatured

methionine substitution for lysine  in          the ATPbinding site of the kinase domain were cloned          into the retroviral vector pLPONL     The          pseudotyped viruses were generated and purified by the          UCSD Viral Vector Core The plasmids were cotransfected          into  cells with an expression vector for the          Vesicular Stomatitis VirusG protein This coat protein          allows the virus to be concentrated and confers greater          tropism Cell culture supernatants and cells were          harvested and the virus concentrated Viruses were          titered on NIHT cells and the number of G resistant          colonies counted A control virus containing the E coli          galactosidase gene was obtained from the Viral Vector          Core                          Growth in Soft Agar          Cells were trypsinized and  cells plated in  mm          petri dishes in complete medium containing  agarose          over a layer of  agarose in complete medium Cells          were allowed to grow for  days or until colonies          were  m in diameter Fresh medium was layered          above the agarose every  days Colonies were stained          with Crystal Violet and counted                          Tumor Growth in Athymic Nude Mice          Housing and all procedures using nude mice were          approved by the animal care committee at UCSD The cells          for injection were trypsinized in sterile PBS pelleted          by centrifugation at   g for  min and washed twice          in sterile saline Cells were resuspended in  l          sterile saline and counted using a hemacytometer The          appropriate number of cells was diluted into  l          sterile saline and then added to an equal volume of          sterile Matrigel on ice This suspension was injected          subcutaneously on the rear flank of athymic nude mice          using a sterile syringe and gauge needle Mice were          observed on a twiceweekly basis to check for tumor          growth Tumors were measured with calipers in three          dimensions and tumor volume calculated assuming the          tumors were ellipsoid At the end of the study the          tumors were excised measured weighed and then fixed in           formalin Tumors were embedded in paraffin sectioned          and stained with hematoxylineosin or for apoptosis using          the TUNEL assay Roche Indianapolis IN                            Results and Discussion                  Inhibition of the IGFI receptor by expression of a          kinase inactive mutant inhibits proliferation of Chinese          hamster ovary CHO cells          Before embarking on studies in human tumor cells we          verified that our dominant negative approach would work          in a model system To inhibit the IGFIR we took          advantage of the fact that the IGFI receptor is a          heterotetramer Activation of the native receptor          requires the transphosphorylation of two kinase domains              Hence expression of an excess of          kinasedefective IGFI receptors causes the formation of          hybrid molecules containing one half an endogenous          wildtype receptor and the other half a kinasedefective          transfected receptor These hybrids should be kinase          inactive and signaling incompetent Similar approaches          have been used successfully in other studies                          Initially we tested Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells          that had been stably transfected with expression vectors          for kinaseinactive or wild type IGFI receptors              The parental CHO cell line expresses  endogenous          IGFIRs the transfected wildtype CHOWT cell line          expresses  IGFIRs and the kinasedefective          CHOMK cell line expresses  mutant IGFIRs          Thus the transfected cells express the human IGFIR at          approximately five fold higher levels than the endogenous          receptor The mutant receptor contains a lysine to          methionine MK point mutation at position  in the          ATP binding site of the kinase domain and has no          measurable kinase activity Two clonal lines expressing          the MK receptor were used with identical results          We assessed the ability of the IGFIRs of each cell          line to undergo autophosphorylation in response to          increasing concentrations of IGFI Cells were stimulated          with increasing concentrations of IGFI and whole cell          lysates immunoblotted for tyrosinephosphorylated          proteins As expected autophosphorylation of the IGFIRs          was observed in the CHO and CHOWT cells but very little          was seen in two different clones of CHOMK cells          indicating that the kinasedefective receptors inhibited          the endogenous wildtype hamster receptors Figure A          The inhibition was not complete however as          phosphorylation of IRS the major endogenous substrate          in these cells is still preserved at the higher dose of          IGFI but inhibited at the lower dose This is likely due          to the level of receptor expression The transfected          receptors are expressed at four fold the level of the          endogenous receptors Assuming stochastic assembly of          tetramers  of receptors should be homodimers of          signaling competent receptors that can phosphorylate          IRS To confirm that the kinasedefective receptors were          functioning in a dominantnegative fashion we studied          the ability of CHO and CHOMK cells to incorporate          Hthymidine into DNA in response to IGFI stimulation          Serumstarved cells were stimulated with increasing          concentrations if IGFI and then pulsed with          Hthymidine The ability of the CHOMK cells to          incorporate thymidine in response to IGFI is markedly          diminished as compared to the parental cell line Figure          B          We then tested colony formation in soft agar as an          indicator of cellular transformation Cells were          trypsinized counted and equivalent numbers of cells          plated in soft agar in complete medium Cells were          cultured for    days and then the number of colonies          counted Overexpression of the wildtype IGFIRs          increased the number of colonies and overexpressing the          kinasedefective receptors reduced the number of colonies          by  Figure C Not only did we observe a difference          of the number of colonies but CHOMK colonies were          smaller than either the parental CHO or CHOWT colonies          data not shown          We next studied the ability of each of these cell          lines to form tumors in athymic nude mice Ten million            cells from each cell line were injected          subcutaneously into the flanks of five athymic nude mice          Tumor size was measured biweekly The mice were          euthanized at the end of three weeks and the tumors          excised and weighed Figure D E At this high          level of innoculum there was no difference in tumor          incidence data not shown However expression of the          wildtype IGFIR accelerated tumor growth and tumors were          larger at sacrifice The kinase defective IGFIR on the          other hand delayed the appearance of tumors and smaller          tumors were found at sacrifice          The tumors were imbedded in paraffin and sections were          stained with hematoxylin and eosin Figure  left          panels The sections were also stained for the presence          of apoptosis using the TUNEL method Apoptotic cells          image as fluorescent green Figure  right panels The          typical histology of CHO tumors is shown in panel A          Cells transfected with the wildtype IGFIR have a more          streaming morphology characteristic of human ovarian          tumors Panel B Cells transfected with the          kinasedefective IGFIR showed a more benign morphology          with no invasion of the capsule Panel C and data not          shown Very few apoptotic cells are seen in the CHO          parental and CHOWT cells whereas apoptotic cells are          seen throughout the tumor from the kinasedefective          CHOMK cells These results confirm that the kinase          defective IGFIR is able to inhibit tumor growth in a          model system                          An inhibitory antibody to the IGFIR inhibits          growth of U tumors          Adenoviral expression of wildtype PTEN can inhibit          U tumor growth indicating that elevated PIKinase          signaling is responsible for the increased proliferation          and survival of these cells      Our subsequent          studies were designed to test whether interruption of an          upstream growth factor signal would have the same growth          inhibitory effect as reintroduction of PTEN To test          initially whether the PTENdeficient U glioma cells          might be susceptible to inhibition of the IGFIR we          measured colony formation and tumor growth in the          presence of an inhibitory antibody to the human IGFIR          IR This antibody prevents binding of IGFI or IGFII          to the extracellular domain of the IGFIR and has been          shown to prevent the formation of MDA tumors in nude          mice     U cells were plated in soft agar in the          presence of IR or a control antibody Cells were          cultured for  days and the number of colonies counted          The presence of the inhibitory antibody reduced the          number of colonies growing in soft agar but the control          antibody had no effect Table  U cells were then          injected into nude mice as before Mice received biweekly          intraperitoneal injections of  g of IR or control          antibody starting  days after injection of the cells          The IR injections reduced the number of tumors by           Table  The tumors were excised fixed and          stained for apoptosis Tumors from mice treated with the          IR antibody showed extensive apoptosis unlike control          tumors Figure  These results confirm that inhibition          of IGFI signaling by an inhibitory antibody can suppress          growth of a PTENdeficient glioma cell line                          Retroviral expression of the kinase inactive IGFI          Receptor inhibits growth of U glioblastoma cells          invivo          To make expression of kinase defective IGFI receptors          in different cell lines more tractable we generated          pseudotyped retroviruses expressing either the          kinasedefective MK or wildtype WT IGFI receptors          We also obtained a virus expressing the          betagalactosidase LacZ protein to measure infection          efficiency and serve as a virus control U cells were          infected with the MK WT or LacZ viruses and selected          with G Pools of cells containing stably integrated          retroviruses were then used in transformation and tumor          growth experiments Binding studies showed that the          ULacZ cells express  endogenous IGFIRs per cell          while the UWT and UMK cells express    and             receptors per cells respectively Thus the          retrovirus allows  to fold overexpression of the          transfected receptor          To test the function of the virally encoded receptors          we measured IGFI stimulated autophosphorylation of the          IGFIR and phosphorylation of IRS Phosphorylation          IRS was evident in the LacZ infected cells but little          IGFIR phosphorylation was seen as the cells express few          receptors Figure  Infection with the WT virus leads          to a large increase in IGFIR and IRS tyrosine          phosphorylation Infection with the MK virus eliminated          the IGFI stimulated phosphorylation of IRS confirming          that the expressed receptor was acting as a dominant          negative to inhibit the endogenous receptors The          dominant negative effect is much greater in these cells          than the CHO cells Figure  as the virus expresses the          transfected receptors at a much higher level          The three infected U glioma cells were then injected          into nude mice Eight to twelve mice were studied for          each cell line and each mouse received two injections In          two different experiments mice were inoculated with           or    cells Tumors were excised after  or           weeks and weighed Table  The WTinfected cells had          the highest frequency of tumor formation and the          MKinfected cells the lowest in both cases WTinfected          cells gave the largest tumors in both experiments          demonstrating that overexpression of the IGFIR in a          malignant cell can enhance tumor formation as we observed          for the CHO cells The MKinfected cells gave fewer          tumors in both experiments but more importantly those          tumors that did form were much smaller The results          obtained with the dominant negative IGFIR are identical          to published results reintroducing PTEN hence          inhibition of upstream PIKinase signaling might be a          useful approach for PTENdeficient tumors          The tumors were imbedded in paraffin and sections were          stained with hematoxylin and eosin Figure  The          ULacZ tumors are very cellular with small regular          nuclei left panel and show some invasion of the capsule          by tumor cells right panel The tumors from U cells          infected with the IGFIR virus are also very cellular          but the cells have larger nuclei left panel and have          completely invaded the capsule right panel The tumors          from U cells infected with the kinase inactive IGFIR          are less cellular with larger areas of stroma left          panel Numerous irregular nuclei are apparent There is          no invasion of the capsule by tumor cells right panel          The irregular nuclei and intact capsule are consistent          with data from other cells showing that inhibition of          IGFIR expression causes apoptosis and prevents          metastasis          The idea that the IGFIR might be a valuable target          for the treatment of brain tumors is supported by a          recent pilot study in twelve patients with malignant          astrocytomas     All patients had grade  or           astrocytomas and had failed on standard therapy The PTEN          status of their primary tumors was not known After          surgery autologous glioma cells were collected and          treated exvivo with IGFIR antisense oligos and          reimplanted in diffusion chambers for  h Clinical and          radiological improvements were seen in eight of the          twelve patients Five patients showed a lymphocytic          infiltration after antisense treatment indicating that          knocking out the IGFIR induced an immune response It          would be interesting to determine whether response to          this treatment correlated with loss of PTEN in the          primary tumors                            Conclusions        Loss of PTEN is a very common occurrence in human        tumors Restoring PTEN protein or function to reduce        PIKinase signaling prevents tumor growth in animal        models However it may not be possible to restore PTEN in        human tumors Direct inhibition of PIKinase activity may        not be feasible either as it is likely to have severe side        effects Our results suggest that a therapeutic strategy to        inhibit the upstream stimulus for PIKinase through        blockade of growth factor receptors may provide a workable        alternative                    Abbreviations        PIP Phosphatidyltriphosphate DMEM Dulbeccos        Modified Eagles Medium PIKinase        phosphatidylinositolkinase MAPK
