workers contributions to theirinsurance coverage dropped in the past year The top nonlocal story at theLos AngelesTimes is one that led the NYT yesterday the Surgeon Generalsreport regarding the surprising prevalence of mental disorders in the US andthe alarmingly low rate of treatment            The NYT leads headline emphasizes the closeness of the Israeliparliament vote which the paper says is far from the strong victory Barakexpected while the WP s stresses that Barak is making it clear to hisCabinet and the parliament that he is willing to cede the Golan Heights back toSyria in return for security guarantees The Post says that thediplomatic development has provoked shouting matches shock and hope amongIsraelis as well as a  percent rise in the Tel Aviv stock market The

opposition may bring inAmerican political consultants for the campaign over that            The WP offleads Al Gores pronouncementprompted by the publicitysurrounding that conviction of an Army man for murdering a gay fellowsoldierthat the Clinton administrations dont ask dont tell policyshould be abandoned The paper calls this Gores sharpest public break yetwith President Clintons policies and says that it represents a change from theposition Gore had been taking as recently as this past weekend Gore aidesdiffer saying that the VP is just now reiterating a stand hes taken insidethe White House The WP says the Bill Bradley campaign noted that withhis shift Gore has just arrived at the position Bradley has been espousing formonths The paper also reminds that this controversy underscores the importanceof the gay vote in Democratic politics but could cause difficulties forDemocrats in the general election            Gores statement comes as the Secretary of Defense ordered a Pentagoninvestigation to determine whether homosexuals in uniform are being harassedThe NYT fronts that investigation and Gores stance as does USAT The investigation raises a question that is only lightly touched on by thepapers How can it work without violating the current policy wholesale Afterall an investigator cant ask soldiers if they are being harassed for beinggay without in effect asking them if theyre gay and a soldier cant tell aninvestigator that he is being harassed for being gay without telling theinvestigator that he is gay            A NYT inside story reports that Great Britain has decided to abandonits proscription of homosexuals in the service in favor of a policy that willban all onduty sex but not care about sexual orientation            The fronts at the LAT

presidential official residence The story is based on areport coming out today from the Center for Public Integrity Gifts include abilliard table a hot tub and landscaping Donors include individuals notsubject to the usual  limit because the money at issue was spent on AlGores house not Al Gore such as Bill Gates Hollywood producer KathleenKennedy and a tobacco exec Corporate donors include Atlantic Richfield MCIWorldcom and Microsoft The story doesnt mention it but all three of thesecompanies have issues of tremendous financial consequence currently beingconsidered by the federal government            The WP front serves up the latebreaking bulletin that online chathas bred a new cluster of acronyms such as IMHO and LOL And the paper wasfortunately able to get a minute with Robert Kraut of Carnegie MellonUniversity to get his explanation that its very natural for human beings toshorten words Kraut by the way or so the Post informs is professorof social psychology and humancomputer interaction there Wheres an acronymwhen you really need one
