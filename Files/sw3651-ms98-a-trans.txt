        okay i guess tonights subject is uh woodworking do you uh     what kind of woodworking do you do   well kind kind of mainly the woodworking ive done lately is uh  made like uh for example a little nativity scene um   uhhuh   not the uh the whole figurines and so forth but mainly the stable put some shelves in and and some odd stuff around the house and so i i enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking and i do it out of hobby more than uh um you know something i have to do how about yourself   uh well well it yeah i like to think of it as a hobby but i i guess also partly out of necessity just repairing things around the house       um a few years ago uh we we needed uh they needed some book shelves and i kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves and um uh it it actually worked pretty well and over the years ive ive refined those plans i got myself a router and im im very good at making book shelves   uhhuh   it its also a way of relieving stress my wife kind of laughs at me that anytime i get stressed i just go out in the garage and weve got more book shelves  but     well ill have to come and see them that sounds like a good idea i you know and thats that is right it is out of necessity because a lot of the things that uh well we cant be able to afford but also i i sometimes sometimes think that uh i enjoy doing that and i like to get out and and uh to work with my hands and uh sounds like you got some real nice tools too do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools   uh  well yeah i mean little by little i i started out with just basic hand tools and kind of added on to things uh   umhum   gotten a a good belt sander and and the router uh helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router   umhum   the latest project that ive been working on and and this has kind of been sitting here for a few months is a a cabinet to to put a TV in   oh a entertainment type center oh   right and it thats works well because you can design it to to suit whatever equipments you have   right   so i designed a space just the right size for the TV and then the the the VCR and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment and uh   right right   thats worked pretty well uh  with uh with the router you can make nice uh  i guess dado joints is what its called   right or yes i yeah im aware of that   um and its uh   and also with a router you can uh make ornamental facings too better than a just straight wood edge and uh   thats right thats right   and uh   so   casings and so forth that are that are real nice so that thats good thats good   what i what i need next is a good table saw and i i debate whether it the better if you get a uh   yeah   just a straight table saw or to get one of these uh rotary arm saws radial arm saws i guess what theyre called   oh uhhuh   um it it seems to me the radial arm saws is better well it it takes up less room i mean you you set the wood down and you move the saw whereas if youre ripping wood youre probably better off with a a table saw   yes yes well and with a radial arm saw if you do have a a big piece of wood that you need to rip like you say or cut you wouldnt be able to do that um but uh yeah a table saw does take a lot of time excuse me a lot of space and is a pretty big investment and uh   yeah uh that thats partly my problem now is i dont have room for this i uh a were uh where we lived before up north uh basements were were common and i couldve put all this stuff in my basement but not so here in Texas   uhhuh yes uhhuh no they dont have basements well im from up north also and and uh no theres no  basements down here and its kind of uh hard to get uh shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that   yeah   yeah lot of the equipment too that ive ive used in the past uh i would you know ive used in school and uh i would i dont know id id kind of like to to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say a table saw and some of those things that would make uh some pretty nice uh pieces of uh well wood for for different things for tables for for or um chairs for you know decks and so forth so   umhum   i dont know i i just enjoy woodworking and i think the the main thing is like you say its a its a good out its an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day and its a great strase stress reliever   have you ever used a lathe   yes i have in school i have and ive made uh uh different things uh lathe type tables for chairs and ive made uh bowls and um and uh
