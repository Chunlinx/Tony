                    Introduction        With the increasing worldwide availability of liver        transplantation a standardized assessment of severity of        illness is needed to evaluate patient outcome objectively        over time and between different institutions        Cirrhosisspecific scoring systems such as the ChildPugh        classification and Shows risk score have been shown to be        good predictors of outcome of cirrhotic patients          However when used as predictors of outcome for liver        transplantation patients the results are inconsistent            This is partly explained by the fact that the        preoperative condition is only one factor in a series of        complex interactions that include intraoperative and        postoperative factors Systems for predicting the severity        of illness and mortality such as the Acute Physiology and        Chronic Health Evaluation APACHE II system are        attractive options for this group because they rely on data        collected soon after admission to the intensive care unit        ICU which is likely to reflect preoperative        intraoperative and postoperative contributions        The APACHE II system was described by Knaus         et al in  to predict hospital        mortality in ICU patients   The multiple logistic        regression equations were based on data collected on         medical and surgical patients admitted to the ICU in         tertiary medical centers in the USA This outcome        prediction system has been used to evaluate and compare the        performance of ICUs in different hospitals and countries        In addition to general ICU patients APACHE II has also        been studied in specific groups of patients such as those        with trauma   sepsis   and cirrhosis          The APACHE II prediction equation incorporates three        variables an APACHE II score the diagnostic category of        the patient and whether the surgery was emergency or        elective The APACHE II score consists of the Acute        Physiology Score which is calculated from  physiologic        variables that are scored from  to  and depend upon the        degree of deviation from normal Points for age and for        chronic illness are also assigned There are  different        diagnostic categories each with a different weight used in        calculating the predicted mortality There is no specific        diagnostic category weight for liver transplantation        because there were no liver transplantation patients in the        developmental database for this system Thus when this        system is used for postoperative liver transplantation        patients the diagnostic category weight postoperative        other gastrointestinal surgery is used This approach has        been shown to overestimate mortality significantly          Angus         et al recently derived a new        diagnostic category weight based on their population of        liver transplantation patients   The purpose of the        study was to validate the newly derived postoperative        orthotopic liver transplantation OLTXspecific diagnostic        weight for APACHE II in independent databases                    Methods        King Fahad National Guard Hospital KFNGH is a bed        tertiary care center The bed medicalsurgical ICU has         admissions per year The liver transplantation program        is the main program in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia The        University of Wisconsin UW liver transplantation program        is a major program in the USA Liver transplantation        patients are admitted to the Trauma and Life Support        Center which is a multidisciplinary ICU that admits         patients per year Medical records of liver transplantation        patients admitted postoperatively to the adult ICU in the        period April  to January  at KFNGH and April         to January  at UW were reviewed Retransplantations        kidneyliver and livingrelated transplantations were        excluded The following data were collected age sex and        underlying liver disease APACHE II scores were calculated        according to the original methodology by using the worst        physiologic values in the first ICU day The only exception        was Glasgow Coma Score GCS Most of these patients were        still under the influence of postoperative sedation during        the first  hours in ICU and the worst GCS would reflect        the effect of sedation more than the true underlying mental        status We therefore used the best GCS which we felt would        be a better reflection of the patients mental status All        patients were given chronic health points Vital status at        discharge from the hospital was registered        Predicted mortality was calculated with the logistic        regression formula described in the original article          We used two approaches the original APACHE II diagnostic        category weight of postoperative gastrointestinal surgery         and the OLTXspecific diagnostic category weight        calculated by Angus         et al    The formulae        for calculating predicted mortality risk of death ROD        are as follows        for the original approach ln ROD  ROD           APACHE II score            for the new approach ln ROD  ROD           APACHE II score            Standardized mortality ratio SMR was calculated by        dividing observed mortality by the predicted mortality The         confidence intervals CIs for SMRs were calculated by        regarding the observed mortality as a Poisson variable        then dividing its  CI by the predicted mortality          The two approaches were compared with regard to calibration        the ability to provide a risk estimate corresponding to        the observed mortality and discrimination the ability of        the predictive system to differentiate survivors from        nonsurvivors The calibration of both systems was        evaluated with the HosmerLemeshow goodnessoffit         C statistic   We calculated the                C statistic by dividing the study        population into six equal groups with increasing predicted        mortality to ensure an adequate number of patients in each        group Discrimination was tested by    classification        matrices at decision criteria of   and         Receiver operating characteristic ROC curves were        constructed as a measure of assessing discrimination with         stepwise increments in predicted mortality The two        curves were compared by computing the areas under the ROC        curves           The patient characteristics and outcome data from the        two participating institutions were compared to evaluate        the overall performance of the system between the two        hospitals Continuous variables were expressed as means         SD Categorical values were expressed in absolute and        relative frequencies All categorical variables were        analyzed by the  test Nonparametric variables were        compared by KruskalWallis test         P values of  or less were        considered significant Minitab for Windows Release         Minitab Inc was used for statistical analysis                    Results                  Patient characteristics          During

institutions Patients from KFNGH were          slightly but significantly younger than patients at UW          Hepatitis C virus was more common and alcoholrelated          liver disease was less common as an underlying disease          in patients in KFNGH than in those at UW APACHE II          scores and correspondingly predicted mortalities were          higher in KFNGH patients Despite these differences the          performances of the prediction systems the old and the          new models were quite similar in the two hospitals as          reflected by SMRs The new approach provided more          accurate estimates of hospital mortality in each hospital          than the old model                            Discussion        The findings of our study can be summarized as follows        APACHE II with its original diagnostic category weight        overestimated hospital mortality in postoperative liver        transplantation patients  when the newly derived        OLTXspecific diagnostic category weight was applied        mortality prediction discrimination and calibration of        APACHE II improved despite differences in the patient        populations the performance of the old and new models as        reflected by SMRs was similar in the two institutions        The literature evaluating APACHE II in postoperative        liver transplantation patients is limited Bein         et al   reviewed the use of        scoring systems in  liver transplantation patients In        their study APACHE II scores were reported however no        calculation of the predicted mortality was performed The        study showed that APACHE II scores had good discrimination        as reflected by the areas under the curves of the ROC        curves A second study by Sawyer         et al   found that mortality        correlated with the APACHE II score However the predicted        mortality was again not calculated        Angus         et al   recently calculated the        predicted mortality for postoperative liver transplantation        patients and found that APACHE II system overestimated        mortality when the original equation was used SMR          CI  This is consistent with our findings        The inaccuracy of APACHE II with its original equation        probably arises from several factors The developmental        database of APACHE II did not have liver transplantation        patients the use of the system with the original equation        for liver transplantation patients therefore essentially        assumes that the weighted diagnostic category for liver        transplantation would be the same as for postoperative        gastrointestinal surgery In this study we show as shown        previously by Angus         et al   that this assumption is        not accurate because it leads to a significant        overestimation of mortality        We believe that the reason is related to the unique        pathophysiology of the period after liver transplantation        Marked changes occur during the procedure especially at        the time of reperfusion    These include a        significant decrease in blood pressure a decrease in        systemic vascular resistance an increase in cardiac        output a decrease in pH an increase in lactate an        increase in potassium and a prolongation of prothrombin        time    Although some of these abnormalities start        to normalize during the final stages of surgery some will        persist into to the immediate postoperative period          and will be reflected on any severity of illness score such        as APACHE II These changes start to normalize rapidly as        the graft starts to function The multitude of the        abnormalities and the speed with which they are corrected        make this group of patients unique and explains the        inaccuracy of APACHE II when using the diagnostic category        weight of postoperative gastrointestinal surgery        On the basis of the above it is not surprising that a        model developed on a population of liver transplant        patients would provide more accurate and reproducible        estimates Similar diseasespecific customizations of        mortality prediction systems have been performed such as        for sepsis          There are several obvious advantages to the use of        APACHE II as a model of severity of illness for liver        transplant patients These include the familiarity with the        system and its widespread use in ICUs ICUs that use APACHE        II as their database severity of illness scoring system        will find it easy to apply the system to this subgroup of        patients rather than implementing a special        diseasespecific system exclusively for OLTX patients In        general using a system for scoring the severity of illness        is essential for monitoring transplant program performance        over time and between different institutions Such a system        also can be useful for grouping patients in clinical        studies        In conclusion APACHE II provided an accurate estimate        of mortality in liver transplant patients when the        OLTXspecific diagnostic category weight was used                    Key messages         APACHE II with its original diagnostic category weight
