drug addiction It was anoddly appropriate subject because Moyers shows themselves are a kind ofaddictive drug After watching a Moyers documentary you are likely to beforno rational reasonin a warmhearted benevolent slightly euphoric mood Ifeel better for having watched this  Moyers is a glass of chardonnay beforedinner a small toke on a marijuana joint            Its easyenough to mock Moyers Americas secular televangelist He is after all theperson who gave America the mythmeister Joseph Campbell the mens movementguru Robert Bly and the oppression poet Maya Angelou now Bill would youplease take them back Moyers is capable of turning almost any subjectinto liberal squish In his hands the book of Genesis is a story of familydysfunction  Genesis A Living Conversation  and drug addiction is adisease for which addicts bear no responsibility            Moyers is terminally earnest and more cynical journaliststhat is all of us tire of his lectures on our frivolity An ordained Baptistminister he adores sermonizing about his seriousness of purpose Click forsome examples His TV manner can be unbearably ingratiating He does notaddress his audience as much as hypnotize it His gestures are too soothingclick to view my favorite His Texas drawl and folksy eloquence areoverpoweringlike drinking a gallon of sweet warm cream            Moyersalso gets hit for making money off public television Foundations andcorporations give him millions to produce documentaries He brilliantly marketsforprofit spinoffs His companion books for the Campbell Genesis poetry andmindbody medicine series have all been best sellers Its hard to see whatsso offensive about this commercialization Why shouldnt Moyers make a fortuneoff his books and videotapes Just because hes on PBS doesnt mean he shouldbe a monk            Moyers smug piety does not diminish his veryreal achievement He has spent his life trying to bring moral seriousness totelevision When Moyers quit as Lyndon B Johnsons press secretary he couldhave made a fortune anywhere Compare him with fellow LBJ confidante JackValenti who has been buckraking and powerplaying for  years But Moyersbelieved he would best serve the public as a TV educator a teacher in what hecalls the biggest classroom in America            To that end he spends hoursdocumenting political artistic and spiritual subjects that other TV newsdismisses in minutes He tackles big issuesthe worlds great religions evilpoetryand often explains them eloquently He has done more than anyone ontelevision to popularize littleknown scholars Yes that includes Campbellbut for every interview with someone like him there is one with a MortimerAdler the philosopher who used Moyers show to try to explain Aristotle            Conservative critics have complained that Moyers is pernicious because he isfaux high culture Moyers offers the simulacrum of knowledge When people watchAdler explain Aristotle they are being diverted from real thought They arewatching television rather than actually reading philosophy This seems to mean ungracious snipe The time spent watching Adler probably would have beenspent mooing over Ally McBeal  not studying Aristotle            Moyers political documentaries too address difficultissues clearly if onesidedly Liberals cite his IranContra TV essay as amodel for great television Documentaries on the CIA the rise of religiousfundamentalism and the minimum wage are much admired too And for all histendencies to liberal hackdom Moyers did make The Vanishing Family TheCrisis in Black America in  It linked black family decline to badsocial welfare policy years before most Democrats acknowledged the issueMoyers incidentally is one of the cultures best Zeitgeistindicators Click to read more            Moyersgrand publicspirited ambitions do often fail Many of his broadcasts duringthe Reagan and Bush years reflexively reinforced liberal nostrums Some of hisrecent spiritual documentaries have degenerated into New Age banalities But atleast he keeps trying And whether or not a documentary succeeds Moyers alwaysserves as a tonic to televisions mad rush Moyers documentaries arelanguorous even soporific But his long unhurried interviews crack hissubjects wide open They talk to the camera as they would with an old friendTheir frankness is a tribute to Moyers genuine warmth and empathy LessonThe thoughtful chingrab works            Which brings us to Moyers one realshortcoming He rejects confrontation He opens people up by agreeing withthem Moyers was an aide to the most political and confrontational ofpresidents but he is the world champion of consensus the patron saint in thechurch of Deborah Tannen Moyers gathers the faithful His shows are more Club than Crossfire  His guests almost always share Moyersbelief about the topic at hand If you watched the addiction series forexample you heard little about other popular views of addiction eg thataddicts should be forced to take responsibility for their actions not coddledinto victimization            Moyerskind of journalism seems designed to place this thought in the viewers mindNo rightthinking person could ever disagree with all these nice smartguests            Knowledge is a violent bright hot thing butyou would never know that watching Moyers says Laurence Jarvik author ofPBS Behind the Screen and a Moyers critic            Moyersdefenders say that television has enough strife elsewhere very little of itilluminating and that its important that the airwaves offer a civil forumlike Moyers There is lots of truth to that view But I cant help wishingthat Moyers would sometimes apply his keen mind to confronting those whodisagree with him Compare Moyers with  Minutes  whoseroughandtumble ambush
