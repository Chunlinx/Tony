                if you dont cook though what do you like to eat if you go to a dinner party   well uh im uh a bit of a seafood lover i suppose uh i have a health problem in that i my cholesterol is high   um   so im in the in the process of bringing that down so i dont eat a lot of beef or pork or almost none   uhhuh   so i would say most likely a dinner party would be you know would include some kind of fish seafood or you know or poultry type dish as the main course   uhhuh well uh i was just thinking as i was listening to this recording go over and over till they found a party for me to talk to  i could talk about a dinner party i had uh Sunday   but uh   right   and it included some seafood so that would probably be uh appropriate for you   well uh that sounds good yeah   uh i had uh some people from Germany visiting and they are uh fans of American shrimp   umhum   so i did a kind of a stir fry dish with shrimp that you shake up in a bag with a little parmesan cheese and flour and then uh quickly uh fry up in a little olive oil and then uh take out of the wok put some uh red strips of red pepper and green pepper in   uhhuh   stir that a little bit uh add some uh sliced mushrooms and then put the shrimp back in with a half a cup of white wine and just bring it to a simmer   yeah yeah   and then you serve it on rice and its really a a pretty low cholesterol dish   yes that sounds sounds really good uh   because its done with the uh shrimp and the olive oil you dont use any kind of beef fat or   umhum right yeah   no no animal fats in it   right and thats   And its very popular and it looks very pretty and uh with rice and a salad youve got a a meal   yeah right that that really sounds good uh im a a uh frequent as frequent as possible traveler to the New Orleans area and so we eat a lot of seafood my wife and i eat a lot of seafood when we go down there   um oh thats a good place to get it i miss it i lived in Houston for a long time and  we loved to go over to New Orleans to eat   and uh yeah uh oh did you   but uh we we have not been there uh since last summer but uh its were looking forward to going back as soon as as we can     uhhuh   uh but we eat eat a lot of shrimp and uh eat oyster dishes and uh we like uh things like uh the poor boy sandwiches with the fried oysters on them course im not supposed to eat fried oysters any more but thats uh we like that that and uh love gumbo   oh yeah oh yes   and uh   oh i wish i had the recipe for my grandmothers gumbo she used to make the most wonderful crab meat gumbo with shrimp and all sorts of other goodies in it   yeah right yeah       goodies in it My job was picking the crab   oh yeah so uh   not my favorite part           but uh but i guess uh my like i said im not a cook so my wife probably does or does definitely do you know all of the cooking for you know when we have a dinner party uh   uhhuh   i help with with what i can and uh you know we dont have uh uh something on the order of what you had uh you know it dont main dish and probably some kind of a starch and a vegetable   uhhuh   and uh we eat a lot of rice and and uh the the bell peppers that you uh sauteed are just right up our alley we eat a lot of that a lot of mushrooms   yeah   uh   well the reason for using those is that it makes such a pretty colorful dish People always exclaim when you have the red and green peppers and if im making a whole lot uh i use a yellow pepper as well   right umhum   for one pound of shrimp i use one red pepper one green pepper and oh maybe half a dozen ten mushrooms medium sized mushrooms   yeah   and thats plenty for four people and if theyre light eaters you can squeeze in six   yeah yeah yeah if you if you wanted to uh put a little crunchiness in that uh throw a few cashews in it   but oh yeah thats good uh my husband is a Chinese cook he doesnt do much cooking either but he loves to cook Chinese and he has a marvelous uh chicken with cashews and   yeah but uh right and uh right the cashew chicken is is i i really enjoy that   and the Szechuan peppers now those are not the hot ones those are the little round pink ones   oh yeah just right   and oh they are wonderful that uh he does that uh uh chicken with cashews and Szechuan peppers and he also not at the same meal does a wonderful vegetable dish with Szechuan peppers but use that uses either asparagus or um     right yes   lets see what does he use asparagus is the one we like the best oh broccoli you can do the same dish with broccoli and also if youre really in a pinch you can do it with just celery   umhum yeah we uh we also uh uh cook on a do an occasional dish with uh some kind of a Mexican theme   and its pretty good uhhuh   and uh we you know have discovered that you can make you know just as good a Mexican food with uh with chicken or with even with turkey we we do cook a lot with turkey and it you can come out with you know good spicy Mexican food   uhhuh   and uh and make it chicken or or turkey or something like that instead of going with the beef like when we make fajitas we can make you know chicken fajitas and and enjoy them just as well   uhhuh oh i like them too i think theyre great uh we ive been trying to convince the cook at uh at the place where i work uh we are kind of isolated and so we dont go out to lunch very often   yeah and uh   and we do have an excellent kitchen uh which is encouraging for people to stay around and uh eat and interact with one another at lunch were a think tank   uhhuh   so thats one of our functions is to  get people to talk to each other and she has started cooking uh much healthier food much much more uh salad without mayonnaise and   uhhuh yeah   uh much more main dishes without oils and uh and vegetable i mean and uh animal fats   right   so i think were improving our diets i dont know whether its the California influence or whether its everywhere but   well i think its everywhere i i i know that uh oh probably at least half of the people that i know are on some kind of a low fat diet for one reason or another or are low fat or no fat   uhhuh well my husbands cholesterol is not real high but he his father had uh an early heart attack and so he is very conscious of his   right   uh physical condition and he walks a lot and tries to get uh to stay in pretty good shape and to watch out for high cholesterol and since i prefer the kinds of foods that one eats on a moderately moderately low cholesterol diet anyway that suits me just fine   yeah we have found that uh since weve stopped eating so much beef and pork that when we do eat it it tends to upset our systems   um yeah yeah   and uh you know its uh my wife in particular when she uh she said you know when she eats uh some kind of a beef dish if its the the least bit spicy along with the beef itself that she really her you know her stomach really acts up so   uhhuh   so we eat uh eat very little beef and uh we just   yeah we dont either we just eat it once in a great while and uh its usually if were having company and its somebody that we know is a big meat  fan but therere fewer and fewer of those   uhhuh right yeah uhhuh   so we also do an awful lot of cooking when its just the two of us on a little tiny uh  grill its   uhhuh   oh its less than a foot long and about eight inches wide and we just put a few charcoals in there and uh we can cook a piece of chicken we buy boneless chicken breasts and save us ourselves a lot of time   umhum   And that with uh do have you ever tried Lawreys Lemon Pepper   oh   you can buy it in the grocery store   yeah i i dont know whether weve tried that or not i i know weve got a weve got a uh is that uh the salt   its a well it has sea salt in it   yes i think weve got a   but its not the same as they have the Lawreys seasoned salt and the Lawreys seasoning Lemon Pepper and the Lemon Peppers the one i love on chicken and fish   uhhuh yeah   and uh yeah just barely brush it with oil grill it uh so its not too done and sprinkle a little of that on it and then i add some lemon thyme from my garden   umhum   and that makes an excellent and very easy to fix dinner   yeah you know its uh about fifteen minutes until noon here and were talking about food and im   well i hope you have a nice lunch     yeah its been a its this is a this is a good timely conversation you know got my appetite going   im just looking at our menu unfortunately were having a terrible lunch here today for the cholesterol people because uh were going to have Italian sausage and French fries       i think i may stick to the salad bar today   right yeah okay well its been nice talking to you and uh or maybe we can have a good lunch and think about it while were uh about our conversation while were eating   nice to talk to you too okay byebye
