        okay well um lets see     i understand you have more aggressive laws both in uh Washington and in Oregon than than we down here in Dallas   well um yeah possibly um im not familiar with the laws in Texas but weve got a citywide recycling program here in Seattle thats um uh well well its its its really amazing how many whats that   is it mandatory is it mandatory   um  well they give you really good incentives  uh they pick up the recycled goods they give you they drop off containers at your house so its like its like garbage collection um and you dont pay for it   uhhuh   and uh you same uh basically at the same time they jack the garbage rates way up and and made it so you had to have city provided garbage cans that were of uniform size   uhhuh   so we were amazed when we you know recyclings one of these things that we did kind of once and awhile but it was uh you know something that i always put off because you had to haul the stuff and and so i you know we didnt do it much but i was amazed at how much we reduced the uh   the volume   the uh the volume of our trash   well Ted down here weve had the uh containers available in you know various public places now since the mid seventies but just in the last few days theres been a proposal now to have uh i believe its about six times four to six times a month theyll have a curb pickup theyll give you containers that are color coded so you can put cans and glass and   yeah its like what we have yeah   but the difference is we have to pay for that   oh really   about three dollars and um twenty cents or so or something like that i i was about half asleep when they were talking about it on the news but um it is not going to go over too well as long as you have to pay a premium to participate i dont believe   yeah unless they structure the garbage rates so that uh you know it like works out to be cheaper   well the garbage rates here are high however as long as you bag it in plastic bags you can put out up to ten or twelve bags of of trash   oh my yeah they stopped that here they used to have it so that like you could get two can service and you could have huge cans you know that you furnished yourself   uhhuh   and then you could put a bag out with each can and in fact if you put out more than that theyd pick it up anyway and now theyve really tightened up course theres some down sides to this too um theres i dont i i dont know i hear that theres more of a problem with illegal dumping after this when it you know after the rates went up   i suspect were having some of that here too   and yeah and then uh the other thing is what do they do with all the stuff theyre just theyre going to recycle they now have this huge glut of paper        um and its difficult to find markets for it so the as a result the um price of recycled paper has gone way down because you know there isnt there isnt enough demand for it all   yes well weve had some what the same problem here i think newsprints down something like um under a dollar now per hundred weight     oh my   and it used to be two and three and i think it even got above three at one point   yeah remember when the boy scouts used to do paper drives and make money   yes yes there used to be a recycling center where youd take things in and you know theyd weigh it and pay you and they had paper and of course aluminum cans which are still very viable here   yeah   and they had uh clear glass and colored glass        but i noticed recently that place has closed up now my daughters really active active in some of this and she theres a place oh about eight or nine miles well i guess its about six miles from here where you can go and uh few things they pay you for most things they just take   yeah   but um the movement here has not really progressed theres Texas is always slow on a lot of these things   yeah i understand until recently you could actually have an open container in your in your pickup as you go down the road there   um yeah that was kind of disastrous       of course weve had um major problems with them driving while intoxicated and all that i think theyre finally starting to get things a little a little more squared away but theyre a long way from that yet uh Texas has always had a tradition of uh people staying away from i mean laws the laws really leaving you alone unless you were clearly doing something   right uh its its out of the old west you know like you know   yes        just recently there there now uh well up until recently you could have a a rifle behind the seat of your pickup and all that kind of stuff and now theyre starting to discourage you from that um     yeah   and in theres parts of town here now where
