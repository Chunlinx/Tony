        uh so i uh weight train uh three days on and one day off   uh so what do you do to exercise umhum   i uh ride bicycles  um fifteen twenty miles i dont know maybe three times maybe four times a week i play basketball uh couple times a week i play softball one night a week   hm   uh thats what i do what about yourself   hm thats pretty impressive um  i guess i bicycle uh the amount varies as much as a hundred fifty miles a week um   uhhuh   i guess i play softball one night a week and i backpack a lot over the summer   oh really   yeah thats thats about the extent of it i mean i dont do any of those things particularly you know for exercise but um i guess the bicycling is the one thing ill sort of like do if i feel like i need to go exercise um but i do it mostly for fun   yeah what um what do you ride uh like bunch of hills or flat pretty flat   it it it varies uh out near my house is pretty hilly um but sometimes i bike to work which is about um a fifteen mile trip each way and thats mostly flat   how long does that take you to get to work   about forty five fifty minutes   how does how does that work work out with uh storing your bike and showering and all that   yeah it can be a pain um basically uh i work on a campus so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the uh campus to the uh gym use the shower there uh but its its enough of a pain that   uhhuh   i did it consistently one year i would commute everyday um but it just became such a pain i mean we were talking you know forty five or fifty minutes for biking um and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind   right   and then another half an hour you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff it was a big hunk of well hunk of the day um and then of course another hour to get back home um so ive been doing that less and and concentrating more on you know light biking when i get home on the evening and then you know some more on the weekends   yeah do you ride a lot of rallies are lot of those around there   not so much um i guess mostly i bike on my own ive got a touring bike   uhhuh   um though i havent gone on any extended trips with it how about you what kind of biking do you do   uh well actually my wife just got me into it and i did a did an internship at the Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas at Cooper Clinic and i learned all the health benefits of   umhum   i you know i was a solid weight trainer and all i did was weights and anaerobic exercise and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise said you really need to do it so   umhum umhum   once i got into this uh internship i learned all the physiological advantages advantages advantages to it so i began a program couple i dont know probably three or four weeks ago and i did my first bike rally  this Saturday i did uh forty forty miles   hm   and uh thats the longest ive ever ridden so far i usually you know fifteen or twenty  and it was it was kind of hilly and it was pretty tough but   umhum   uh im looking at uh doing a lot more of it because you know my wife is really into it and i i kind of   oh i see   held her back a little bit this this weekend she wanted to go go go but you know she wanted to stay with me   umhum its good to have a partner   yeah it really is   are you you thinking of doing any like centuries or   yeah thatd be cool sometime if i could you know work up to that   umhum yeah i just wondered if youre were gonna do that mostly or more like you know uh um uh touring like from Vermont or you know that kind of thing i mean people seem to get into different aspects one is more of a distance and ones more just you know they wanna   oh   put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour   ive never really looked into that that you know thats my wife would just love that and i may do that sometime there again im just kind of a fledgling into this   umhum umhum   ive its kind of funny id called this number and i just reading through a a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up i mean around Texas you got   yeah yeah   you got about five or six different if you live around the Dallas area you got five or six every weekend to choose from because theyre really into it   oh thats nice hm   bicyclings really big here i didnt know that and you know till i came down here and just kind of caught the fever  because i lived in Indiana all my life and   wow yeah   you know you may say one see one or two guys on a bicycle that are above the age of fifteen or something but other than that its nothing up there like it is down here   umhum yeah im not sure why that is i mean generally in the midwest it seems to be less much less i mean maybe its because of the winters   probably   uh or maybe just because you know theres theres a lot more flat lands you know out in the west so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation   yeah yeah and  theres a lot of bikers around here its its really neat   umhum   there are a lot of a lot of resources lot of magazines and stuff little Texas Bicyclist is like a newspaper that comes out every month   hm   and its free you just go to the bike shock bike bike shop and pick it up and its got all the rides coming up so i guess im gonna be busy about every Saturday this summer going to a different ride yeah see a little bit of Texas ive never seen before   oh thats terrific umhum   so uh how long have you been biking   oh i guess as an adult for just about the past uh three years or so um you know i guess the last time i did it before that was college which was about ten years ago and uh yeah i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while um   yeah   until i suddenly disevered all my friends were basically biking a lot  and so i thought id try it too   have you ever had a uh its kind of slightly off the subject but you ever had a uh a blood work up done recently or since you been biking to see if it because it really   no i havent no   from what i understand it really improves your uh cholesterol and and you know it uh it kind of knocks you down two uh the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is uh   hm   uh low cardiovascular fitness and also uh you know the cholesterol it gives you uh increased HDLs and decreases your LDLs yeah so   umhum oh thats great yeah ive ive definitely noticed its had a good effect on my pulse rate my resting pulse you know it gets it down to about forty yeah   yeah really thats good   yeah   you say you ride about a hundred hundred fifty miles a week man thats thats hard core when do you get to begin with the winters and all that   yeah on average yeah   or what time of the year do you usually embark on your do you ride inside if you cant ride outside   no im not that hardcore i mean there are some people in fact there are a lot of people wholl ride outside in the snow theyve got a uh mountain bike you know with the big knobby tires     yeah   and i dont do that i basically i i pretty much lay off for the winter uhhum i was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter you know because itll help your balance when youre indoor training   hm   um but but i just you know more or less stuck to like an exercise bike and that kind of thing um but yeah i mean winters are kind of a problem so im more or less out of shape now that ive been biking i guess this year for just a couple of weeks   uhhuh   um but you know up here its  its only stopped snowing since then uh   yeah   but yeah its its its its pretty good its uh the main the main thing i guess for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like you know exercise and a chore ill lay off of it more   right so you uh change up your routes a lot and keep a   oh yeah yeah i try to go someplace pretty different you know every week i rotate around um about four different routes um from my house or ill sometimes come in to school its nice coming its nice its nice riding to school because its all along a canal path um because its just its along the Erie Canal up here  uh University of Rochester   so what school is it oh okay yeah   so thats fairly picturesque and uh so its its its a good ride as long as youre not doing it everyday its a good ride   yeah yeah thats true sounds neat its kind of i was wondering if i was gonna   yeah   talk with someone that never has exercised before and doesnt want to and everything else but got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty miles a week thats something motivating   yeah   thats really good well   well it was good talking to you   good talking to you and keep up the good work all right take care bye   okay you too bye
