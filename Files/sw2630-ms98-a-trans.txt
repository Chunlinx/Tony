                okay  he did whered he decide to go     um to Williams College in Massachusetts   uhhuh sure im familiar with it   and that he was he was uh trying to decide between University of Pennsylvania and Williams and it was a very difficult choice and uh   and he well he must know is he interested in law or medicine he must have a definite profession in mind   no but thats one of the reasons why he chose Williams that it has solid liberal arts   oh okay medium size arent they   about two thousand   is he excited   very excited yes uh i have another son whos at their chief rival Amherst College   wow i can i uhhuh while theyre east coast i mean i dont know anything about their football but there you go   well theyre theyre theyre really very strong academic rather than you know big sports   yeah thats where where you at   were outside of uh Washington in Maryland how about you   oh okay im in uh suburban Dallas   uhhuh do you have children in   no i dont i have a husband  we dont have any kids yet about all i can say is i guess about picking schools um i guess uh if you dont know what youre going to do liberal arts program is a good idea   okay um well i i one of the the advises weve given our children is that you can always learn a job   this is true   uh but what you cant learn uh on a job is a good solid well rounded well rounded education   right the humanities the history yeah   thats right you know the Renaissance man and uh and if you get that you can and if you do well you can you can learn a job   right right no no no yeah but they you know if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school usually a company it will if its worth its weight will subsidize and   thats exactly right thats right so the advice we gave to them was number one visit the colleges that youre thinking about describe first of all   uhhuh this this is true yeah   the size school that you might be interested in   and if you want to go away right   do you want to go away how far from home do you want to be   right   what do you want in a college now my son is a national level competitive swimmer   good   so he wanted to swim in school but he did not want to be in a swim factory   okay so he wouldnt have gone to something like where were at theyd in Austin Texas University of Texas   thats right thats the University of Texas at Austin or Stanford or something like that so he didnt even consider those   right Texas Aquatics yeah okay well thats i think the other thing is too um i know i went to a uh city high school in Chicago and a lot of the kids werent as fortunate as say my brother and i were and economics was the choice um   uhhuh uhhuh   sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school   he is very very strong academically yeah so weve just but you know he had to look to see what kind of environment he liked and yet he he did wind up having to make a choice he did apply to a large you know large group   uhhuh yeah University of Penn im originally from Pennsylvania Pennsylvania University of Pennsylvania   its got about nine thousand undergraduate   yeah thats strong i mean thats you know and its its well its a little bit i dont want to use the word wilder thats not the word i want um more diverse   yeah yeah yeah uh yes and it but it does have the under you know thats total undergraduate with five hundred graduate school so that the uh the college of arts and sciences is you know i guess about four thousand   at Williams or Pennsylvania at Williams at Pennsylvania well how large is Williams   at Pennsylvania Williams is an undergraduate school only um and its a total of two thousand   right well thats not bad   yeah so he knew the feeling because my other son is at Amherst which is fifteen hundred and he had visited his brother at Amherst and knew that he liked the environment but he did go on college visits and he liked   which is a lot uhhuh thats the thing to do i mean i not having any children my husband was an Ohio State person and uh that has something like either the first or second largest   umhum   student population like fifty thousand combined community   yes yes its large and they both boys had decided no that they did not want that   yeah that is too much and i mean i um i can only say its strange your son picked those kinds of college because i spent a year at Bennington in Vermont um and that was this was twenty years ago showing my age   oh its so you uhhuh and did you ever eat at the Blue Bin Diner   yes oh my God where are you from well lets not talk about that   okay no but weve been there when im up at Williams weve gone up there   its um in that area i mean i just cant say enough about it   oh its it whatever we went and he was you know impressed by the clean air and he he met the students at both schools and he liked them   well you know um my husbands an engineer and a strong liberal a strong liberal arts background with uh a graduate degree in a technical field will get him much further than say like a a strong um business administration degree than with another MBA on top of it   uhhuh thats okay thats it the thing is if if a person really knows very early on that they want to go in a technical field than youre not then its probably good to go to you know to apply to a school with a strong technical program   uhhuh and they usually yeah but they usually dont   but uh for if youre going into if you know engineering is the thing if then youve got to at least take engineering   right but they no but who does i mean i think i think all i think the majority of people just dont know no he looked at criteria such as location size of school yeah   thats right uhhuh no he didnt apply to any school further the furthest away was Bowdoin in Maine which is about twelve hours   thats still pretty far though i mean a lot of kids just dont even want to go   yeah that was the furthest and then Kenyon in Ohio which was about six and a half hours and Williams is about seven   oh thats not too bad   yeah so well i mean he so it wasnt he you know then the University of Pennsylvania is like two hours from here by train and then Bucknell in mid state Pennsylvania   yeah he will enjoy Williams i think and  is a good academic   yeah and he knew and if it came down i mean as he came hes been talking to them and and he came down and one of the things that       he said is he went to Pennsylvania this weekend and he had an absolutely marvelous time he had a great time   uhhuh   but then he said you know it was such a good time that i almost got the feeling that their emphasis is on having fun   that could very well be i mean   and he said it almost backfired i think it backfired   so hes developing his his uh internal instincts right now thats good because i mean im sure what he said was true that uh you well actually thats one of the reasons i went to uh Kenyon he went he made a good choice i went i   so   i well swear w ere not supposed to but i spent a year in Vermont my freshman year it was just too far away it was too different uh the level of income of lot of the students and their attitudes was just um beyond my   umhum yeah well   um in terms of drugs et cetera which i thought was shocking   of course that period too was probably difficult to for you but i did uh my advice to him and my husbands was that   right yeah youre right but then i went yeah   he had to really decide what he wanted out of college he had to look at himself uh in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it he could probably slip and it wouldnt be caught up until it was too late where in a smaller school where especially in a Kenyon or a Williams where you see the professors around town all the time you skip class in the morning and they see you   uhhuh and youre going to get a little bit more input  than discipline yeah   thats yeah yeah and a swim coach is going to be right on top of you uh so that and he will know the professors in a small   well i dont know how to put this either in this way and then it doesnt sound like your sons would need this but i just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today i think the refinement that they get i dont mean specifically etiquette or culture but just what youre saying just a solid background   uhhuh yeah yeah   because i just dont think at that age i just dont think that young people know what they want to do   thats right thats right and um and its just the personal contact where if you need help   you know and um thats right   he has i told him to look to yourself are you the kind of person that will go into a large college and if the professor says ive got office hours but you really dont feel that you know him because youre in a class of a hundred that youre really going to look him up but if its a class of fifteen   right right lecture yeah this is very very   and you need help you know that its much easier to do it and especially in the large schools they have lectures   oh   and even though they may break it up into smaller groups uh Penn is known for having   they have video lectures yeah video lectures   graduate assistants teaching they have graduate assistants to teach the smaller groups   this is true and i mean that is very ironic too that your son just made the did he just make the decision today   just a he made the decision uh id say about uh an hour and a half ago   how funny   yeah i mean thats so funny i mean and and in fact he had just an hour before that two uh recent graduates from Kenyon spent close to two hours talking with him   well hell thats funny   and uh i mean and he they were really nice and but he said is that they didnt tell him anything that he didnt know but they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better   it was easy for him to rule out he knew what he didnt want thats exactly yeah now is your other i mean were talking about what you think but obviously youre experiencing it uh did your other son um   yeah yeah right now yeah my other son is just as happy as a bed bug he the moment he knew he he decided early on that Amherst was the school hes a classical guitarist   a clam oh wonderful   and he decided he also got into the Yale graduate school of music as an undergraduate for classical guitar but he decided he was going to go to the um   uhhuh the smaller and the   the smaller now and then graduate school later   and theyll do fine in their studies and im sure theyll go on to graduate school and   well hes really my older boys real happy and hes minoring in English and he had thought about economics and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasnt   and now hes a senior hes a senior or is this early admissions   hell be hes finishing his sophomore year so hes double majoring   so hes so hes yeah well sounds like you have two talented sons   well you know see the advice we give is to not limit yourself especially this you know go to a school where youre not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two   i think and a lot of people talk about and its not the economics im solely zeroed in on but i think a lot of people think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return   yeah   and i think that a lot of people shy away from the smaller colleges colleges because of that and i think its rather sad   well one of the things we said is that they should pick the college this was our advice too irrespective of the cost that somehow we would manage   you are wonderful parents   well we place a real high priority on education in our family   no and i agree i mean my husband and i in fact im taking my LSATs um im thirty something and taking my LSATs on June tenth   oh good thats wonderful oh thats great   um the point being and your sons will learn this from you im sure that uh no matter what age you are you can learn   thats right thats exactly   and it sounds like theyre going to you know theyre just
