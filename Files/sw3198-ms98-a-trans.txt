        okay       did you want me to go ahead   ill let you go ahead and start yeah   okay well one thing i i i guess both of us have very much aware of the equality uh it seems like women are uh just starting to really get some kind of equality not only in uh jobs but in the home where husbands are starting to help out a lot more than they ever did um its not uncommon to see men doing dishes making supper or taking care of the kids versus um the generation of my parents and my great grandmother which uh they did everything they went to work and they took care of the family so   you know i think thats changed just in the last generation just in the last little while because i know my fatherinlaw doesnt do that much of that   exactly exactly yeah   kind of stuff but my husband is wonderful   yeah thats the way my husband is too i mean it it doesnt uh doesnt bother him at all to do the dishes it doesnt bother him him at all to do the laundry versus uh men from     yeah   way back there is that well if you did that you were henpecked or whatever but   yeah yeah there still some that arent cooperating but   men are starting yeah those are very few i think those men dont last very long in relationships because they think women know what they want   theyre not accepting that anymore yeah   right exactly and its its hard enough to be a woman out there trying to do everything uh you know and then kind of realize hey theres just no way that we can be happy trying to do it all so its its kind of a a neat thing to see as far as equality in the households and i think thats even gonna get better even you know even more so i think its just gonna be where men will do as much cleaning as women do   yeah   and that it wont be your job description instead of your role definition is this it will be uh hopefully for my daughter who i instill into it doesnt matter if you wanna drive a truck honey or if it doesnt matter if you want to be a nurse it doesnt matter if you want to be uh the President or it doesnt matter if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor it doesnt matter its what you want to be so i have always instilled into her and i think mothers um are doing a really good job in raising their daughters to say hey you dont have to stay with nursing you dont have to be a secretary you dont have to be you can be whatever you want to be and whether it be a welder a trucker or whatever   yeah   as long as you uh go to school for it and get the education so   yeah well i feel like um to an extent that is really important you know that that um it is important for women who need to work uh or are in a position that they want to   umhum umhum if they want to right   that they can do that um but i also think it is important for them to be with the children   umhum i do too you know theres a certain part of me   i i think there there are some things that women just are designed to do better than men  and there are some things that men are designed to do better than women i dont think it should ever be totally equal   uhhuh yeah yeah   you know thats not  uh were not made like that thats right   well emotionally i think uh women  do a little bit uh i i think thats  the gap is coming closer  as um what ive learned in uh just just being out there it seems that men are now starting to get into groups called mens gatherings and they get together and they talk about issues of marriage talk about manhood talk about what they didnt have with their fathers   hm   are expressing more emotions learning what emotions are it may be in the future that men you know some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves um   yeah   i i know of some mothers that uh i guess id rather be with the father because the father is maybe more understanding more um low keyed more apt to be a better father than some mothers that i have seen that have been raised you know to develop whatever skills that they have and some of the men are developing uh very good too so it may come down to where its   yeah   its individual basis where everybodys treated as an individual and not by   yeah   sex if you wanna stay home and take care of the kids honey thats fine i will go out and make the uh take care of the uh money making and it it wouldnt matter if its a woman or a man saying that       one of the frustrations that i have with the way things have developed is that   umhum   and  for some its not a problem but theres more and more its difficult for a family to make a living on one   on one income umhum   income it can be done but you make sacrifices you know and and its um   yeah yeah that kind of like what uh my husband and myself are doing right now my daughters three even though at this current time shes ready to get involved with shes an only child i dont know if youve only got one   yeah
