                                 Twitchy Bush Extraterrestrial Forbes                        Evan            I was happy to see you refer to a restaurant where people smoke freely attheir tables as unsullied just as I was discouraged but not surprised tolearn that cowboys in Marfa Texas are dreaming about easy IPO riches Atleast theyre smoking as they do it Someday even cowboys will be smokefreeand doing TaeBo and America will have lost something            Pardon me but Im in a nostalgic mood Must be the effect of watching lastnights debate Bush did a decent job I thought but he just didnt comeacross the way he did six months ago He seemed far stiffer and more programmedthan I remember His physical restlessness which always stuck me asappealingly energetic and vital all of a sudden seemed twitchy and nervousPart of it is context Bush is so much better in person than he is behind amicrophone that people whove experienced him only through television must bebaffled by his endorsements and fundraising success But its more than thatI think hes changed            This spring for instance I asked Bush about his reading habits He waspretty straightforward about preferring pagelong briefing memos from his staffand sports on TV He didnt pull a Dan Quayle and brag about reading Plato inthe original Latin But last night when Brit Hume asked him what he wasreading Bush boldly claimed to be immersed in a book on Dean Acheson            Theres nothing wrong with not reading books about Dean Acheson There issomething awful about pretending you do Humes a pretty nice guy so he didnthit Bush with the obvious and tempting followup questions A book about DeanAcheson huh Quick Whats the title of the book Who wrote it How many termsdid Acheson serve as vice president Thats a trick question Gov Gotcha            But the Acheson phoniness wasnt Bushs real problem last night He didhimself the greatest damage when he agreed to appear with the other fivecandidates in the first place Yes I know he had no choice that the politicalcosts of ditching another debate were too high Still its hard to maintain afrontrunners dignity and mystique if youre sharing a stage with AlanKeyes            Not to beat up on Keyes I like him He seems sincere Hes a totallycompelling orator one of the few people Ive ever heard who speaksextemporaneously in flawless perfectly delineated readytoprint paragraphsAnd I agree with him on more things than you probably care to know about Infact Keyes doesnt really fall apart until you administer what I think of asthe Despot Test Its simple If a candidate had absolute power how manypeople would he kill Keyes doesnt do well on this part of the exam At allTheres something about his eyes            Speaking of I had a pretty disturbing XFiles moment toward the endof the debate when I looked too long at Steve Forbes Mesmerized by hisunblinking stare I suddenly had the feeling he was going to steal my soul Ichoked back panic and turned away probably just in time Spooky            I think Bush has had the same experience which may explain why he wascomparatively tough on Forbes who poses no real threat to him while he wentout of his way to stroke McCain literally at one point on the cheek who hasa shot at beating him in New Hampshire With Bush one gets the sense that a lotof politics is personal Doesnt bother me At least he knows an alien when hesees one            BestTucker
