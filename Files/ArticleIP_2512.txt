                                 Server Time Out            Last month the FederalCommunications Commission dialed in a  billion subsidy to help schoolslibraries and rural health care providers purchase Internet service Theprogram which will help pay for Internet access and internal data wiring atthe educational and health facilities resurrects a two century old debate inthe political economy What services should the federal governmentsubsidize            Underthe rubric of universal service the feds already require business and urbanphone customers to subsidize rural customers to the tune of  billion Somestates mandate phone discounts for the poor and make up the difference byboosting other users bills In the name of universal service the federalRural Electrification Administration spends  million subsidizing electricpower for upcountry customers And since its inception the government hassubsidized postal service to rural addresses at the expense of urbancustomers            Universal services original proponentsmaintain these services are so essential to modern civilization that it wouldbe unconscionable to allow the market to price them beyond the reach of theless affluent In that spirit the government currently believes theInternetwhich just a few years ago was considered a luxury is now anecessity             Themerits of universal telephone and postal service aside there are severalstrong arguments against an Internet subsidy             You canlive and learn quite handsomely without access to the Internet             Many ofthe poorer rural communities that have applied for the subsidy lack the highspeed phone lines that make the Internet worthwhile keeping them Internethavenots             Wherefast rural lines are available schools and libraries can scarcely affordtextbooks and periodicals let alone new computers and training for Websurfing             However wellmeaningthe new subsidy technology is moving so fast that the old regulatoryapparatusbased on permanent scarcity and obstacles of distancedont applyto the Internet            If thefederal government is serious about making Internet access affordable toschools and libraries it should disconnect this program            The Internet erate subsidies as theyreknown were authorized under the  Telecommunications Act and are fundedwith new taxes on longdistance telephone companies the size of each companyscontribution depending on its market share ATT and MCI have protested thetax and pledged to pass the cost on to consumers MCI charges  percent on allout of state longdistance calls and ATT charges a flat rate The FCC hasreceived  erate applications and expects to start handing out funds thissummer            Inplaces like rural Alabama Mississippi Louisiana New Mexico and Arizonawhere there are no high speed Internet lines schools might be willing tosettle for POT plain old telephone connections to the Internet at  kps Butfew Internet service providers serve rural America because the current numberof consumers is too small for them to make money For these communities theFCCs erate department recommends dialup services like AOL that offer access at a pricey  cents a minute premium If you connect  hours a day andsix days a week to the Internet via AOLs  line youll pay  ayear assuming an AOL service rate of  a month            A library with the maximum allowable eratesubsidy of  percent would still find itself paying a monthly Internet bill of That might not sound like a lot of money but its  many strappedlocal libraries dont have And if they did have it theyd spend it onperiodicals new books or capital improvements As previously mentioned theerate discount wont cover any portion of the hardware bill either leavingthe local community responsible for PCs modems and training for teachers andsupervisors            Theerate plan also mistakenly imagines that high speed affordable Internetservice will never reach rural America without government help Perhaps theeraters think technology is still crawling along as it did when Theodore Vailcut his monopoly deal Instead the cost of computer gear is fallingprecipitously and affordable bandwidththe measure of data transmissionisgrowing at an exponential rate Click for a graph that illustrates the growthin bandwidth            The Greenlee County Ariz public libraryillustrates the money and technology woes of rural institutions The threelibraries in Greenlee population  operate five PCs one of which isdedicated to public accessword processing CDROM access and the likeGreenlee librarians are the only ones who can access the Internet and they doit sparingly over the libraries one phone line to a free Arizona StateLibrary connection How much could Greenlees libraries afford to pay to bringgreater Internet access Anything that costs more than  cents isprohibitive says Head Librarian Rebecca Oliver Next years library budget ofless than  must cover four staffers salaries and other expenses            Todaynobody disputes the argument that Vails telephone monopoly stifledtechnological innovation The first round of telecommunications deregulation inthe s that opened longdistance service to competition benefited consumersand spurred innovation Likewise since the  court order that dismantledthe ATT monopoly the market has produced new and affordable technologiesthat have revolutionized telephone service Do we really want to ghettoizerural Internet service as a welfare operation when the best telecommunicationspolicy seems to be to let the market work instead Cable and satellite TVdidnt require subsidies to serve rural customers Why should the Internet            Already technologies are emerging that reduceInternet access costs and increase bandwidth for rural users DirecPC and othercompanies now provide Internet access via satellites that boast download accessspeeds of up to seven times that of POT connections The cost is  for thesatellite dish hardware and  a month for service Several companies suchas Home and Time Warner are marketing high speed Internet access over cableTV lines with a national rollout of the service only a couple of years awayCurrently cable lines run past  percent of US homes and many smallcommunities have a cable TV provider in their central districts where schoolsand libraries are One company has even experimented with transmitting datasignals over common electric power linesand at speeds of up to  megabit asecond which is  percent faster than even DirecPC If this technologyproves successful it would make much of the telephonebased part of theInternet obsolete almost overnight            If the last two decades ofderegulation have proved anything it is that subsidies are easier to avoidthan they are to repeal Also subsidies reallocate resources that would bebetter spent elsewhere As bandwidth continues to grow exponentially and theprice of hardware continues to fall rural schools institutions businessesand individuals will become a lucrative market The erate might look like theanswer to rural and poor Americas technology problems but it isnt Goodthings come to those who wait
