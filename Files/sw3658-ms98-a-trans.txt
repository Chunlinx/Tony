            okay universal health insurance right   okay um thats right   um   what would we like to say  i think   well i think universal health insurance like national health like what Canada has is that what youre youre thinking this subject is about   umhum i think thats what the subject is about   did you read uh the article in the paper today about this particular subject   in the Dallas the Morning Times i guess i did not   yeah uh the state of Washington and the state of Minnesota is uh going to begin testing a program a state funded program for citizens of those two states and theres fourteen other uh states that are considering it least according to the article in the paper this morning i think its a trend thats thats thats uh probably may go nationwide eventually because i think national health is something that we all need its getting to a point that you have to have it you have to have some form of health insurance and extremely expensive though   well its been interesting that we yes so we live in a society though where everyone if you ask them on polls will um say that they think that everyone has a right to health care   umhum   and yet i dont think weve ever quite decided whos really supposed to pay for it and   well thats the thing you know uh unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are are paying for the people that dont have health insurance   which is why people are talking about we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way thats more fair   yeah i dont think you um   you have health insurance through your company   yes i do uh through my company yes but i have been in a situation uh recently where i was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year and my wife developed cancer and we didnt have any insurance   oh my goodness   and it was uh   that mustve been horrible   go to Parkland type situation   how was your care at Parkland   uh because it was a life threatening situation it was very good uh as it as it turned out one of the top um people or one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at Parkland   but Camp Parkland is not free either   no its not free but uh   is it affordable   its its a situation that because i didnt have any insurance and i was on unemployment it was paid by the county   so you did have a good experience   i had a bad experience as it turned out um i was fortunate that there was Parkland   is your wife better i hope   uh no she passed away oh thats all right that happens   im real sorry sure it does happen but its very sad   yeah but in any event um im in favor of national health   well so am i  actually um im a pediatrician and i feel very strongly about um children and um developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year   if i had to vote for it oh is that right umhum umhum   where we certainly proved that were not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most so um im really quite active in trying to uh uh be proactive at least to for childrens issues its very complex very complicated but um i just strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization glasses hearing aids  basic health benefits   well i when i grew up and i grew up in south central Kansas um we had and my mom worked for the health department the county health department and we had X rays every year we had a dentist come to our school and uh check our teeth once a year at least um we had all our flu shots taken care of our measles mumps rubella and all that other stuff and uh when my children were growing up   um   we didnt have that we had to pay for it which i wasnt opposed to paying for it i had the money to pay for it but im sure that there were people that dont   well and the costs of so much has gone up so much the cost of immunizations for example um and just the legal the legal benefits um that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily et cetera   umhum   so well i dont know its it is interesting in case you didnt know Texas leads the nation in uninsured children thirty one percent of all Texas children   did not know that   do not have insurance and are not on Medicaid so uh one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care and i work in the childrens Parkland system and its pretty overwhelming to me   umhum   but um its pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in Dallas county
