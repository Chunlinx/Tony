            okay Ellen what kind of a car do you think youre going to buy   well as a matter of fact i was thinking about that the other day and uh i really dont know the answer um       i would sort of like to uh think about something in the way of uh uh sort of a sporty car but not any not you know a luxury type sporty one but um   yeah   something that still has a lots of amenities and you know gadgets and things   oh you do want a lot of that stuff     yeah well yeah i like i like some of those things they come in really handy   what kind of uh things are you going to consider you know what uh you said something about the about the well what do you call them you said amenities   amenities   that they have but what about um their reputation of the company or the price   um well of course i guess uh price is always the big consideration but   it is for me other people dont seem to have the same problem   yeah   well thats thats a big one in my book but uh um   yeah   i have preferences for uh for some um makers over others um and i would sort of like to buy American   yeah   but you know im not so totally hung up on that that i wouldnt buy something else how about you   well um the last car we bought was American because of because of that reason but have not been entirely happy with um several things about the car it doesnt seem like the quality is quite as high as i expected it to be   oh really   because several things minor things sort of but still they cost us money um that we didnt feel like we should have had to pay on a car that that was that new   umhum   you know we bought the car new and after  um well well well under two years we had to replace the clutch   oh   and they just said well you know clutches are disposable and i said since when brake pads are disposable you know we know that but i never thought a clutch was disposable   yeah yeah yeah i wouldnt have thought so either   yeah so that was that was kind of a shock   oh       oh yeah i i guess theres a lot to to think about when youre trying to make that decision   yeah you know the less actually the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars theyre called luxury cars even though theyre much more expensive like like uh um a Mercedes Benz they dont have the history of breaking down or things like that that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable   right   you would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes   no but then um   especially not after two years   no but on the other hand i guess too uh whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune   really oh i dont know     yeah ive uh worked with a couple of people who have owned uh various years uh Mercedes and   umhum   even though they do a lot of the work themselves then just buying the parts and everything is is pretty expensive but for them its its sort of a hobby too to own them   yeah what kind of what brand of car are you thinking about buying or like what things are you looking at   well i havent really really gotten that far with it um ive always sort of liked General Motors a little bit better than some of the others but uh   umhum   oh i guess i really dont know   how come  ive been kind of um i guess the commercials are getting to me the Toyota commercials and i know that a lot of people ive ive known that have had Toyotas have been just extremely happy with them that hardly had any problems at all   yeah yeah that i think thats   i think they have a really good um quality   umhum my uh daughter has owned two different ones and uh you know weve had some work done on them but its not too bad and the reason one of the reasons we um bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a Toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years and he lived way out in the country so he put a lot of miles on it   umhum   and you knew it had had been through a whole lot   umhum   and yet you know it it held up pretty doggone good so   yeah   i thought they would   they seem to be really durable   yeah   so i dont know im im not ready to buy a new car yet but i dont know if if the next time im going to try to to stay with buying something American or if im going to go for a little more what i would consider to be a longterm investment   yeah       well and i guess you know you always have to think about things like your gas mileage and stuff like that you know you   oh its easy to get gas mileage in this car it gets excellent gas mileage   yeah yeah thats one of the big throwing cards for some of the foreign ones   umhum   well we talked long enough   i think so   okay well enjoyed it byebye     all righty thanks byebye
