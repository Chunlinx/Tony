          okay i uh i think in general that the the uh one of the biggest change in in uh the role of women in the last two generations is the fact that because of the uh probably the national debt as a matter of fact but the uh impossibility of of uh making ends meat even in a family that which has a two two parent family   umhum   but many women work out of the home now   umhum   and probably that is the biggest uh change of her role that she now has to um not only be uh mother um nurturer or whatever but she also has to to help earn the earn the income that comes into the home   umhum umhum   and uh and it has   oh i id agree with you i think that is one of the big big changes   right it has uh uh has a lot of effect on a family and it can be positive and it can be very negative   umhum   uh and uh i think a lot of the problems that we that we have in in school in education a lot of the problems we have in drugs a lot of the problems we have in in uh uh juvenile delinquency whatever probably can be laid right at that door   hum   because uh a child who does not have the kind of underpinnings that you can get uh with uh with a parent in the home whether its the father or the mother   umhum   uh it just does not have the same kind of opportunities as the one who does   umhum   thats the kind of uh what would it be uh uh calming influence or whatever   umhum   uh i think another thing it gives them the feeling of of uh the importance of their position   umhum   as a child you know and and course most of their problems come from uh lack of ego   yep   as opposed to too much ego most of them uh do things because they either want attention or because they they feel that theyre not worthy   umhum   and so they they do things that theyre not not what the the norm would like them to do   umhum   so that it is always kind of negative   yep   what what do you feel about how do you feel about the role of women  being a man that make that gives you a different   well i mean i i i agree with you substantially i think uh i think getting women because of you know declining standard of living were not living as well as our parents did or making as much money um and um that was probably to a degree true for them i mean its no longer the case where um many people can afford to have one parent stay at home and raise the kids or whatever so a lot of people are opting not to have kids or both parents are working and you got to rely on things like day care   thats right   uh to raise the kids and certainly thats not going to be as stable an environment as uh when you do have a parent at home   yeah i think thats probably   taking care of them and i i agree with you completely i think thats thats certainly having a lot of effects on our society   yeah i think so do do you have children   um no i dont no im single   no   um but um the i mean i think thats one of the major things and i think thats had a lot of side effects in the way women get treated in society   yeah   um i guess one of the things that we can concern ourselves with is is how things are likely to continue to change uh in the immediate future   i i think thats probably true i think one of the problems is that that government in their meddling  tends to encourage that   yeah   instead of discourage it instead of giving you a break so that maybe a wife could stay home and do   yeah umhum umhum   something satisfying in another area you know i i think there are women who need to do things other than just be a mother but i think thats possible   right   i mean i dont think that education or anything else starts at school it starts in your head   umhum um   and any  anyplace you are you can educate be educated   i agree with you i agree with you   and so it it doesnt mean they have to stop doing all the things that they might want to do and uh and so but   umhum   but the environment   and i dont think it i dont think it even means that all women necessarily have to stay home and raise kids either you know i mean it should be optional   no no nor do they have to stay home all the time   right   there are lots of ways that they that you can do this but the but the problem is that they have so little choice   right well id like to see for example more flextime in the workplace i mean i think that would certainly help things   yeah yeah i think thats right i think that would be good   um a greater acceptance of parttime jobs   right and have and have and and if if anybody is going to help them decide about uh about day care or something maybe it needs to be something worked out in uh in uh   uh   in uh um  a workplace   umhum   so that they can their children can go there so that they can see them so that they can have this uh you know during lunchtime or whatever   umhum   some kind of a better uh contact and more uh a better feeling of of the fact that they are the important thing in this household as opposed to the work   um   schedule being the important thing in this household   yeah i think theres also a lot of interesting side effects to women having taken a more prominent position in the workplace i think its changed the workplace in in a lot of respects   umhum   and uh interestingly enough it also seems to have shortened uh womens life spans so theres     i would imagine thats right   theres theres something to be said about you know all the stress related kinds of things that that happen when you do have a full time job   thats right thats right its not and and and the the problem is you see that it isnt just the stress of the work but they but they had plenty of stress before   uhhuh   now theyre just doubling their stress and thats and thats really   thats right   uh really more than you can take sometimes i think thats true thats true i i think that uh   umhum   uh there are a lot of really positive things about the changes about uh uh more women going for for uh better educations and uh   umhum   all these things i think in uh in a persons life there are a lots of   they have more freedom   right and there are lots of of stages of your life where you can do things that you didnt do   umhum   uh at some other time that uh if youre better prepared youre going to be able to take advantage of those things maybe later or or maybe during sometimes   right well i also think theres no longer sort of this predisposition that the woman has to be the caretaker and the upbringer for the children i think thats starting to dissipate   right   and i think thats good too i mean theres no reason why the father couldnt do it uh   yeah thats right i think so too with   i i agree with you that i think someone needs to do it thats important   someone needs to do it thats the thing we just we just came from our son just graduated from uh from in his Masters degree and his wife is a nurse and he had just graduated in social services work and uh   umhum   uh when she went back they just had a a baby in January and when she went back to work she says okay ill work ill work five days in two weeks but it has to be the times when hes home   umhum   and so that one of them is taking care of this baby all the time but its a neat thing to watch because hes as  adept at it as she is   umhum   and and equally as comfortable and i think that is a neat thing it itll itll be neat for the children too if you can get a relationship like that but where the where the husband is comfortable   right yeah i think im   doing those things because children badly need more of that   yep well i i think it will help the kids be better adjusted when they grow up   badly need more of that thats right badly more well hey its been good to talk to you   yeah its been nice talking to you too   yeah all right have a good day umhum byebye   you too bye
