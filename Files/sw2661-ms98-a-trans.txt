          so eating out       what are you interested in in restaurants   right um we eat out quite a bit its just my husband and i at home now so   oh uh once a week twice a week   oh at least once a week were were retired now when we working out we ate out more than that   yeah i understand     uh   uh but we both work and we have a daughter and we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway   uhhuh well what type of restaurant do you like Richard   uh really im kind of open on food im what you might call a culinary adventurer ill       ill try anything once   right   been on a real barbecue kick lately   oh have you we like Chinese we eat a lot of Chinese food   yeah   excuse me uh yeah we usually have Chinese once a month   uhhuh what do you look for in a restaurant   uh i hate franchised restaurants   you what you   i despise franchised restaurants i i   oh i   always prefer to go to something that seems more family run uh   right   some place where you seem to have the attitude like youre going into their home for dinner almost   i know what you mean i like some ambience and i like good food i dont like fast food hamburgers and all of that   i dont but i dont like something fake or put on either uh   uhhuh   you know if i could have the the good small restaurant or a good large restaurant id go to the good small restaurant   uhhuh   and i dont know why that is i think its probably due to pricing often   right uhhuh i dont care to go to a place just for the price of it huh   well yeah yeah   i mean its uh continental French restaurant or something really   yeah   with high prices and seven courses isnt what i usually look for     it is what you usually look oh isnt isnt   it isnt no that isnt what i look for   uh i try to get my moneys worth   right   and uh not just that i try to well thats a big part of it i try to get my moneys worth   uhhuh   you know and not just in quantity you know but but quality and and flavor and and texture and care   presentation and   well presentations not always all of it either its its important   well like we weve been eating some in a restaurant that that just changed hands recently and were trying to give them a little patronage but   but   Sunday we went there and i had a pretty good meal of grilled pork chops and a baked apple and potatoes   umhum   but i said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce or something like that   yeah yeah something a little extra     yeah thats what i mean by right uhhuh   and just for color if nothing else   it would mean a lot to the looks of the plate   yeah yeah what i miss up here is im originally a Texan and im miss home cooked Mexican yeah yeah home cooked TexMex uh Mexican restaurants where   TexMex TexMex     its not owned by an Anglo or a corporation   right i know uh   and   we have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico and weve really gotten to like we like the real Mexican food better than the TexMex   yeah well theres real Mexican food and theres real TexMex Mexican you know by third or fourth generation Americans   right   of the Hispanic heritage   its all pretty good isnt it   oh yes  and and theres big differences of course and   uhhuh   of course when you talk about Mexican cuisine you thats kind of like talking about American food or or a Chinese food because its regional too   right uhhuh thats true   you know   im originally from Maine so we like seafood too and thats something we dont get here and were in the mountains in Virginia     ah   and most of the seafoods frozen     ah yeah thats  the way it is here in Colorado also no fresh  or almost no fresh seafood   right   and   in Texas we got it from the Gulf   uhhuh true lots of shrimp   and yeah here a couple years ago my wife and i went to Seattle on vacation and i think everything except breakfast was seafood for almost a week and it was   i know it   i was like a man starving at every meal   i know the feeling we do the same thing my soninlaw is a Texan and when he goes to Maine he eats lobster i guess at least twice a day all the time hes up there   ha       its a lot cheaper there isnt it lobster   oh yes yeah its like   its like shrimp on the Gulf   two ninety eight a pound for a pound lobster   two ninety eight a pound   yeah   thats as cheap as steaks some places   oh yeah or cheaper right yeah a lot of the restaurants you can get   i mean in a grocery store yeah   two pound two one pound lobsters for like ten ninety nine   oh my gosh  ive got to go to Maine then i you may have sold a trip for some time       yeah its a good place to go   uh it sounds wonderful uh so   lots of little restaurants too with home cooked food that up there   that sound good i   yeah   down in the Gulf ive eaten a bunch of those little oh seafood shacks weve called them   right uhhuh   and uh its just it so much different than to eat something thats been frozen   uhhuh   you know   we went to Galveston   shrimp straight out of the bay bay   we were in Galveston last year after right after well the first of this year actually   hm   and uh ate in a restaurant and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the Gulf Coast   was it true   no it wasnt on the way across Louisiana we pulled off we saw a billboard and just pulled off taking a chance on a place and they had it was a small restaurant just kind of out of the way and they were set up with two buffets one for their regular Sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and everything and then one complete seafood buffet   um             that was the best shrimp i have ever had in my life they had shrimp fixed probably six different ways   ah yes the cajuns   uhhuh right it was wonderful   they can they can do things to shrimp that that no one else can so have you eaten crawfish yet   uhhuh uh i tried it but i didnt care for it not there but at my brothers i tried it   oh as with anything its preparation   thats probably true it i wasnt hungry it wasnt a meal we just he went down and bought some at a local place that steams them just so wed try them   uh uhhuh       it theres all kinds   probably needed some cold beer with it and     so you do eat out a lot   quite a bit   uh one of our other real problems with going out to eat Sunday morning brunches   oh   you know Sunday brunch all all you can eat brunches   right we used to do that once in a while but we dont anymore   uh we still find it fun   uhhuh its fun but its just so much food  hate to come away feeling uncomfortable   but well am       i work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor   do you well that makes a difference   and so   where do you go to brunches like hotels or restaurants there   uh yeah uh actually one of our one of our favorites is a chain Shoneys   oh yeah uhhuh   and in spite of the   we eat at Shoneys   and in spite of the fact ive spoken so badly about chains chain restaurants uh   we uh do like Shoneys pretty well but then theres a place up the pass up in the mountains that we pretty reliably like to go to on some Sunday mornings drive drive up to i think its about eight thousand foot elevation and   oh   and and drive through Woodland Park and go for a short drive in the mountains and have breakfast and   uhhuh that sounds nice   it it its the way to spend a a nice Sunday morning   right i imagine it is   i think its as much the the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch you know  and its not that far its thirty miles     uh uhhuh where out of which direction from out of which direction from there west uhhuh   the Colorado Springs what west west out of Colorado   yeah
