            okay um the one of the things that ive heard uh many people complain about the school systems was that       they didnt feel like uh people were dedicated to teaching their children   uhhuh   or their heart really wasnt in it you know so what they went and got a degree and and everything but it wasnt       their not doing it just because they want to     are you saying the teachers or the parents   the teachers the teachers   uhhuh     you know well how do you feel about that   well i guess i have mixed emotions on one hand i think golly the pay isnt good enough if you didnt really want to do it   yeah you shouldnt be doing   its probably something else out there but on the other hand i think that maybe some people have thought that was kind of an easy way out you can major in something basically useless to the world as a whole like say Spanish or geography geography being one of my favorite subjects but   uhhuh yeah oh really   nevertheless its not exactly the thing thats going to make you bucks   right   but you could then go ahead and get a teaching certificate and perhaps feed your family a little   yeah what do you think about the the recent bill that was just passed you know where   uh   theyre taking the money from especially the the Dallas area   youre calling from Texas then   school oh oh yeah im in Dallas Texas   im in Plano   okay yeah theyre taking uh the money from our schools here and distribute it some of the other outlying and and especially like west Texas what   umhum umhum   what do you think about that because its its you know the moneys coming from us here that live here and work here and   well i have always believed in sharing   uhhuh   you know if my neighbor next door was hungry and they needed something to eat or something to wear id be glad to share and so i guess in the global sense you have to have that kind of feeling to a certain extent but   right   i also dont believe that people who get funds or equipment  or anything without some of their own personal input   uhhuh   take care of it nicely or appreciate it or use it properly   right   uh those things have to be taught     excuse me yeah i agree you know   so you know so theres that end of it too and and i think its going to really   you know so i dont i dont say that in a selfish way because i think there that its probably not totally equitable   yeah     and i dont know that there is a good situation entirely but golly   yeah   it sure going to make a big difference in our school system   yeah it is   you know it uh i was umhum i was talking to a friend in Irving who sits on a parents advisory council with the Irving Independent School District and she was saying they are number one   Plano yeah   they are adding next year they are adding thirty minutes to their school day   uhhuh   in order to accommodate the extra teaching thats going to be needed because theyre eliminating all aids theyre going to they all aids all paid aids everything is going to have to be volunteer through the parent teacher organizations   oh really uhhuh uhhuh   and frankly were all ready maxed out with parent you know uh volunteer   yeah   work i work parttime out of my home and they did you know   uhhuh   im always getting called and you know and used utilized you know what im willing to do it but i know during the days when i was uh just not a working mom at all it was ridiculous   yeah yeah they call you all the time   uh yeah yeah until i just finally had to say i am so sorry that you know just cannot do everything for you   umhum yeah   but uh   i agree   you know so theres and and the moms that work a lot of times just cant help at all and yeah   right well i i i believe that the school puts a big demand on the students on the teachers and the students for for the fact that they expect the parents to go out and a lot of times chauffeur or lot of times you know buy a lot of things that might seem unnecessary but i its unreal on the cost of sending a kid to school because of you know you spend your time voluntary and     umhum       plus you buy a lot of extra arts crafts aids things like that notebooks for reports     so many yes well and just you know the yearbook and the Tshirt and the teachers presents and the you know it really starts   right     you know we have five children so i know that it really   projects oh my goodness so you really do yeah like uh all types of projects little bug things you know that   you know umhum i just helped a little girl yesterday a teenager friend of ours she had to prepare something for to study Greece   uhhuh   and they were i think she needed a recipe and the history of of the recipe or the type of food and also um had to actually make it and bring it enough to serve you know fifteen people and i found the cheapest thing i could find that i could help her with and even so figuring it up i think she spent close to twenty dollars   oh my gosh yeah   um and it was say you know we did a couple of different ones and it was the least expensive and   uhhuh   and still be able to fix it at home and tote it up there and what not so   right   but thats   thats amazing because if if every child does that what are they going to do with all that   yeah its a lot of money yeah and would they really eat it of course thats not really you know the quality of education   yeah umhum   but   you know i think that probably you know here in Plano we are uh of course state legislature you know added uh five days next year   right   and uh i think were going to be seeing alternative calendar very soon i im still basically against it although i i do understand the positives   uhhuh   that are you know touted but i think overall   how do you feel about the Plano school system you feel like its pretty good compared to the others surround you know Richardson and Allen and   there is a quality of excellence expected here its very difficult for the children in this school district to excel in more than one area   right   because if you get into drama if you get into speech if you get into drill team or athletics or whatever it is i mean they want you night and day they want your time they want your blood   oh really yeah money and   you know so and uh you know i have children who been fortunate enough to be in in these extra curricular things but golly you know its just really you know its like a smaller school system you know you could be in the drill team and you could be cheerleader too and you could be you know on the football team and still be on the basketball team and still try out for band you know   real demanding   basketball right yeah thats amazing   so you know that and you you cant do that in this school system so you know weve been working on college stuff for my oldest daughter and shoot you know   thats a thats a big difference uhhuh   that uh you know you kind of you know you have to to look when we were writing things down i said you know you cant really talk about all your individual things but you know youve got to make sure that when you put down band here that its not just any old band that this is a band that took this honor and that honor and participated in this competition and participated in that competition so they understand really   uhhuh right right thats wild well its been good talking to you   well yeah this is uh this is interesting interesting topic     thank you uh good night byebye   thank you Jackie have a good day byebye
