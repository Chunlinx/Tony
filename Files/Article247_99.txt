                                 Talking Points for the Times            To New York Times Editorial Board            Re Your Coming AntiWorkfare Editorials            The Times has just concluded a fourpart frontpage series slammingNew York Mayor Rudolph Giulianis workfare policies egEVIDENCE IS SCANTTHAT WORKFARE LEADS TO FULLTIME JOBS Even now presses are stamping out thecapper the first of what will probably be many righteous editorials denouncingthe program It happens that workfare is an old hobbyhorse of ChatterboxsChatterbox thinks its the key to successful welfare reform which is the keyto solving Americas most pressing social problem the problem of ghettopoverty And aside from Milwaukee New York is the first big city to giveworkfare a try If it can make it there             One point your series made seems indisputable If what Rachel Swarnsreported is true Giuliani simply doesnt have an adequate day care system inplace yet Hell have to do better As for the rest of the series lets stickwith the major conceptual problems                           Misconception  Its the Overriding Goal of Workfare to MovePeople into Private Jobs Politicians like to say the purpose of welfarereform is to move people from welfare to work Thats certainly agoal But its not true that unless welfare reform takes all the people onwelfare and gets them private sector jobs its failed The overall goal ofreform as President Clinton said in a neolib moment is to break the cultureof poverty and dependence Its a culture that traps the poor in isolatedfatherless ghettos Its also a culture that hurts the larger societynot justthose on welfareby producing crime destroying urban life fanning racialtension etc To change that culture you dont have to get every unmarriedwelfare mom into a job The idea is to establish the principle that everyfamily has to send somebody into the workforce Enforce that principleand some of those on welfare will go to work Other mothers may choose to livewith breadwinners and spend time with their children Other women not onwelfareand this is the big payoffmay decide not to become single mothers atall postponing childbirth until marriage Eventually communities offatherless welfare families will become communities of intact workingfamilies Thats the idea anyway            Even if you think the point of welfare reform is to get everyone into aprivate job thats not the immediate goal of workfare Workfare isusually only one part of the larger welfare reform plan Most plans attempt todivert those who apply for welfare into private jobs They require those whodo apply to search for work Only those who fail to find private sector jobsare then offered workfare jobs so they can earn their benefits Workfare ineffect is the employer of last resort A fine old liberal notion Its crazyto expect the people who wind up in these lastresort workfare jobsabout out of  adults on welfare in New York Cityto be the ones whowill fly out the door into the private sector                           Misconception  We should worry because only a third of those who leavewelfare quickly turn up on the tax rolls as workers The Times hasmade a big fuss about a New York state survey showing that of the legions ofpeople who came off the welfare rolls in New York City from July  throughMarch  only  percent found fulltime or parttime jobs in the firstfull quarter after they left welfare Yes we want to know how many more peopleare working thanks to welfare reform But the people welfare reform will pushmost successfully into the private sector are those who now never show up atthe welfare office in the first place because they realize theyll dobetter just getting a job The survey completely misses this group            For those who do go on welfare the survey only counts those who then workfor private sector employers who report them to the state for tax purposes Itdoesnt count selfemployed laborers domestic workers and others if they dontreport their income It doesnt count those whose employers dont fill out therequired forms Many employers who do file their forms do it late Experiencewith earlier groups of welfareleavers shows that the  percent figure willrise about  more percentage points to about  percent when theselatefilers eventually comply Finally just because someone doesnt get a jobthe first quarter doesnt mean they never will A study of Marylands reformdiscovered that  percent of those leaving welfare had earnings in the quarterthey left but  percent had earnings within  years            Even if a single mother leaves the rolls and doesnt get a jobremember that doesnt mean reform has failed She might have moved in with aman even gotten married She might be getting help from friends If formerrecipients were showing up in shelters or on the streets it would be bad newsbut that doesnt seem to be happening                           Misconception  Workfare workers shouldnt do work unionized cityworkers used to do At times your reporters object that workfarers domenial unskilled deadend work At other times they complain thatworkfarers have taken good desirable union jobs away from others Which is itIt cant be both The truth is that the more the mayor asks workfarers to douseful work like streetcleaning the more they will probably be doing workregular city workers once did So Is the work low paid Sure If workfare isgoing to be the employer of last resort it cant pay good union wages orelse half the city will go on welfare to get a workfare job Nor did theTimes show that any regular workers were laid off or fired to make wayfor cheaper workfarers            Chatterbox will go for now Give em hell
