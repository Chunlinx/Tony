        uh well lets see   how many you said yours are all i mean that sounds like an army     five   oh lord       that is an army i came from a family of six and i have only got two and theyre one   well any number is nice let me tell you   well i kind of decided that single single children that that thats not parenting thats a hobby but   yeah its not as fair to the children either i dont think   well dont tell that to all my friends       theyre into quality time im just into getting through the day   oh yeah but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too   well i i can i can spot a kid who really you know whose parents spend every quality time with them you know outside of the work day and when i take care of some peoples kids you know when they when they have teachers holidays and that kind of stuff i will take my friends kids   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   that are usually in day care and you can spot them because they have no idea how to just hang out and mess around   uhhuh you can tell how to just entertain themselves   yeah really   yeah yeah its a problem for any child and you take one thats used to being uh busy being having something to do all the time it makes a big difference   its not a problem for my two theyre only eighteen months apart   uh keeps you busy   they can they can find things to do and mess around and and   yeah   plot and scheme and everything else so you did all five of yours complete college     well thats great no our last daughter she didnt want to go to school shes uh but shes married now they built a home just a couple miles from us and   well how did you go about selecting a college then   well we didnt do it right all the time with our first boy we persuaded him to start here and i do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home i think the main thing is to uh right now i feel the main thing is to look at what theyre interested in uh and take what theyre interested in and then then start looking for schools   do you think that what they say that they are interested in is at eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately ultimately graduating at   no not necessarily and but like our oldest boy i think he would have he wanted to go to Embrey Ray Riddle and we talked him into going local here first   uhhuh   and he only went a few months and then transferred to Pittsburgh he went to aeronautical uh oh just learning to work on engines and that   uhhuh   uh it has to do with airplanes and everything which is what his whole life is  and i really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally and he would probably be flying is what he would be doing uh but but right now of course hes hes working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut and they build and rebuild uh jet engines   how about the other four other three who went   uh the other ones uh the second one she chose we let her go where she wanted to uh we didnt want her to go but she went to Erie to Gannan University uh or Gannan College im not sure which it is college i guess uh she went there two years and it was more expensive and she soon realized you know even though she didnt like Clarion she came back and finished at Clarion because it uh saved her quite a bit of money and she got really the same basic education that she wanted   uhhuh   and our other uh two boys they went to Clarion also and uh did very well there and theyve all really got uh theyve all really got really good jobs and uh   when they were like in junior high and high school i mean had they did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and   uhhuh uh yeah they kind of had that they just expected to go Daphne never went she always said she would never go to college she said i i always thought shed change her mind you know but she didnt and theres nothing wrong with that you know if college isnt for everybody   uhhuh   but uh it it does make a difference in your pay wage income i think its what they want out of life because if they get an education and are willing to go where the jobs are they can make a you know a much better income   uhhuh   like my kids theyre all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state   yeah i was i was making more than i was making three times what my father was making as an executive in the insurance industry when he retired   you know that boggles my mind uhhuh uhhuh okay did you go to college   yes i went uh four years undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln because Lincoln is where where my parents lived and there really   you did see it makes a difference uhhuh uhhuh   there really wasnt a choice i mean the finances uh dictated that you had to go there   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   i kind of i am not going to say i resent it but i was well one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and you know one of the Rhodes Scholars kids and the whole bit um   uh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   my parents didnt even discuss with me going to college out of state or anyplace else and i just knew that the finances you know would not support it if i had known   someplace else uhhuh   how not im not going to say easy but how much less difficult than i thought it would be to get a uh scholarship to go anyplace else i think that i   uhhuh   would definitely you know have gone now when i finished there then i got a scholarship to go to the Harvard University in Boston and that was uh i think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened i mean i was   uhhuh thats great   taken out of my element you know the the the homogeneous Midwest which is a lovely place to grow up and put into someplace else where people thought differently looked differently sounded differently uh   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   uhhuh different life styles yes yeah   different life style and i think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me   uhhuh   now my kids i keep saying that uh you know i would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could   uhhuh   i dont know you know what the realities is going to look like you know were putting money away already uh but i really think its important to put these children someplace where in addition to   uhhuh   you know them getting an education they really need a a you know a socialization away from what they are raised in especially if you lived a pretty insular community and uh   uhhuh right   an upper class suburb of Dallas let me tell you   its quite a bit different   its very different   see thats the way w e are were more of a rural type of a area and it does make a difference i they say you shouldnt look at the expense of the college when you are looking   you should not   yeah not really because they say a lot of times you get more help   uhhuh   with a more expensive college   oh yeah   and so in the long run if its really what they want you know theyre better off now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school uh we we did all we could   uhhuh   but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go
