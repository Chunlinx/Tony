        okay have you faced uh       elderly care yet uh nursing home care for any of your parents   unfortunately yes uh in fact tonight i had a dinner with uh my three brothers and our wives and we were talking uh we had a review with the nursing home staff my mothers in a nursing home   uhhuh   and uh we had a review today and a few things we had to do that are part of it that you dont really like like uh making decisions on living wills and extended care that type of thing so yes im very familiar with it and its not something that is uh   yes   you know i never thought id have to go through this kind of an experience but i guess we all do   i think sooner or later uh both my mother and my husbands mother we had to end up putting in nursing homes and they were to the point that they only lived both of them about six weeks once they got in   oh really   and uhhuh and its absolutely i believe that was one of the hardest things i ever did   umhum   in my life i that it just you know its absolutely devastating   right   what have you found in dealing with the nursing homes   well theyre not every all the horror stories you hear about them i think are true uh   yes   weve we you know weve looked around and my wife has looked at extensively at all the ones in the area  and the one she is in now um theres a lot of drawbacks a lot of things we dont like but again its no different than everyone and you know the cost of it three three thousand dollars a month when you think about it for what youre paying a hospital for   hm umhum   almost the same well even not as much care   yes yes   its not that expensive really   no uh there was a little bit of difference in in the two between my mother and my motherinlaw   umhum   and uh theirs both ran oh i think my motherinlaws was like fifteen hundred and my mothers was two thousand then this has been five years ago and uh uh one of the things that you know i had discovered is that   umhum   if they knew that i came in there at all different hours they got much better care than if when i started out with my motherinlaw because she was in there first   umhum   i would go certain hours and they knew and if id pop in unexpectedly i discovered you know they did a little bit they did better   oh really   you know uhhuh and you know a couple of times with my motherinlaw i would catch something not being taken care of and you know would have to raise so i got to where i knew then when my mother was in   umhum   that you know not to go the same time all the time   yeah   and they would and when i was looking for the nursing homes another thing that i learned uh we had my mother all set to go into one and for some reason i just went back and on my own went around the different floors   umhum   and i saw areas that they had not shown me and they did not come across as well   well ill be darned   as you know what they had originally shown me so uh we did not put her in that one we put her in another one that i i went a couple times when they werent expecting me and saw and you know was much uh better pleased   umhum yeah   with the situation   yeah you you know this is the whole point youve got youve got to shop them   yes you do   i know my mothers in now in a unit thats mainly Alzheimers   uhhuh   and um were convinced that she probably would be better off in a geriatric   umhum   uh the fact that these people are  theyre up and around but theyre theyre its reminds me too much of an asylum type situation situation and its very very   uhhuh uhhuh does your mother have Alzheimers   she well who knows they call it uh dementia   uhhuh   and uh we dont know i mean she does not know us anymore   umhum   and whether its Alzheimers or what it is nobody really knows but its basically the same and her health is not that bad   umhum   although she has gone down downhill drastically since this this this last well she had been in a retirement community and somewhere in so were in the back of her mind she had it that she would live with her children well   uhhuh   she we we just did not have the capabilities to to take care of her and uh but she she has gone down steadily since she has been in and shes been in the nursing home now for  oh i would say about three months   umhum did she know that she was going to a nursing home did she know that she was going to a nursing home   and im sorry she no as far as she knew she was going to a hospital   umhum   and that she could she could handle a hospital and we says you know mom if you you know if you get a you get better youve got to have the care the doctor insisted on it you know if you get better that you could come out
