                well the topic is is very apropos to whats going on um how do you feel about our topic     well i feel like uh i do feel like we pay a lot of taxes i dont mind paying a lot of taxes if the taxes taxes are spent well   yes   but uh im not convinced that theyre being spent well um   um i think thats because uh its like i told someone the other day im a housewife and uh among uh working mother too and i know how it is to live on a budget and i hear what youre saying   umhum umhum umhum   you know our taxes its nice to see them spent for things that benefit the community but when we see them wasted thats when we think were paying too much   well i feel i i mean one of the things is when its it its not going its going into a lot of military stuff which is badly spent   umhum   and not going into a lot of infrastructure things uh or or um you know social needs   um   that that it could i mean when you look at the pie its uh where our money is spent its its uh very very um skewed   yeah   and uh so i dont feel like i i just dont feel like theyre doing what i would do with it     well i think uh in a way thats thats uh almost off our topic in you know in that uh they didnt want us to talk about how it was spent but i dont think you can separate it i know um i felt very fortunate once when i talked with a lady from England and she said their taxes are at least fifty percent   uhhuh   and uh in talking to people ive met from other places uh we do seem to get off light except you know if you ever make money one year now you pay all this horrible taxes and you dont get to keep any of it   well uh but the people who pay a lot of taxes also get a lot of services they have national health   thats   so you know uh   oh yeah umhum   in other words yes thats why i say   in the other countries   yeah so im saying if we did i wouldnt mind paying what we pay   umhum   or even more if i got a lot of stuff back for it   yeah   but uh   well on national health so many of them cant use it they say because they never can get in to see their doctors   yeah   at least in England   i we hear that here uh some although we get some people who obviously dont want it like   umhum yeah umhum   like rich doctors   yeah   who whod rather us not have it i think but i dont know i i just and local taxes um i think are probably just about the same you know the school the school taxes and all of that income of course is not a a topic in in Texas yet but im sure its coming   umhum i hope it doesnt i uh i hope not but i dont see any way out of it unless we start cutting some spending drastically   yeah no thats true ive lived in uh states where they had income tax and you you know and you just get used to it   yeah   but uh again again um it just depends on what theyre what its being spent on   of course i i think the sales tax is about the most equitable tax there is because if you dont uh buy and participate you dont have to have to pay it   um   and uh that way people who use the facilities and live outside of the area basically help pay some of the upkeep for it   yeah and sometimes and sometimes i think it does work that way um   umhum   but they you know uh uh again its its you you you have the different kind of taxes then then then what are they being used for and who is deciding what they are being used for   and how much is spent to administrate administrate them   right   yeah   all those people are doing those things and and and i know that the stories i mean i personally know people who have been in this place where you know they theyre having trouble paying their taxes and they   umhum   uh like you would with a bank you know go into the IRS and say you know you can you can do all this stuff to me and get nothing or give me you know let me pay this out and youll get it all   umhum umhum   and theyll say no you know and i think now wait a minute that was my money you said no with well well well youre not going to get it all uh   yeah thats right yeah and and one of the things that makes it so hard on these people they slap so much penalty and interest on it   umhum   that they can triple it in nothing flat   yeah i mean its the one place that theres no recourse at all   umhum   and a lot of people arent trying to get out of it but trying to figure a way to live and pay it back   right   and they just they dont accept that at all so   umhum
