                                 Ira Magaziner            Last month US DistrictJudge Royce Lamberth ruled that White House aide Ira Magazinerthe architectof President Clintons  healthcare proposaland White House lawyers haddeceived his court in a  affidavit Officials had run amok in theirresponse to a suit filed against the government said Lamberth and he orderedthe government to cover the  legal bill incurred by the plaintiffs            Thedeception that Lamberth complained about was contained in one sentenceof a page affidavit filed by Magaziner in response to the suit DidMagaziner deceive the court as Judge Lamberth insists he did            First a little history President Clinton formed amember task force in the first month of his presidency appointed HillaryClinton as chair and gave them  days to draft new healthcare legislationMagaziner a member of the task force organized an interdepartmental workinggroupcomprising bureaucrats and healthcare expertsto supply the taskforce with facts and policy proposals Magaziner divided the working group into cluster groups and  subgroups The number of workinggroup membersgrew from  to              The taskforce and working group conducted their proceedings in secret Soon after theworking group convened the American Association of Physicians and SurgeonsInc and two governmentethics watchdogs filed suit arguing that the closedmeetings violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act of   FACAdesigned to check the power and proliferation of presidential commissionsrequires that the meetings of working groups appointed by the executive branchbe open to the public However FACA exempts committees consisting entirely offederal employees AAPS argued that because Hillary Clinton and other membersof the task force and working group were not federal employees the meetingsshould be open Later the courts ruled the first lady should be treated as afederal employee            Judges routinely criticize FACA as ambiguousand overreaching  The law even fails to define government employee anddoes not specify what constitutes membership on an advisory board Respondingto FACAs ambiguities the courts have whittled down the law For instancefactfinding panels that dont propose policy have been exempted Congress hasfurther limited its scope passing amendments that exclude from FACA anAmerican Bar Association committee that rates the qualifications of judicialnominees for the government the National Academy of Science and otherlesserknown panels But the courts have also upheld it In  the Reaganadministration beat back a FACA suit to make public the meetings of an advisorypanel of CEOs            AAPSsrequest for a temporary injunction against Clintons healthcare task force wasrejected by a US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in which concluded that more information was needed to determine whether theworking group qualified for a FACA exemption In  the Clintonadministration abandoned the healthcare initiative and released alldocuments from the working group            On Dec   Lamberth dismissed the suit against thegovernment but he asked US Attorney Eric Holder now deputy attorneygeneral to investigate whether Magaziner should be held in criminalcontempt for supplying false information in his affidavit filed March  The investigation turned on a single sentence in which Magaziner statesOnly federal government employees serve as members of the interdepartmentalworking group Lamberth insisted that this sentence contradicted indisputableevidence that private citizens attended the working groups and that some ofthem played supervisory roles The judge was especially irritated by thepresence of executives from managedcare conglomerates who stood to profit fromthe new legislationexactly the sort of conflict of interest FACA was intendedto check Judge Lamberth says that the appeals court took at face valueMagaziners only federal government employees declaration when it ruledagainst the request for a temporary injunction            AlthoughHolder chided government lawyers for formulating a sloppy overlyaggressive response to the AAPS lawsuit and took Magaziner to task for usingilldefined legalistic language supplied him by White House counsel VincentFoster he concluded his investigation by declining to prosecuteMagaziner for criminal contempt He found no factual errors in Magazinersaffidavit and no evidence that he had intended to willfully mislead the courtIndeed deep into the affidavit Magaziner volunteers the information thatconsultants who were clearly not government employees played a prominent rolein the working group Charges of criminal contempt hinge upon proving beyond areasonable doubt that there was an intention to deceive and evenLamberth accepts that such proof is unattainable Holder also acknowledged thatMagaziners muchcontested onesentence statement was not an important elementof the governments FACA defense Unlike recent Justice Departmentinvestigations of the White House Holders earned near universal acclaim EvenLamberth deemed it commendable in his ruling last month            Yet Lamberth still believes that Magazinerdeliberately misled the court and that government lawyers acted in badfaith and he maintains that the appeals court might have issued an injunctionagainst the task force and working groups if Magaziner had not made hisnowfamous onesentence declaration He writes The most outrageous conduct bythe government in this case is what happened when it never corrected or updatedthe Magaziner declaration            The governments lawyerssuspect that the real source of Lamberths ire is not the sloppy sentence in anaffidavit but the government attorneys hardball tactics and unwillingness tocompromise which drew the case out for four years
