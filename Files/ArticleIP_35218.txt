                                 Swann Song            Last week a federal judge ordered Charlotte NCto stop busing students to integrate schools Newspapers noted the perfectsymmetrybusing had begun with the Supreme Courts  Swann vsCharlotteMecklenburg Board of Education decisionand theneoconservativedominated commentariat cheered the demise of what it deemed afailed experiment But while busing did great damage in many cities inCharlotte it was widely considered an againsttheodds success That fact makeslast weeks news all the sadder            The landmark Swann suit had its origins inthe  Supreme Court decision known as Brown II  Brown IIgummed up the initial  Brown rulingwhich had decreed segregatedschools unconstitutionalby saying in a nowinfamous oxymoron thatdesegregation should proceed with all deliberate speed By  Charlottehad seen more deliberation than speed Only  percent of black schoolchildrenattended integrated schools To maintain this racial separation  percent ofall students were actually bused to schools far from their homes a form ofbusing that raised no outcry from the white community            With the injustice selfevident the NAACP andother civil rights groups trolled for parents to challenge the system findingVera and Darius Swann The Swanns wanted their yearold son James to attendSeversville Elementary School one of the few integrated schools in the citySeversville Elementary happened to be closest to their home but the schoolboard refused to admit James            The Swanns filed suitbut lost They continued to appeal until their case reached the desk of FederalDistrict Court Judge James McMillan in  The grandson of two confederatesoldiers McMillan was on record deriding the folly  of requiring thatpupils be transported far away from their natural habitat so that someartificial  racial balance be maintained But when he examined the Swanncase he realized that Charlottes school board was plainly in violation of thelaw and that it wasnt going to desegregate unless forced by the courts Theprecedent had been set with the  Supreme Court decision Green vs CountySchool Board of New Kent County  Va in which the court ruled schoolboards had an affirmative duty to ensure racial discrimination would beeliminated root and branch McMillan ordered the Charlotte board to draw up aplan to take stepsnot necessarily busingto do so            At first school board officials refused to implementdesegregation plans and then submitted plans that failed to address theproblem All McMillan could do was reject them After a year of school boardstalling McMillan appointed an outside referee to devise a desegregationstrategy which entailed the busing of black kids to previously white schoolsand vice versa            The buses began rollingon Sept   Enraged many whites protested sometimes violently McMillanreceived death threats and was hanged in effigy The office of the Swannsattorney was fire bombed Black students were beat up at school Some whiteparents withdrew and sent their children to private schools while othersformed citizens groups to agitate against busing            In  the high court unanimously upheld McMillansdecision But the school board split between busing supporters and foescontinued to produce halfhearted integration plans that McMillan had todismiss as not in good faith and busing continued according to the courtsprescription            Meanwhile a previouslyapolitical yearold housewife named Maggie Ray began convening localactivists black and white pro and antibusing to work out an alternativesolutionand also endeared herself to the judge at a backyard barbecue Herinformal committee called the Citizens Advisory Group finagled an endrunaround the school board and persuaded McMillan to put it in charge of thebusing plan In  the board compromised with the committee on anarrangement that won McMillans approval and a year later he withdrew thecourt from supervision of Charlottes desegregation plans trusting thecitizens to do it fairly            After the initial round of white flight Charlottemaintained for the next two decades a mix of roughly  percent white and percent black students The presence of whites especially affluent ones inonce allblack schools lifted those schools quality since white parentscomplaints about outdated textbooks sub par teachers and dilapidatedfacilities were heeded by school officials Blacks test scores rose too aftera special effort led by a probusing superintendent Students parents andlocal officials found new pride in their integrated schools generating moregoodwill Political reform followed too creating a city government that betterrepresented both blacks and poor whites Finally a solid educational systemprovided a foundation for the economic growth the region has recentlyenjoyed            Charlottes busingsuccess hinged on several things Unlike the earlier schemes Rays plan didntexempt the wealthy whites in southeast Charlotte As a result some lowerclasswhites no longer felt singled out to carry the burden of integrationAcknowledging the situations class dimensions blunted the racialanimosityand created a coalition of blacks and less affluent whites Alsothe white flight that doomed busing in Boston and elsewhere was not really anoption Charlottes whites could flee to private schools and some did butbecause the county had consolidated its school system in  the outlyingareas as well as the inner cities were embraced in the busing blueprint A Supreme Court ruling exempted suburban school districts from busingmeaning few metropolises experienced wholesale integrationCharlottestyle            Equally importantand I admit this sounds kind ofcornballsuccess required the civic spiritedness of pro and antibusingparents alike who saw their way clear to hammering out compromises This meantshelving the belief that a single foolproof plan could be implemented once andfor all Citizens got involved with adjusting the busing plan and refightingpainful battles year after year after yeara demanding but inescapableburden The s even saw a major overhaul when Charlotte introduced magnetschools devoted to excellence in a single area such as math and open tostudents from all neighborhoodsto give whites extra incentive to travel longdistances to school            Unfortunately themagnet schools began the undoing of desegregation in Charlotte To remain atool for continued desegregation and not just for excellence the magnetschools had to maintain setasides for black students A newcomer toCharlotteBill Capacchione who had not witnessed the citys efforts in thes to surmount mutual distrustsued to enroll his daughter into a magnetthat officials didnt want to tip all white This year the case came beforeJudge Robert Pottera former Jesse Helms aide a Ronald Reagan appointee anda sworn enemy of busing since he fought against it on the front lines in Calling bused students cogs in an experimental machine Potter declared thatall vestiges of harm wrought by the Jim Crowera dual school system haveevaporated This despite a recent Charlotte Observer study that foundthat without busing segregation would return for more than half of thedistricts students            Charlotte and the nation have come far and we can hopethat integration may someday endure without a conscious effort to preserve itBut its dishonest or naive to claim that that moment has arrived Thirty yearsmay seem like a long time to someone nursing a grievance since the pitchedbattles of the late s but in the sweep of historyon the heels of  yearsof Jim Crow and  of race slaveryits nothing Ironically busing willbecome unnecessary only when no one seems to have a problem with itanymore            Now Charlottes civic leaders and other proponentsof continued desegregation efforts have to reckon with Potters ruling Whilenot carrying the weight of a Supreme Court decision it does point the way forother judges if they want to follow As the city decides in the next weekswhether to appeal it also has to scramble to make sure its denser largelyblack areas will have enough schools to house the kids who cant be busedacross town anymore to less crowded institutions            The most distressing part of Potters decision washis swipe at social experimentation As all great social reformers have knownfixed formulas onesizefitsall policies and judicial fiats rarely solveintractable problems The only thing that does is what FDR called boldpersistent experimentation as the example of Charlotte nobly attests
