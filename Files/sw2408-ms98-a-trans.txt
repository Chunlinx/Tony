          do you have pets   yeah ive got uh three cats uh yeah me and my roommate have a little business on the side and we we breed uh cats yeah its its   three cats i see oh really thats interesting what breed do you do you deal in   well well just about anything we get our hands on right now weve got a uh a Bombay a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian   i see oh my   and uh yeah theyre a lot of fun and were not in it as a business we just we like cats and we decided well if were going to have them we might as well get some purebreds and maybe make a little money on the side   umhum yeah umhum sure yeah yeah ive never never done pets you know as a for breeding purposes ive just you know usually always had a pet of some kind around were at currently we have two cats ive got a big old seventeen pound black male alley cat and ive got a little seven pound tabby cat that we got from the Humane Society shes the cutest little thing then i have a twelve year old Dachshund thats gosh shes one of the family absolutely     yeah yeah a friend of mine had a Dachshund and its same way i mean   yeah yeah shes twelve years old she pretty well you know sets the ground rules for the household   yeah  and the cats listen right  yeah   loves thats right loves the little dog loves to travel of course shes dead asleep before we get to the end of the block and she never you know she sleeps the whole time but she loves to travel         cats of course dont care too much to travel   uh one of mine does the Himalayan Persian the little himmy   umhum   if i take her to the vet i used to put her in her in a cage and take her down but now i just carry her out to the car and she crawls up in my uh up on my shoulder   umhum right umhum umhum umhum   and just watches everything yeah she she enjoys the car   thats amazing yeah weve never had a cat of course like i said i guess the only time ive ever had a cat in the car has been in a carrier maybe maybe if we didnt put them in carriers maybe they would enjoy it more i dont know   probably i think its the carrier that scares them now on the other hand the Bombay hates the car shell uh she   probably so probably so umhum   uh when i bring that cage out she knows whats going to happen  its probably i dont know maybe its the maybe its the thought about the vet that worries her   umhum umhum could be yeah could be yeah that our little tabby cat is the only cat that ive ever seen or had that she absolutely hates to be picked up she would rather just do anything than be picked up more normally you you know you can pick up a cat occasionally anyway she just absolutely hates it i dont know if its   umhum will will she crawl up in your lap yeah some of them some of them are like that they uh they yeah they they dont want to be held but but whenever they want to sit in your lap they want you to be uh open to that yeah   yes she does that but she yeah umhum when she wants to of course umhum umhum umhum thats right yeah she does that thats true thats true   yeah yeah the little Turkish Vans like that pick her up and boy those claws come out and sticks her arms straight out with the claws extended yeah yeah silly silly cat   umhum yes umhum just tense yeah absolutely yeah weve had our our two cats uh declawed because we keep them in the house all the time   yeah   well actually the little gray tabby wanders out in the back yard occasionally i have an eight foot uh security type fence out in the backyard she just kind of goes out and rolls around on the patio and comes back in   umhum yeah   but our black cat has never never once been outside and has no interest in going outside you can actually leave the door open hell come to the door and sit down but he never goes outside   yeah most mine generally stay in the windows theyre theyre   umhum they love to watch the birds um   yeah along the side one side of our house theres nothing but trees and bushes and weve got lots of squirrels and birds and all that around here and they just theyll sit there in that window for hours watching all this   umhum umhum umhum oh yeah they enjoy that umhum thats right just hypnotized yeah   yeah and theyll go to the doors and stand up on the screen door looking out but uh theyre not too interested in going outside i   yeah yeah yeah our little cat just wants wants out maybe once a day thats about all   yeah the Bombay uh actually went through one of the screens last week trying to get out uh so i had to go round her up   hum hum umhum   but uh yeah theyre theyre fun   yeah my wifes a cat person until we married id never really oh wed had a cat occasionally you know and left it outside most of the time we lived in kind of a rural area my wifes a real cat person one time not when we were together but at one time she had a total of like seventeen cats   umhum um sounds like my next door neighbor   yeah boy i try to keep her away from the Humane Society she always want to bring something home you know yeah   oh thats my problem ill go down to the uh SPCA or the Humane shelter and i i feel so sorry for them and i just want to i want to bring them all home   umhum yeah thats what she does yeah thats right   its so pathetic to see them down there   yes it really is   im just uh it irritates me the way people mistreat animals and and they dont do it intentionally they just theyre just doing it they go out and they think oh wouldnt it be cute to get a kitty   umhum umhum get a kitten yeah umhum   and they go out and they dont have it fixed or anything and it has kittens and they cant support it and they take them down there and they end up getting   thats right umhum thats right or move off and leave them   or move off and leave them and they they end i dont know where this one the my next door neighbor had a had a dead cat next to his front porch yeah id seen the cat around here before i thought it belonged to somebody but i have no idea what killed it   umhum oh gosh umhum yeah good grief may have been poisoned or something   it might have been might have gotten hold of something bad or it we had a cold snap here not too long ago it may have frozen out there i i sort of doubt it cats know how to take care of themselves   yeah umhum could be could be umhum no not if theyve never been out in any weather i wouldnt think so especially   yeah well this this one was definitely outdoor cat because i saw him all the time and i suspect somebody had just had him and moved off   umhum yeah co uld be yeah that thats too bad it really is it is   its its sad i mean and they do it to dogs   absolutely yeah umhum   the last dog i got i think was that way because he was uh he was in fairly good shape but apparently just didnt have a home or couldnt find his way home and i dont believe it because he was one smart dog strange mixture he was uh   umhum umhum right umhum umhum   the best i can figure he was part Lab because he had a Lab head   umhum   uh and definitely part Grayhound uh bloodhound because he had these head big old jowls had the bloodhound mouth but he had the soft bite of a Lab   bloodhound yeah umhum umhum   and he was the smartest dog ive ever seen he just i could talk to him and he knew what i was saying   yeah umhum yeah they they are smart they really are right next door or my neighbor across the street has a couple of Labs theyre really nice dogs they really are   umhum well my my brother raises my brother raises Labs and he gave one to uh he gave one to me several years ago   i see umhum   and she was she was just the sweetest little thing but they love to chew and so after she had chewed up my my redwood furniture   umhum umhum yeah yes ive seen that   uh she chewed the corners off the picnic table and chewed cross members off chairs   yes ive had a German Shepherd that did that one time   yeah oh i ended up getting her a six foot two by four and let and she had the best time with it   umhum i bet she did   shed grab that thing in the middle and it was just about as heavy as she was and shed drag that thing around the yard  she was a sight to behold   umhum umhum  that was cheap entertainment wasnt it yeah   it was its so easy to entertain them   it really is our kids are all grown and gone and away from home so our our new family is the you know our two cats and our dog we never really well we had we did have some time to devote to them you know but not nearly as much time as we have now so theyve really become children theyre theyre real characters they really well all of them are   yeah yeah well theyre enjoyable to to have around i i uh i run a little business out of the house here and uh im usually alone   oh yeah they are umhum umhum umhum   and got all these cats around so they they keep me occupied well they   umhum they keep you entertained they sure do we have a uh my wifes uh mother is uh oh about  seventy seven i guess she really gets a thrill when we go over to see her and bring the dog i think shes more happy to see the dog than she is us       i cant get it cant get her convinced that she really shouldnt try to feed my dog chocolate though she always wants to do a little Hershey Kisses you know you really shouldnt feed chocolate to a dog especially a small dog     no no they they  get get her a get her a box of doggy biscuits to to to let her feed him   so i kind of have to watch her when shes around the dog yeah i guess so yeah some for some reason she just really thinks that little dog needs some chocolate of course the dog thinks so too     well of course Dachshunds and Dachshunds like chocolate i i remember i remember that other one too he was always after somebodys chocolate bar   they do as a matter of fact they do umhum umhum yeah they love it they really do   my my cats dont think much of chocolate course theyre so theyre so damn finicky anyway   no oh yeah absolutely   its   i think they can read the price tag on the cans of food   yeah well they do well it it we found out that didnt work because we even even bought the expensive stuff and they looked at it like youve got to be kidding like you know what are you a fool paying that much money for this     umhum yeah now i think ive experienced my first cat here that will not eat tuna we have a cat that will not eat tuna umhum   ive got ive ive got one that wont doesnt even like anything with fish in it   yeah thats strange umhum   yeah actually actually you know fish is not their natural food thats thats the   yeah i thought yeah thats true   people i dont know why i guess the cartoons and everything people grow up believing cats like fish the only reason they go after fish in a fishbowl is because its moving its something something to play with   umhum yeah thats right thats right yeah i believe this is the first cat that ive ever had that would not even consider eating tuna   i bet it likes chicken though   oh yeah absolutely and even beef as a matter of fact in small quantities   yeah every one of mine yeah yeah even mine love chicken when i get in when i yeah when i get in there to fry chicken or something theyre all standing around waiting because they know theyre going to get a piece   umhum oh yeah they love love chicken umhum umhum thats right  well Jeff its been good talking to you   i just i usually yeah okay well its been fun you have a good day   yeah yeah take care of those cats all right byebye   yeah thanks a lot byebye
