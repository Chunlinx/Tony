        okay are are you an exercise fanatic   are you well im sort of an exercise fanatic im big on swimming   oh really   yeah   well thats way north too i guess you have to swim inside huh   yeah i uh i i i find i do more swimming in the wintertime than i do in the summer   really   yeah   wow   uh my wife has a sailboat so i wind up on the sailboat a lot in the summertime   umhum   but its the winter months that i can get serious about swimming   oh well thats good thats thats one of the best ones i understand no stress on the joints   well it winds up being a little stress on the shoulder joints after a while   yeah i guess so but as far as the weight bearing   yeah well i find that uh if i want to lose some weight that uh i cant do it unless i exercise as well   yeah thats true plus even if you lose weight and dont exercise it ends up just looking you know looking unhealthy   yeah well last year i had a campaign to lose about uh twenty pounds and uh i wound up swimming about three hundred and sixty miles during the year   wow do you swim like at a at a Y or   yes uh Fairfax County has uh a number of uh park authority uh recreation centers and all of them have uh at least a twenty five meter or twenty five yard uh swimming pool   oh   and in fact out here in Oakton we have uh theres a fifty meter uh pool called Oakmar and its sort of a uh uh a landmark pool its a very uh excellent design you know top rated pool   hm   and good uh gallery facilities for competitive uh events and things like that   really is it like Olympic size   its Olympic size yes   wow are you are you a TI employee   no i uh work for ESystems   what   which is which is another Dallas company       but im at the uh Melpar division here in uh Falls Church   yeah well the reason i ask you i im a TI employee and uh we have a fitness center you know thats on site   hum   that makes it real real convenient because i tend to find that once i get home thats it you know   yeah   i tend to not want to go anywhere after that but this way you know you can go to the fitness center right from work and they have aerobics and you know all this machines and all that sort of stuff were not were not high rollers like Dallas we dont have a pool but   yeah yeah well i have we have a uh recreation center which is almost right across the street from our uh office   oh thats good   and so i hit there at seven oclock in the morning get in a half hour swim and still make it to work on time   oh thats great yeah morning is usually a better time to exercise but i usually find that after work is when i have the time to do it   um well i get to put work after work i i have to hurry home and uh and help out with the kids and   you have honeydews yeah   fix things around the house and all those kind of chores   honeydews   so the morning hour is my time to myself   yeah well thats great i i like to to work out some in the morning but its not like  you know i usually use the video or something like that to do   oh you   plus i like to dance you know   oh you do the aerobic uh dancing then   umhum umhum and and on Saturdays i go to a jazzercise class thats my   yeah well that looks that looks like so much work to me i   oh its fun jazzercise is really fun   yeah but you put out a lot of energy uh keeping up that pace   yeah there theres a lot of energy i i i like to belly dance too but theres not the same you know you dont get the aerobic   yeah   workout as much but jazzercise is what its its so much fun that you forget youre exercising you know aerobics you dont forget   hum     you know youre exercising oh and we started the bench aerobics too i dont know if youve seen that   i havent seen that no   thats a fairly new thing its just like uh one step   yeah   you know its like a box and you just step up and down and up and down and up down do different variations you know change feet and and youd be surprised how quick that gets the pulse rate up   oh okay   its a its a lot quicker and and that way its completely low impact heres no jumping or you know no jarring on the knee bones   yeah i i see some of these exercise machines that uh it looks like youre constantly walking up stairs   yeah uhhuh   and uh i think that should get your heart rate right up there at the maximum and keep it there   yeah that will do it yeah we have one of those too but its boring   yeah yeah i can see that well i a lot of people complain about swimming that thats uh boring   oh but that wouldnt be boring like walking up stairs   but i find that uh over over the years ive developed the ability to keep track of my uh workout and at the same time uh do some creative thinking while im swimming   yeah   so i i can write letters to congressman and uh organize reports and uh   right well do you count your laps or do you just have a time segment that you   i i count them i i swim a sixteen fifty every day and uh so thats sixty six lengths of the pool   jeez   and uh i sometimes i may not be conscious of keeping count but uh you know every now and then when i do check up and say where is my count i check it relative to the clock and and i also wind up coming out even  even side of the pool   yeah yeah well thats neat do you do you look forward to doing it or do you sometimes have to force yourself until you get started   i usually uh  look forward to it uh and in fact some mornings i uh almost feel a necessity   yeah   to uh to get out and uh go for the swim i think uh there is something to this endorphins   yeah   uh thing but uh when im exercising regularly i i feel the need to to do more exercise   umhum and then when you dont for some reason you feel real lethargic   yeah     it seems like  like the the the less you exercise the tireder you are im sorry   umhum   yeah yeah thats true sometimes i find i have to kick myself though to get started and once i get started you know its it feels good   and yeah well sometimes sometimes uh ive had the effect that if i swim in the morning uh i get an urge to go back and swim again at lunch time   wow do you have time to do that in your job   and just barely it amounts to running out the back door and uh heading for the pool jumping in swimming some sprints or something like that and then running back again   course you probably i have i have waist length hair so you probably dont have that problem   yeah     you know thats a problem with with getting getting that much wet   umhum   but   well ive ive lost most of my hair so thats no real problem   oh   then nobody really complains if i uh if i come in sort of half wet   yeah well gee well that sounds neat and you do that like like almost every day or what about weekends   almost every day i uh this spring has been uh a little hard to keep up the pace because uh weve had a lot of family activities my wife has taken up skiing   oh   and uh she she twisted   water skiing or snow skiing   snow skiing she did water skiing when she was uh young   oh umhum   and uh i think she was uh pretty competitive at one point she had a bad accident that uh put her out of competition   oh really   uh but shes taking up snow skiing and she got me involved   oh thats good exercise   so i was out there you know stark terror coming down the side of the hill   God really   and we had another expedition where we took the three little kids up and uh taught them to ski   how how old are your kids are they   and uh seven eight and ten   oh thats a good age to start something like that   yeah it was it was delightful watching them uh learn they uh they went out with their individual personalities and picked it up in their own little way   umhum   uh the one we thought would be the most timid uh turned out to be the one that stuck with it and was the first to learn   really   and the other two got jealous and they went out and says well im going to go and do it too so  so they learned too   little competition there   and uh we went to a good resort and the instructors were there uh took a liking to the kids so next thing you know theyre theyve got the kids off on the uh some of the bigger slopes   really did they have a separate uh like class or something for the kids or is it everybody together   the place where we went has a separate area for beginners its called the Sun Bowl   umhum   and they just put instructors out there and you you sign up for instruction and they just give you an arm band and if you see an instructor whos not doing anything you just tap him on the shoulder and ask him questions and theyll show you things   oh   and so theyre pretty much available all day long   umhum   and you can either take instruction or practice or or just enjoy yourself whatever you like   yeah   and the instructors are very enthusiastic and of course they picked up the kids and and took them on some of the more advanced slopes   yeah did you all start this year or last year   uh yes my wife did some last year   umhum   and got started and so she grabbed me by the ear and made me do it this year     do you all have have you had a good snow this year   we were lucky um we were going to Seven Springs up in Pennsylvania and the first time we went up there the instructor said that was the first uh really good weekend that theyd had this year   really   and uh Charlotte went up in the uh middle of the season
