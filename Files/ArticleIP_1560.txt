if Clinton had lied about the affair but not committed a moreserious offense he could avert impeachment by admitting to it apologizingand pouring his heart out to the American people The conventional

been turned over to prosecutors The otherpurported physical evidence of a relationshipthe tapes of Clinton talking toLewinskys answering machinereportedly are innocuous White House aides arehappy Clinton remains high in the polls but are surprised by the disclosure ofthe dress and worry that it will turn the public against him The big questionsnow are  Did the dress actually contain Clintons DNA  Did Lewinskylaunder the dress and if so did that destroy the evidence  Will Starrwithhold the DNA test results in order to set an additional perjury trap forClinton when he testifies Aug  For
