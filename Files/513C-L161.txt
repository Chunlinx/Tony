              SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY      June        Dear Colleague      Several School of Dentistry faculty and staff members have recently      asked how they can become members of the Century Club The Club is made      up of alumni faculty staff and friends who support the school with      annual gifts of  or more I believe many of the questions are being      asked because the Campaign for Indiana IUs major fundraising effort      that started in  is ending and many who supported IUSD through the      campaign are wondering how they can continue their support      Payroll deduction is perhaps the easiest way to make a contribution      For example with a  biweekly or  monthly contributon a person can      be a Century Club member And if a person decides to be a contributor      the best time to begin is the month prior to salary increases This      allows donors to adjust their budget without losing any money they are      already receiving I guess I encourage this method because Ive always      made my contributions this way its a painless method and at tax time      I enjoy the deduction      In  we had  Century I and Century II members we would like to      have  members by the end of  If you would like to help us reach      our goal we have enclosed a pledge card for your convenience Please      return it to Joyce Stafford or me Development Office Room  so that      we can personally thank you for your support You will also receive a      letter from Dean Gilmore expressing his appreciation      Over the past few years weve been able to make many improvements that      would not have been possible without the generosity and backing of the      Century Club Support from the Century Club helps us continue to provide      a progressive learning and working environment for our students faculty      and staff I thank all of you who are already supporting IUSD and I look      forward to welcoming many of our colleagues as new century Club      members      If you have any questions please feel free to stop by and see me      Sincerely      Danny R Dean Director of Development
