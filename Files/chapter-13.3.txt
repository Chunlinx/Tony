obtains the information                from him through two unidentified intermediaries one of whom merely delivers the                information to the Service The same source claims that the

 NSA began placing caveats on all of its Bin Ladin reports that                precluded sharing of any of the reports contents with criminal prosecutors or FBI                agents investigating criminal matters without first obtaining OIPRs permission                These caveats were initially created at the direction of Attorney General Reno and                applied solely to reports of information gathered from three specific surveillances                she had authorized Because NSA decided it was administratively too difficult to                determine whether particular reports derived from the specific surveillances                authorized by the attorney general NSA decided to place this caveat on all its                terrorismrelated reports In November  in response to direction from the FISA                Court NSA modified these caveats to require that consent for sharing the                information with prosecutors or criminal agents be obtained

         In early May  the CIA received intelligence that Bin Ladin might be                leaving Sudan Though this reporting was described as very spotty it would have                been passed along to the DCIs office because of high concern about Bin Ladin at the                time But it did not lead to plans for a US operation to snatch Bin Ladin because                there was no indictment against him Ron interview Mar   Frank interview                Mar   It appears however that if another country had been willing to                imprison Bin Ladin the CIA might have

Berger told us that he saw no                chance that Sudan would have handed Bin Ladin over and also noted that in  the                US government still did not know of any al Qaeda attacks on US citizens Samuel                Berger interview Jan              Alleged Sudanese offers to cooperate on counterterrorism have been the subject of                much recent controversy After repeatedly demanding that Sudan stop supporting                terrorist groups in  the US government designated the country a state sponsor                of terrorism Diplomatic discussions continued but had little impact on Sudanese                support for terrorism or on other issues such as human rights In the fall of                 the United States conducted a Sudan policy review and supported by a vocal segment                of Congress the White House sought to pressure and isolate the Sudanese Susan Rice                interview Jan              After Bin Ladin left Sudan in May  some State Department officials including                Ambassador Carney criticized the NSCs hardline policy which he felt provided no                carrots for Sudanese moderates to cooperate on counterterrorism He also faulted                the NSC for not reopening the US embassy in Khartoum closed in early  when                security concerns there were reevaluated States Sudan desk officer agreed noting                that the embassy was an excellent vehicle for gathering information on terrorists                According to one State official NSC policymakers views were too firmly set to                engage and test the Sudanese on counterterrorism Timothy Carney interview Dec                 David Shinn interview Aug   Stephen Schwartz interview Dec                  But supporters of the tough line such as the NSCs Susan Rice argued that                any conciliatory statements from Khartoum belied its unhelpful actions For example                she noted though Sudan did eventually expel Bin Ladin his al Qaeda network                retained a presence in the country Susan Rice interview Jan   In                addition the CIAs Africa Division whose operatives had engaged the Sudanese on                counterterrorism in early  would conclude that there is no indication that                Sudanese involvement with terrorism has decreased in the past year They saw the                Sudanese gestures toward cooperating as tactical retreats aimed at deceiving                Washington in hopes of having sanctions removed CIA memo Walter

occasions told us the Sudanese were not going to deliver and the perceived                moderates were just flatout lying Mark interview May              In February  the Sudanese sent letters to President Clinton and Secretary of                State Albright extending an invitation for a US counterterrorism inspection                mission to visit Sudan The Sudanese also used private US citizens to pass along                offers to cooperate Mansoor Ijaz interview May   Janet McElligot interview                Oct   But these offers were dismissed because the NSC viewed Sudan as all                talk and little action US officials also feared that the Sudanese would exploit                any positive American responses including trips to the region by US officials
