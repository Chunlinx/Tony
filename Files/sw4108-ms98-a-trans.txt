        okay   okay   um so what do you think um about putting an elderly in a nursing home   well i think that it it varies on on the individual basis   hm   uh sometimes it is theres no alternative uh you do not have uh   umhum   uh family available or family thats uh you may not even have family that is uh in and who around   thats true yeah   so sometimes its not an alternative and i think uh but i think also sometimes it can be uh a benefit if its for a short time sometimes in a nursing home   hm umhum   um especially after if its after an acute illness to get over a uh or to rehab after uh an illness   thats true i never thought of that yeah   sometimes you know it sometimes the nursing homes are good for uh just short periods of time   thats true until they get over that hump of whatever it is theyre dealing with   umhum because too often the acute hospitals will are sending them out much faster than what theyre really able to   yes they really are they dont like to keep them longer than a week   but so so there is some good to it uh sometimes too its used as a dumb job you know the families well the families do not necessarily   yeah what do you mean   uh know what to do with them and they dont wanna take the responsibility so they will put them in a nursing home   yeah thats true   so you see uh theres both sides to it too what do you think   yeah and it depends on how how sick the person is too and what youre capable of like if you have a family to take care of you know of your own   yeah   yeah um  i would personally like it if my parents were to get ill i would like to take care of them at home and if i had the money with some help thats not always possible   thats true   but um to the best of my ability id like to do it until it gets impossible   well i think thats also where youre gonna to have a lot of people who are going to its theres not a choice its because there its not economically feasible even to put them in a nursing home   right umhum  yeah   so that that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the uh either Medicare or insurance to cover it   thats true yeah   so   but i think nursing homes can be good just depends on what kind they are you know an you need to check them out ahead of time   yeah and then theres also some that are set up for specialties uh   umhum   i know some elderly unfortunately some elderly have to go to or  have i guess its Alzheimers or where they wander or or um   umhum   confused or have some mental problems   yeah that theyre   and you need a special nursing home for that you need one that has a unit thats locked where they are not able to get out and roam around and you need people who are trained for that type of problem   yeah right and know what theyre doing with that   yeah so so theres different types of nursing homes i think   yeah well my uh grandmothers not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it and she really liked the idea of of moving there shes not ill yet   umhum   but um she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years and then she decided that um shes eighty five years old that eventually you know she she doesnt want her family taking care of her and being a burden shes very independent so shes in this nursing home its out in the country and um she really enjoys it right now because she doesnt have to wash dishes or cook   gives her a little bit of her own independence but she still has uh a security there   uhhuh right some support and then theres also a sort of a wing for those people that do get sick and what i like about it and i think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now and then so if she ever does become ill um itll be like family around her   thats right and i ive seen some of them like that too and also they have a lot of uh activities going on for the ones who are more active   yeah umhum yeah she   so its not sort of like uh uh a sick place   umhum no she loves it she had a great social life and she travels and um its in in Missouri in the in the mountains and its beautiful and uh  i i hope that i have something like that when i get older   yeah i think i think of the um i think the the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the the uh elderly uh person whos going in   umhum   and the family thats going to be uh effected effected by it   oh definitely its   and uh you know sometimes it can those choices those choices can be made in advance and sometimes the choices uh because of the nature of the illness when theyre   umhum right
