life of DarkAlliance As one Web surfer noted The outrage of the freshly exposed readersis refreshing to see Gary Webb himself joined the fray on the MercuryCenters Reader Forum and was clearly energized by his online fans His firstposting dated Aug  reads thus Since Ive been living with this story forso long it ceased to shock me long ago Im glad to see it still has somepunch This was mild compared with his Sept  attack on a lone Web surfer whoraised questions about proof of CIA involvement Thats like saying theresno proof of General Motors involvement in making Chevrolet Webb raged Ialso heard a great line while I was doing a radio show in Florida yesterdayNow we know what CIA really stands forCrack In America            The feedback on the Web and on radio talk shows fed eachother creating an alternative media alliance that shouted down the objectionsof the mainstream press and catapulted the series to national prominence Angerat the mainstream media overwhelms anger at the government in many of theseforums How long will Koppel and co dance away from this one asked oneInternet chatter Blackoriented radioshow hosts repeatedly plugged theMercury News Web site in their broadcasts and it became in the wordsof Richard Prince of the National Association of Black Journalists the buzzof Black America From there political leaders like Sen Barbara Boxer andthe NAACPs Kweisi Mfume began calling for investigations and the mainstreampress was forced to write metastories with headlines like this one from theOct  New York Times  Though Evidence is Thin Tale of CIA and DrugsHas Life Of Its Own Other news sites and respected political organizationslike the NAACP began to link to the series            Thewidespread attention merely fueled the us vs them sentiment of most Internetdiscussions on the topic When Ceppos wrote his apologetic column he wasmerely saying what they had been saying all along Granted there may beinconsistencies there may be fallacies but why not take up the banner oftruth and march on argues one Webhead The impact of the Internet has beentwofold Not only has it allowed the series to leapfrog the mainstream pressbut it has also made the mainstream press as much the enemy as the CIA Thefact that Ceppos has defected to the dark side merely fuels the fire
