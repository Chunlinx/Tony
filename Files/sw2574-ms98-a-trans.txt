                well whats your views on it   i personally feel like as long as the Soviet Union exists its going to be a threat to the United States and   sure an anybody thats got that much military might is going to be a threat   thats right and i i think that weve made a lot of strides in the last several years with them but i dont feel like that we can ever turn our back on them and   not yet   no i i just think that   course were in a good position theyre theyre quite dependent on us right now   yeah   but that doesnt necessarily mean anything but i dont know the i   and i i have to wonder sometimes how much of their dependence is um you  know if its its sort of a false dependence just to while theyre building their own uh way of doing things that theyre making us think that they depend that much on us so that we dont watch them more closely you know im very suspicious of them   well i dont know i yeah i mean first and foremost i mean everybody loves Gorby but you know that the one thing they have to keep in mind hes a communist and communists have their own little ideology about the way things are going to be     yeah thats right   i think i think theyre in pretty bad shape right now i i think their i think their reliance on us is is probably real course thats not to say that once we get them on their feet again things wont go back the way they were   thats right   so i dont know   and i dont know you know they they want to know what it would take to convince us that they arent a threat and i dont know that theres anything that can be done to convince us of that because you know we just see how if if you let your guard down in any situation how you know how quickly that Persian Gulf situation arose   uhhuh   um i dont i i dont think that that we can ever be convinced as a country that that theyre going to change or you know not be a threat   well only unless they change their form of government   yeah and even even the strides that were made toward that though uh you know Gorbachev seems to have       he seems to have lost his steam in in that direction and you know he seems to be repressing his own people again and i dont think that i think that a lot of the the forward progress that was made came to a halt you know in the middle of that Persian Grulf Gulf crisis   uhhuh uhhuh well its going to be interesting in the next few years to see what happens because theres quite a strong democratic um um   group over there   yeah see so many of them have gotten a taste of of democracy and   theyre kind of in between right now theyre theyre not uh theyre not getting the benefits of being a democratic place but they they know what they are and uh the country tells them that you know this is what its like to be a democracy and theyre still hurting   umhum uhhuh   so you know theyre getting i guess the worst of all worlds right now   um yeah well there was a interesting cartoon in the editorial the other day it was a there was a picture of a shop keeper with this really mean look on his face and empty shelves in back of him and a little rat and a couple of spider webs and   uh   a couple of Russians walk in and look at it and say well we have the worst of both worlds communism and capitalism   thats true     but you know i i i think that i think or at least i hope that they understood thats what was going to happen now you cant go from a a communist economy to a democratic one and expect things to be great overnight   right   its just like Poland   and East Germany   and East Germany i mean the the only saving grace for East Germany is that West Germany had lots of money   yeah thats right   and uh theyre bailing them out on everything but even even now the West Germans are grumbling   uhhuh   you know which i i would hope they had thought about that while they were busily engaged in tearing down the wall i mean they talk about unification unification and now theyre unified and now all they can do is gripe   right uhhuh   but oh well i dont know   its one of those things that all looks good on paper but putting it into reality is a whole different ball game   yeah yeah i know we weve shoveled so much aid to Poland and i dont know of course you dont hear hear the bad things out of there like you used to but it doesnt mean theyre not going on it just means the press decided to cover something else   thats true thats right yeah   of course you know you always wonder about the information youre getting anyway   thats right i you know thats another thing the news media in the in the Soviet Union i wouldnt trust them either you know i wouldnt trust them to send to send a story about the United States to their people correctly   huhuh huhuh huhuh   and uh   there has been a lot more openness   yeah   um we can only hope that that continues its a precursor of things to come   i think our next biggest threat is the Japanese Japanese   yeah yeah first economic battle weve ever been involved in   yeah   yeah its like our car industry and it would have it would it would have gone under a long time ago if it hadnt have been for the Japanese helping us out   yeah   and i guess they they feel a bit ashamed theyve done so well   yeah   well heres the poor United States they helped us get on our feet so lets help them       its amazing we got a lot of problems here too i do mean   yeah and and and i have a real problem with the government you know giving away things to the the other countries that have as as much ability to to do harm to us as anyone   uhhuh   and you know like giving them plans plans for the some of the uh top secret aircraft that we have and things like that i mean thats ridiculous that is only asking for trouble   yeah well its like its like Saddam you know were going to build them up and then have to go in there and take care of them   yeah   so   thats  exactly right   well gosh i cant think of anything else   nope me either   well i guess thatll about do it   okay  same here have a good weekend byebye   good talking to you you too byebye
