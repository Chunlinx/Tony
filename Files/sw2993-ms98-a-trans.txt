                are you in the market for a car recently   yeah i just bought a car   oh whatd you get   i got a nineteen eighty three Cavalier station wagon   uhhuh what what convinced you to get that one   well a a friend of my fathers and hed driven it all over the country and it runs great   umhum oh incredible how many miles on it   its like it has a hundred and fifty three thousand   and its still running real well   yeah   oh great yeah we have um right now we have two cars um i have my husband and myself we have two sons who are drivers   umhum   and one of which is a um an eighty eight Plymouth Voyager Van and then we have um about a year ago we picked up a second hand uh uh Audi   umhum   uh and uh that was a car you know a car a sedan and uh we got that i dont ill the major things the reason why we got that is we had had a Nova and a well my son was driving and someone came into his lane and hit him and fortunately he was able to his i mean he was checked out of the hospital was out of the hospital by that night but the car was completely totaled   umhum   and Mike and they had been my sons two sons had been a passenger in a car about a year and a half before that which was hit by another car   um   so i mean i got i was getting really nervous so i finally said we i want a really solid car so we found the Audi second hand i guess right now my criteria for cars is uh uh solid being solid able to take an impact   right   and uh so uh i were not going to be in the market for in the near future for any new car     umhum   but the the things that i would want would be a solid car another thing id definitely want would be antilock brakes   right   uh our our van which is a a delight to drive does not have i i think the brakes on the Plymouth van is just are terrible   hm   um if the road is at all wet and im and i dont go all that fast but the uh it it just doesnt hold it doesnt hold well at all so uh i i definitely would want to get antilock brakes so i dont know uh do you have any particular things that that are priorities on your list   well its i didnt really need power windows but it has power you know windows and steering and air conditioning and and uh   yeah i guess down there air conditionings a must isnt it   umhum oh yeah it it has a stereo and a cassette player and um it hes told me it gets forty two miles to gallon   uhhuh thats incredible that is incredible   umhum so   uh we we get about our the uh van gets on highways can get about twenty eight the Audi does not have good mileage thats the one drawback its a powerful car   umhum   um but it does not uh i mean i if im on a highway and i can get twenty twenty one miles in per gallon i consider that lucky im lucky maybe maybe sometimes ive gotten twenty two it comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving and thats a to me is a real drawback i wish i would you know i could settle for twenty eight or   umhum   but uh the um the frills on that car are nice but theyre not necessary for me except air conditioning in this area uh in Washington DC area it gets hot and humid   umhum really umhum its really humid   yeah uh so air conditioning is definitely uh definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer um but i um i i dont need uh you know power windows are nice but i dont need them   right   although i must say when youre driving in the east and there are all these toll roads come into a toll road push that button down its real nice for that window to zip down and zip up instead of having to crank it     umhum crank yeah umhum   yeah but or you know if you want to have open windows to be able to open if youre alone in the car just to press buttons and but you know ive lived all these years without them i probably could have lived a little longer   right   you dont have to stretch thats true   uh one of the things that we have uh weve liked when weve gotten a new car and this this used car has it is a sun roof   umhum   and those are really nice in in good weather   thats right   so uh so i guess if we get a new car it definitely would have to have antilock antilock brakes id love to get uh an air bag   umhum   and a sun roof and uh just so itd be a good solid car i guess thats those are my my major criteria everything else is you know a luxury and they make the car more expensive but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong     right   so uh but if you were to buy a new car now a brand new car what would you look for   um yeah like you said antilock brakes and air bag and uh id id really like to have a car thats dependable   umhum yeah yeah   that that you drive you know like a   American made car thats as dependable as Mercedes or something you know thats   isnt that true its its funny um uh that you use uh the Audis German and i have to say it has been pretty dependable   umhum   yeah sometimes one advantage of an American made car is if you get stuck anywhere most local garages can fix you up   yeah they have parts uhhuh   but once you get if you start once you get something fancy you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really and the parts i know the Audi parts are terribly expensive   right umhum   i i mean it just i shudder i would not get the Audi again just for that reason but i would love i wish an American an American that you know engineering would make something as solid as a German car you know we certainly have the technology but its amazing when we bought this Audi i mean everything is more solid in it     right   uh it you dont feel youve got any of the flabby plastic   umhum   and i know and i i and im willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a for a solid car i dont think i have to give up as much as im giving up   right   but uh do you need air conditioning down there   yes we really do because even today its its supposed to get up into the nineties so   yeah oh weve had eleven days in a row over ninety     umhum   theyve in fact had to excuse school down here because of that   oh   well listen i enjoyed talking with you   it was nice talking to you   okay and enjoy enjoy your car   yeah have a nice summer     thank you you too its going to be a hot one okay byebye   yeah bye
