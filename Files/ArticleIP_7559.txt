                                 The Golden Fleece            In the s the spectrumof fabric quality ran from beloved natural fibers down to mediocre cottonpolyblends then dipped into trashiness with pure polyester Today polyester fleeceis the uniform of hikers climbers backpackers college kids and people whowant to look like them As in the s youre nothing in the s if yourenot in polyesterpreferably polyester from Patagonia The North Face MarmotREI or LL Bean            Dontwrite this off as a mere fashion fad Polyester is undergoing a renaissancebecause fleece is truly a miracle fabric Its warm and durable butlightweight and it dries faster than natural fibers At the same time itfeels natural to the touch not scratchy like the poly of yore And whilefleece takes over the sweater and sweat shirt market other synthetic fabricsare horning in on the long underwear business with equally good reasonPolypropylene and other newer polyester blends beat out cotton for keeping yourskin dry and warm In short in high performance clothing fake is great            Fleece is a  percent polyester fabric thats made liketerry cloth First a machine knits the fleece leaving tiny loops on itssurface then the fabric is treated in three ways  Napping Machines smackthe fleece with tiny wires that break the loops  Combing The strands offleece are groomed to stand up crew cut straight thereby creating airtrappingspace The trapped air creates warmth  Shearing The upright strands areshorn to a uniform height which stops the strands from getting tangled up likedreadlocks a problem that leads to pilling            All thismanufacturing goes on not at Patagonia or The North Face or any of theircompetitorsthese companies just design and sew the garments The fleece usedin high end outdoor clothing is made by two textile firms Malden Mills andDyersburg the Coke and Pepsi of fleece Malden Mills holds a near monopoly onhigh performance fleece to find out why its a monopoly you can love click while Dyersburg feasts on the leftovers By all accounts both mills producesuperb fabric            So is all fleece basically the same It is ifyoure the kind of shopper who only buys premium brands Otherwise you have tocontend with cheap Asian imports People I talked to at Malden and Dyersburgcomplained mightily about shoddy Asian fleece flooding the market andundercutting them In this case theres a good reason to buy American MostAsian fleece has been napped but it hasnt been combed or sheared Thus  Itssubpar air trapping begets a pitiful warmthtoweight ratio and  it tends topill Some Asian fleece will even pillhorrorsbefore it leaves the salesrack You can test this by rubbing the fleece with your palm To be fair theAmericans admit that Asian fleece has made great strides but the West is stillbest            Asianfleece is mostly relegated to downmarket brandsthe name Kmart was floatedby one Malden spokeswoman The top brands proudly announce that they use Maldentrademark Polartec   or  or Dyersburg trademark ECO orDyertech All except for Patagonia that is which pretends its Synchillafleece is something else Despite costing more and supposedly being betterPatagonias fleece is from Malden and Dyersburg just like everyone elses Iftheres some other difference between them I dont know about it becausedespite many phone calls and emails Patagonia refused to answer my questionson this point            Why not buy the cheapest gear you can find that usesAmerican fleece Because design makes a difference Compare Campmors Polartec  jacket with The North Faces  Denali jacket also featuringPolartec  Both use the same fabric Maldens excellent heaviest weightfleece There are three good reasons to pay  more for the Denali and onesoso one  The Denali has a nylon shell over its torso improving windresistance  The Denali has more pockets with zipper closures  The Denalihas flaps behind the zippers in its armpit vents all hightech jackets havezippered armpit vents while the Campmor has no flaps so cold seeps through The cool North Face logo and jacket cut will impress your gearhead friendsmore than the budget Campmor logo and cut            To testthe designs of these and two other popular fleece tops I went to DukeUniversitys zoology department where many walkin refrigerators and freezersare to be found The entrants in my little competition were the Campmor theNorth Face the Marmot ECO vest  fleece made by Dyersburg from recycledplastic soda bottles and the Patagonia Synchilla SnapT  the itfleeceof the prepschool Phishfan set            Dukes walkin fridge runs a cool  degreesFahrenheit With a long sleeve polypropylene Tshirt as a base layer more onthat later I wore each fleece in the fridge for about  minutes The Marmotvest performed best keeping my torso toasty but of course leaving my armsquite cold The other fleeces would have been plenty warm during exercise butstanding still I felt a bit chilly The North Face did a fine job here whilethe Campmor faced the aforementioned armpit zipper problem The Patagonia hadtwo drawbacks While in calm conditions the SnapT was the warmest of theentrants it was especially nonwindresistant the fridge had a fan That wasin part because it had no nylon lining but it was still less windresistantthan other competitors without a lining Also the Patagonia had no pockets formy handsa shocking oversight            Next I ventured into thefreezer a chilling minus  degrees Fahrenheit None of the fleeces came closeto weathering this kind of cold An outer layer is clearly necessary in theseconditions even when youre vigorously exercising which I tried to do in thefreezer until I quickly became lightheaded from the icy air            Overallwinner The North Face Denali jacket with a great design but at  thehighest price tag by far Sometimes you get what you pay for            General conclusion Look for designs that minimize fleecesweaknesses Fleeces Achilles heel is that without a nylon coating it lacksany wind resistancea slight breeze that wool and cotton would turn back cutsright through fleece with a nasty bite Two other weaknesses of fleece to keepin mind  If you fall onto a nubby carpet while wearing fleece as I didintentionally the fleece gets irreparable bald spots at the impact pointsThis is especially relevant to all the childrens fleece being sold nowtykesare prone to carpet falls  Fleece easily melts even when exposed for lessthan a second to the flame of a cigarette lighter            The thingsto look for are a good fit an attractive look a nylon shell and ample andamply sized pockets Fleece makers offer a few other options Shearling fleecelooks more like sheeps wool with a pebbly texture Instead of being shearedshearlings strands are coaxed into clumps Some think the resulting nookscreate better insulation and wind resistance I didnt try shearling but noone I spoke with recommended it Another option is to blend spandex with fleeceto make it stretchier and more formfitting Malden does this with itsPowerstretch fabrics available in The North Faces Aurora vest among otherproducts            Now that fleece is the insulation of choiceother fake fabrics have grown popular as base layers Synthetic longunderwear used to be made of polypropylene some of it still is The advantagewas that polypropylene dried much faster than cotton spreading sweat acrossthe fabric to increase the sweats surface area and speed up evaporation Butthe fabric has severe weaknesses as I found out from testing a Wickers brandlong sleeve Tshirt made of pure polypropylene   Polypropyleneretains odor just trust me on this  Its got the same icky feeling againstyour skin as groovy s polyester shirts Sleeping in it was uncomfortableand in time I predict it might cause itch and abrasionthemed nightmares While it spreads your sweat across the fabric surface until it evaporates thesweat stays against your skin            Latelybetter synthetics have come along Powerdry a polyester fabric designed byMalden Mills and CoolMax a polyester concoction from DuPont boast two layerdimensional wicking an industry buzz phrase meaning sweat leaves your skininstantly then spreads out on the top layer of the fabric I tested a Duofoldshort sleeve Tshirt made of CoolMax  and an REI zip turtleneck made ofPowerdry  According to Malden Powerdrys patented BiPolar constructionhas two unique surfaces the soft inner layer rapidly wicks perspiration awayfrom the body while the durable outer layer spreads moisture for maximumevaporation I have no reason to doubt them DuPont claims CoolMax hasfourchannel fibers that give it the fastest drying rate of any fabric Theonly difference I could detect between them was in their feel against my skinCoolMax and Powerdry fared equally well in battling the sweat I worked uprunning laps around                   Slate               s offices but CoolMax gets the nodbecause not only does it not retain odor even when worn for two days andnights without deodorant but it truly feels like silk Im going to buyCoolMax for all my underwearits a terrific product            If
