                    Background        Many cloned animals have been created using M II oocytes        as the recipient cytoplasm sheep    cattle            mouse    goat   and pig            Maturationmeiosismitosispromoting factor MPF activity        of recipient M II oocytes appears to be important for the        reprogramming of nuclei of reconstructed embryos Two        distinct and different protocols emerge for embryo        reconstruction by nuclear transfer when using M II oocytes        as recipients The first is the transfer of nuclei in G S        or G phase into the preactivated recipients after reducing        MPF activity and the second is the transfer of nuclei in GO        or G phase directly into M II oocytes having high MPF        activity   Recently it has been shown that when mouse        embryonic stem cells   and bovine somatic cells          in the M phase were transferred into nontreated        recipients the chromosome constitution of reconstructed        embryos was normal in that the second polar body was        excluded after parthenogenetic activation and the embryos        developed to offspring The first protocol is effective for        production of blastomeres derived cloned embryos because        cell cycle synchronization of embryonic nuclei is difficult        and the majority of blastomeres are in the S phase at any        given time     In the preactivated oocyte the        nuclear membrane of the donor cells remains intact due to        the low activity of MPF and DNA synthesis occurs according        to the original cell cycle stage at the time of nuclear        transfer   and nuclear reprogramming occurs during the        expansion of the donor nucleus    Additionally        nuclei of cells of established embryonic cell lines are        reprogrammed in preactivated recipient oocytes porcine        embryos reconstituted with blastocystderived cells and        preactivated recipients have the ability to develop to        blastocysts   However there is only one report in        which cloned animals have been produced from embryos        reconstructed by transferring differentiated cells into        preactivated recipient oocytes   and the ability of        preactivated recipient oocytes to reprogram differentiated        cells is now in debate When bovine somatic cells were        transferred into preactivated recipient oocytes the        resulting reconstructed embryo development was limited        since all embryos arrested at the cell stage regardless        of the cell cycle of the donor cells   Because        embryonic genome activation of bovine embryos occurs        between the  to cell stages   preactivated        recipients may not reprogram somatic nuclei In contrast        when nuclei in G or G phase are transferred into        nontreated recipients reconstructed embryos can develop        to offspring in many species                   In the M II oocyte the membrane of the donor nucleus        is broken down and the chromosomes are prematurely        condensed due to the high activity of MPF After        parthenogenetic activation the membrane reforms and DNA        synthesis begins   MPF activity during oocyte        maturation is maximal at both M I and M II   Because        many studies suggest that exposure to high activity of MPF        is effective for reprogramming a donor nucleus from a        differentiated cell                     M I oocytes may reprogram somatic cell nuclei as well        In the amphibian the greatest yield and most advanced        tadpoles came from differentiated somatic cell nuclei        injected into M I oocytes    compared to M II        oocytes     although adults could not be        generated from these reconstructed embryos However there        are no reports that experimentally tested this hypothesis        in mammals In the present study we examined the ability        of porcine M I oocytes to reprogram somatic cell        nuclei                    Results                  Cell Cycle Analysis of Donor Cells          The cell cycle stages of ear fibroblasts after          reaching confluence or treatment with nocodazole were          analyzed using flow cytometry Analysis of the cell cycle          stages in confluent cells revealed that    of          the cells were at the GG phase    were at the          S phase and    were at the GM phase In the          population of cells collected after nocodazole treatment             were at the GG phase    were at          the S phase and    were at the GM phase          Experiments were repeated  times and the data are          expressed as mean  SEM                          Behaviour before Activation of Donor Cell          Nuclei          When confluent cells were transferred into M I          oocytes the fusion rate  was significantly P            higher than that  of embryos          reconstituted with nocodazoletreated cells and M I          oocytes Table  At  h after fusion spots of          condensed chromatin Figure Aand B were observed in          the majority  of embryos reconstructed by          transferring confluent cells and this percentage was          significantly P   higher than that  of          embryos reconstituted with nocodazoletreated cells When          nocodazoletreated cells were transferred into M I          oocytes one spot of condensed chromatin and one polar          body Figure C was observed in  of reconstructed          embryos Regardless of the cell cycle of the donor cells          the percentage  of embryos with swollen nuclei          Figure Dand E was low                          Behaviour after Activation of Donor Cell          Nuclei          As shown in Table  when confluent cells were used as          donors the fusion rate  was significantly P            higher than that  of          nocodazoletreated cells regardless of the maturation          stage of the recipient oocytes At  h after activation          swollen nuclei were observed in  and  of embryos          produced by transferring confluent cells into M I or M II          oocytes with no significant differences Although           of embryos reconstituted with          nocodazoletreated cells had swollen nuclei the          percentage of embryos with both the swollen nucleus and          polar body Figure F was only                           Development of Reconstructed Embryos          The cleavage rate  of embryos reconstituted          with confluent cells and M II oocytes was significantly          P   higher than that  of embryos          produced by transferring confluent or nocodazoletreated          cells into M I oocytes Table  However this          percentage  did not significantly differ from that          of embryos reconstituted with nocodazoletreated cells          and M II oocytes  When embryos reconstituted with          confluent cells and M I oocytes were cultured            blastocysts Figure  were obtained and this percentage          was significantly P   lower than that of          embryos produced by transferring confluent cells into M          II oocytes  There were no significant differences          in mean numbers of cells in the blastocysts between          different maturation stages of the recipient oocytes No          embryos developed to the blastocyst stage when          nocodazoletreated cells were used as donors regardless          of the maturation stage of the recipient oocytes                            Discussion        The results of the present study demonstrated the in        vitro developmental ability to blastocysts of porcine        embryos reconstituted with somatic cells and enucleated M I        oocytes To our knowledge this is the first report that        describes blastocyst formation of embryos reconstituted        with M I oocytes in mammals        When donor nuclei are transferred into nontreated M II        recipient oocytes that have high MPF activity various        changes referred to as nuclear remodeling occur in the        introduced nuclei This phenomenon is considered to involve        nuclear structural changes such as nuclear envelope        breakdown premature chromosome condensation and pronuclear        development and swelling     Nuclear remodeling        is thought to be a result of the exchange of proteins        between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments   and        is prerequisite to or is part of the reprogramming of gene        expression     Therefore it is generally        considered that the phenomenon of nuclear swelling is one        essential component of the more complex process of genetic        reprogramming   In the present study when confluent        or nocodazoletreated cells were transferred into        enucleated M I oocytes nuclear swelling was observed in         of reconstructed embryos after activation This        result suggests that porcine M I oocytes can initiate        reprogramming of both confluent and nocodazoletreated        cells Moreover some reconstructed embryos produced by        transferring confluent cells developed to the blastocyst        stage Because activation of the embryonic genome occurs by        the cell stage in the pig   it is evident that donor        nuclei were at least partially reprogrammed in these        blastocysts Therefore our results clearly indicate that        porcine M I oocytes like M II oocytes have the ability to        reprogram confluent somatic cell nuclei as determined by        nuclear remodeling and in vitro development        The blastocyst formation rate of reconstructed embryos        produced by transferring confluent cells into M I oocytes        was significantly lower than that of embryos reconstituted        with confluent cells and M II oocytes although there were        no significant differences in percentages of embryos with        swollen nuclei between different maturation stages of        recipient oocytes These results suggest that the        reprogramming of donor nuclei may be started but is not        completed in some embryos reconstituted with M I oocytes        It has been suggested that nuclear swelling may not        necessarily be a sufficient indicator of developmental        potential in a reconstructed embryo   In addition to        MPF mitogenactivated protein MAP kinase is also known        as an important protein kinase that regulates the meiotic        cell cycle   In mouse oocytes MAP kinase plays a more        important role in controlling chromatin and microtubule        behavior than MPF   However MAP kinase and MPF        activities do not vary between M I and M II of porcine        oocytes because phosphorylations of MAP kinase and histone        H kinase which corresponds to MPF activity reach the peak        level at M I and remain high beyond M II           Potentially an unknown factors is required for        reprogramming of nuclei which is present in M II oocytes        but may not be present or active in M I oocytes It is        known that pronuclear exchange between zygotes does not        prevent development of the reconstructed embryos   but        transfer of donor nuclei from later developmental stages        into enucleated zygotes brings about restricted development           One explanation of this phenomenon is that a        factors required for reprogramming of donor nuclei is        removed with the pronuclei from recipient zygotes        Similarly the factors would be present near the        chromosomes at M I and removed with the M I plate during        enucleation in many oocytes In contrast the factors is        believed to be in cytoplasts derived from M II oocytes        because embryos reconstituted with donor nuclei from later        developmental stages and enucleated M II oocytes can        develop to adults   An alternative cause is the effect        of cytochalasin B a microfilament polymerization        inhibitor In the present study reconstructed embryos        produced by transferring confluent cells into M I oocytes        were cultured in the maturation medium supplemented with        cytochalasin B to prevent loss of chromosomes by polar body        formation However it has been reported recently that        morphologically normal M I spindles are formed but further        meiotic progression does not occur in porcine oocytes        matured in a cytochalasin Bcontaining medium          Therefore it is possible that reprogramming of nuclei        transferred into M I oocytes is inhibited by cytochalasin        B Thirdly M I and M II oocytes may differ in cytoplasmic        competence When porcine M I oocytes are inseminated with        spermatozoa in vitro the formation rate of male and female        pronuclei is significantly lower than that in M II oocytes          Finally optimal conditions for activation may vary        between M I and M II oocytes To our knowledge there are        no reports that describe activation of MI oocytes in        mammals Parameters of the activation pulse used in the        present study were also optimized in a preliminary        experiment using M II oocytes It is possible that        optimization of methods for activation improves the        development of embryos reconstituted with M I oocytes        In contrast no reconstructed embryos developed to the        blastocyst stage regardless of the maturation stage of the        recipient oocytes when nocodazoletreated cells were        transferred although nuclear swelling was observed in         of the embryos When cells in M phase are used        as donors reconstructed embryos with a polar body are        diploid but embryos without a polar body are tetraploid          In the present study the percentage of embryos with        both a swollen nucleus and a polar body was low after        transfer of nocodazoletreated cells In the bovine the        potential of reconstructed embryos with or without the        polar body to develop to the blastocyst stage is not        different   However this study suggests that porcine        tetraploid embryos may not develop to blastocysts        In the present study there was a significant difference        in fusion rates between the cell cycles of donor cells The        plasma membrane of nocodazoletreated cells was weak        compared to that of confluent cells and many cells were        broken before and after applying a fusion pulse Parameters        of the fusion pulse were optimized in a preliminary        experiment using confluent cells Therefore it is expected        that optimal conditions for fusion vary among cell cycles        of donor cells in the pig        In general in vitro maturation IVM media used to        prepare recipient oocytes for production of cloned embryos        are usually supplemented with fetal calf serum FCS             or porcine follicular fluid pFF            It is a well known fact that growth factors and hormones        in addition to many other factors are abundant in serum           and follicular fluid     Therefore        supplementation of IVM media with FCS or pFF presents the        potential problems in proper quality control and        repeatability among laboratories or replicates Recently a        defined IVM system for porcine oocytes was developed in        order to eliminate such variability    In the        present study  of reconstructed embryos produced by        transferring confluent adult somatic cells into enucleated        M II oocytes matured in the proteinfree medium developed        to the blastocyst stage The blastocyst formation rate in        our study is similar to results from the recent reports in        which porcine adult somatic cumulus cells            or fetal fibroblasts                   were transferred into enucleated M II oocytes        matured in media supplemented with pFF In addition        quality of the blastocysts based on the mean number of        cells  cells equals if not exceeds results from        previous studies cumulus cells  cells   fetal        fibroblasts  cells                Although this study did not compare defined IVM        medium with complex medium the results indicate that        proteinfree IVM medium is suitable for maturing recipient        oocytes for the production of cloned embryos The defined        conditions will allow us to examine factors affecting        nuclear reprogramming of reconstructed embryos more        precisely and better understand the basic molecular        mechanisms of the process                    Conclusions        We have shown that porcine M I oocytes have a potential        to develop into blastocysts after nuclear transfer of        somatic cells However the process of nuclear        reprogramming may be different between M I and M II oocytes        because developmental abilities of reconstructed embryos        vary between the maturation stages of recipient oocytes        Comparison of reprogramming events between M I and M II        oocytes would bring about important information to        understand the mechanisms of nuclear reprogramming in        reconstructed embryos The use of defined IVM medium will        be useful for these studies Taken together the use of a        defined medium and optimal reprogramming conditions such as        the type of donor nuclei and recipient oocyte will lead to        improvements in porcine cloning outcomes                    Materials and Methods                  Donor Cells          Porcine fibroblasts were

   wires  m diameter attached to micromanipulators          were used as electrodes The single celloocyte complex          was sandwiched between the electrodes and oriented with          the contact surface between the cytoplast and the donor          cell perpendicular to the electrodes The distance          between the electrodes was about  m Membrane fusion          was induced by applying a

maturation medium with or without cytochalasin B            for  h and then activated M II oocytes were            enucleated at  h after IVM and embryos reconstituted            with them were activated at  h after fusion Activated            embryos were cultured in  l of G  medium for  h            and then examined for nuclear swelling and polar body            formation When confluent cells were used as donors            embryos were cultured in G medium supplemented with             gml cytochalasin B for  h after activation to            prevent extrusion of polar bodies                                  Development of Reconstructed Embryos            Experiment  was undertaken to compare in vitro            developmental abilities of reconstructed embryos            produced by transferring confluent or            nocodazoletreated cells into enucleated M I or M II            oocytes as described above After culture in G            medium for  days the embryos were transferred into             l of G medium   and continued to be            cultured The embryos were examined for cleavage and            blastocyst formation at  and  days after culture            respectively At the end of the culture period the            number of cells in blastocysts was examined The            blastocysts were placed on slides with a drop of            mounting medium consisting of glycerol and PBS             containing  mgml Hoechst  A cover slip was            placed on the top of the blastocysts and the edge was            sealed with fingernail polish The numbers of nuclei            were counted under ultraviolet light                                    Statistical Analysis          All percentage data were subjected to an arcsin square          root transformation in each replicate and the transformed          values were analyzed using oneway Experiment  or          twoway Experiments  and  ANOVA followed by          StudentNewmanKeuls test The numbers of cells in          blastocysts were analyzed using Student ttest A          probability of P   was considered statistically          significant
