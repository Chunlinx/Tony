                                 The Republic of Texas            The latest ultrarightrumbling comes from remote West Texas where a militiaallied group hasproclaimed itself the lawful government of the independent Republic of TexasROT members have declared war on both the federal government and the state ofTexas which they view as illegitimate occupiers of their nation An armedROT faction made headlines on April  by kidnapping two people and holdingthem on the grounds of the ROT embassy an attached trailer and shed outsidethe town of Ft Davis population  Police surrounded the compound andavoided violence by exchanging a jailed ROT member for the hostages            The ROTis the brainchild of Richard McLaren  a Missouriborn automobilemanualauthor and insurance salesman McLaren a vociferous opponent of all taxationdeclared in  his unique finding that the United States has never legallyannexed Texas He says that the state which won its independence from Mexicoin  joined the union illegally in  Under McLarens reading ofinternational law a treaty must be struck between sovereign nations prior toannexation No such TexasUS treaty was passed nor does it appear that anysuch treaty could have passed in  Treaties require a twothirdsvote of the US Senate and a bare majority of senators approved the statesadmission into the union            McLaren maintains that because Texas was illegally annexedTexans are not US citizens have no obligation to obey federal laws and areowed war reparations by the federal government In December  he and other radical antitax activists mainly from West Texas declared theirintention to reestablish the usurped authority of the ROT            Historians dismiss McLarensargument  His citation of the international law of annexation is vague If his internationallaw objection is valid why didnt antislavery senatorswho opposed admission of another slaveholding state raise it at the time  Amajority of Texans voted in favor of annexation in an  plebiscite  Andeven if the  annexation was illegal the argument is moot Texas and theother secessionist states rejoined the union after their defeat in the CivilWar            Accordingto the liberal watchdog Southern Poverty Law Center the number of armedmilitias has grown since the Oklahoma City bombing two years ago and nowexceeds  ROT members employ rhetoric similar to that of the militiascondemning taxation and lax protection of property rights            And they employ similar tactics Like theFreemen the Montana militia group that held federal authorities at bay for days the ROT has filed scores of liens on property owned by their foes atactic members call paper warfare A blizzard of liens has fallen on stateproperty which the ROT considers illegally confiscated Other bogus liens havebeen filed across the state on private property targeted at random By cloggingstate courts and tying up realestate sales the ROT says it hopes to garnerpolitical attention Like their soul mates in Montana ROT members have alsoissued  million worth of bad checks purchasing weapons computers andprovisions            As ROTambassador McLaren issues passports He also campaigns for United Nationsrecognition of his republic believing that the United States scuttled UNSecretaryGeneral Boutros BoutrosGhalis campaign for a second term last yearbecause he was sympathetic to the ROT            Internal dissension has reduced the groups numbers inrecent months From the start the sect purged members including its foundingpresident who failed to toe a militant line In March the ROT split into twofactionsthe smaller one led by McLaren advocated an alignment with militiasand plotted a violent strategy to remove the federal government from Texas theother eschewed violence and dissociated itself from McLaren On its Web site thenonviolent faction says McLaren has gone completely off the deep end            McLarensconfrontation with law enforcement has been months in the making After a judgeordered him to cease filing bogus liens he continued and was found in contemptof court Wanted on charges of burglary McLaren holed up in Ft Davis wherearmed guards kept roundtheclock watch Because McLarens neighbors spottedarmed men arriving in trucks with Idaho license plates it is believed thatsome of the  men and women currently residing in the embassy may belong toother rightist groups            The standoff was sparked April  when policearrested two ROT membersone because he refused to display license plates onhis vehicle McLarens followers retaliated by taking as hostages two neighborswho had long clamored for the leaders arrest After the hostage exchangetalks continued but have been unsuccessful while McLarens rhetoric has grownincreasingly apocalyptic            Fear of repeating the deadlyclash between federal agents and Branch Davidian cult members has deterredpolice from raiding the compound Also police take seriously McLarens claimthat he coordinated with militias throughout Texas who will react violently inresponse to a police assault On Wednesday April  police in Pecos  milesfrom Ft Davis arrested seven men who were carrying explosives and guns andadmitted they were headed to join McLaren            Secessionists in Hawaii andAlaska argue that the federal government failed to consult natives beforeannexing these territories The Alaska movement like the Texas one stems froma libertarian aversion to the federal government The Hawaiians hope to restorethe monarchy ousted by US forces in  Hawaiians voted in favor ofsecession in a nonbinding referendum last year but few expect the movement tosucceed
