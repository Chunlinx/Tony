                    Background        Organic phosphate compounds are the central metabolites        of all biological systems      Some are the basic        building blocks of nucleic acids some like ATP and GTP        are additionally cellular energy stores others like cAMP        or cGMP are messengers in signal transduction and yet        others such as FAD NAD thiamine phosphates and pyridoxal        phosphate are cofactors for a range of enzymes             Protein domains belonging to a relatively small set of        structural folds are known to bind or catalyze reactions        that utilize these organic phosphate compounds see SCOP        database httpscopmrclmbcamacukscop             Several of these folds trace back to some of the earliest        phases of the evolution of the protein world and        participate in a wide range of disparate biological        functions in extant proteins      Some folds such as        the Ploop fold the Rossmann fold and the Hsplike fold        have been well studied and comprise mainly of dedicated        nucleotide binding or hydrolyzing proteins               Others such as the palmdomain which is found in adenylyl        cyclases and various nucleic acid polymerases belong to        more generalized protein folds that contain representatives        with diverse biochemical activities       Current        availability of extensive genome sequence data allows one        to identify less numerous nevertheless biological        important organic phosphatebinding domains that may have        previous eluded detection The identification of such        domain superfamilies containing enzymes with several        different activities often throws considerable light on        their evolution structure and catalytic mechanisms                    The majority of previously known nucleotide cyclases        belong to two major folds The classical adenylyl cyclases        guanylyl cyclases and the GGDEF diguanylate cyclase        domains share the catalytic palm domain with the family B        DNA polymerases reverse transcriptases viral RNA        dependent RNA polymerases and eukaryotetype primases              The pathogenic adenylyl cyclases of several        bacteria and the CyaAlike proteobacteria adenylyl cyclases        are extremely divergent versions of the catalytic domain        seen in the Pol family of nucleotidyl transferases           also see SCOP database        httpscopmrclmbcamacukscop While the catalytic        domains of these two superfamilies have very different        folds they follow a similar reaction mechanism that is        dependent on two Mg ions coordinated by a cluster of        acidic residues However the CyaB adenylyl cyclase which        was identified in the bacterium         Aeromonas hydrophila is unrelated to        any of these above superfamilies of enzymes     Though        close relatives of this enzyme exist in some bacteria like                Yersinia pestis and         Borrelia burgdorferi and the archaea        its antecedents or catalytic mechanism have not been        understood Using sensitive sequence profile comparison        methods we show that the CyaBlike adenylyl cyclases are        homologs of the soluble mammalian thiamine triphosphatases            and they define a novel superfamily of enzymes        that utilize ATP and other organic phosphates We present        evidence that a representative of this domain was present        in the last common ancestor of all extant life forms The        primary biological function of these proteins appears to be        related to polyphosphate and nucleotide metabolism Cyclic        AMP generation and thiamine triphosphate hydrolysis appear        to be secondarily acquired activities We also identify the        potential active site and substrate interactingresidues        and postulate that these enzymes are likely to catalyze a        twometal ion dependent reaction on structural scaffold        that is completely different from that seen in the other        two superfamilies of adenylyl cyclases                    Results and discussion                  Identification of the CYTH domain          In order to understand the evolutionary affinities and          provenance of the CyaB adenylyl cyclase from           Aeromonas hydrophila  we carried          out database searches using sensitive sequence profile          analysis methods As CyaB is a small protein with no          detectable low complexity regions we used it as a seed          to initiate a PSIBLAST search    run to          convergence with expectvalue for inclusion in profile            The search resulted in the detection of its obvious          orthologs from           Yersinia and various archaea at          significant expect e values ranging from from             to     The second iteration recovered proteins          from more archaea eukaryotes evalue               Clostridium     and           Borrelia     Further          iterations run to convergence recovered the soluble          mammalian thiamine triphosphatases     and the          Nterminal region of           E coli YgiF At convergence          several bacterial proteins that showed a conserved EXEXK          where X is any amino acid characteristic of this          family and a region Cterminal to a Ploop like uridine          kinase domain in plants were also recovered at borderline          evalues e value    Reciprocal searches          initiated with the           E coli YgiF protein residues           not only recovered its bacterial orthologs          archaeal CyaB homologs and eukaryotic proteins but also          several others such as           Bacillus subtilis YjbK           Methanosarcina Ma and           Mesorhizobium loti Mll with          evalues in the range of   upon first detection          Additionally transitive searches initiated from the          region Cterminal to the uridine kinase of the plants          D from           Oryza sativa  region           recovered archaeal CyaB homologs confirming their          relationship to with the other proteins detected in these          searches Regular expression searches with the          conservation pattern found in these CyaB homologs also          recovered the most of the members detected in the          abovementioned profile searches but failed to recover          any new candidates          In all these searches the alignments more or less          spanned the entire length of the CyaB protein and          typically contained the same set of conserved residues          The Gibbs sampling procedure revealed the presence of          seven conserved motifs with a probability of chance          occurrence less than   in the search space          comprising of the  or so proteins that were identified          in the above searches as having this domain We clustered          these proteins using the BLASTCLUST program in several          smaller clusters and prepared multiple alignments for the          individual clusters and predicted secondary structure for          these set using the PHD program A nearly complete          congruence was seen in the comparison of the secondary          structures of the individual clusters In many cases the          region of similarity to CyaB comprised the entire length          of the target protein detected in these searches          However in some cases it only comprised a part of the          protein with rest of the protein being made of other          globular domains These observations taken together          suggested that CyaB and soluble mammalian thiamine          triphosphatases define a novel superfamily of conserved          domains which may either occur by itself or in          combination with other domains We named this domain the          CYTH            Cy aB           th iamine triphosphatase domain          after the two experimentally characterized proteins in          which it is present                          Sequence conservation structure and biochemical          activities of the CYTH domain          All complete CYTH domain sequences were aligned using          the TCoffee program and this alignment was further          refined based on the PSIBLAST HSPs conserved motifs          detected in the Gibbs sampling procedure and predicted          secondary structure for the individual groups Fig  A          text copy of the alignment is being provided as an          additional file see additional fileand additional file           The predicted secondary structure for this domain          indicated an  fold with  conserved strands and           conserved helices Neither the predicted secondary          structure nor the pattern of the conserved residues          revealed an obvious relationship with any previously          recognized fold Given that the CYTH domain is the only          globular domain in the enzymes thiamine triphosphatase          and CyaB it is predicted to be an enzymatic domain          While the reactions catalyzed by these two enzymes are          distinct their substrates respectively thiamine          triphosphate and ATP are both organic triphosphates The          CYTH domain is also present Cterminal to the catalytic          Ploop containing domain in the plant and slime mold          uridine kinase homologs In these proteins it is likely          to interact with nucleoside diphosphates or          triphosphates which are substrates for these kinases          These observations suggest that the CYTH domains are          likely to be domains specialized to bind nucleotides and          other organic phosphates A multiple alignment of this          superfamily reveals the presence of several nearly          universally conserved charged residues that are likely to          form the active site of these enzymes Fig  The most          prominent of these are an EXEXK motif associated with          strand of the domain two basic residues in helix a          K at the end of strand  an E in strand  a basic          residue in helix a D at the end of strand  and two          acidic residues typically glutamates in strand  Fig           The presence of around  conserved acidic positions          in the majority of the CYTH domains suggests that it          coordinates two divalent metal ions Analogous active          sites that coordinate two metal ions are observed in          domains with similar activities such as the classical          adenylylguanylyl cyclases family B DNA polymerases          pol fold nucleotidyl transferases and triphosphatases          or phosphoesterases of the HD and DHH superfamilies                 Consistent with these observations both          CyaB and ThTPase have been shown to require Mg ions for          their nucleotide cyclase and phosphatase activities                        Additional file           A text copy of the alignments of the CYTH domain and          the CHAD are provided in simple alignment and Clustal aln          formats          Click here for file          Additional file           Alignments presented in the article in PDF format          Click here for file          The four conserved basic residues in the CYTH domain          are most probably involved in the binding of acidic          phosphate moieties of their substrates Fig  The          conservation of these two sets of residues in the          majority of CYTH domains suggests that most members of          this group are likely to possess an activity dependent on          two metal ions with a preference for nucleotides or          related phosphatemoietybearing substrates The proposed          biochemical activity and the arrangement of predicted          strands in the primary structure of the CYTH domain imply          that the may adopt a barrel or sandwichlike          configuration with metal ions and the substrate bound in          the central cavity The only prominent exceptions to the          basic conservation pattern of the CYTH domains are the          versions found in the plant and           Dictyostelium pyrimidine kinase          homologs Fig  Atglike These versions lack           of the  conserved acidic residues but retain  of the           conserved basic residues Fig  This leads to the          prediction that these CYTH domains are catalytically          inactive However as they retain the basic residues          they probably still bind the organic phosphate          substrates and function as regulatory domains that are          linked to Ploop kinase domains                          Phyletic patterns evolutionary history and          potential biological functions of the CYTH domains          CYTH domains are present in most of the major          lineages for which sequence information is currently          available from the three principal superkingdomains of          life Fig  We used the multiple alignment of the CYTH          domain to construct phylogenetic trees using the least          squares neighbor joining and maximum likelihood methods          see Materials and Methods The monophyletic clusters          that emerged in this analysis were essentially the same          as those that were derived through similarity based          clustering using BLASTCLUST The majority of archaeal and          eukaryotic proteins formed a monophyletic cluster to the          exclusion of most of the bacterial proteins RELL          Bootstrap support  Fig  This cluster was also          supported by a unique synapomorphy a shared derived          character in the form of a conserved motif Dh where h          is a hydrophobic residue associated with the second          strand Fig  This phylogenetic tree topology          resembles that of several proteins involved in core          cellular functions such as the DNA recombinase RecA          aminoacyl tRNA synthetases RNA polymerase and other RNA          metabolism proteins       This suggests that a          CYTH domain was present in the last universal common          ancestor of all extant life forms and the extant forms          are in part vertically inherited from this ancestral          form          However there are certain anomalies to this pattern          The CYTH domains are entirely absent from the small          genomes of pathogenic bacteria such as           Rickettsia and           Chlamydia as well as some of the          large genomes such as           Deinococcus radiodurans  At least          a single copy of the CYTH domain is seen in most archaeal          and eukaryotic genomes sampled to date with the          exception of           Thermoplasma and the yeasts where          it is absent This implies that the CYTH domain has been          lost independently on a number of occasions in evolution          CyaB homologs from           Aeromonas            Clostridium Borrelia  and           Ralstonia lie firmly RELL          Bootstrap   within the archaeal and eukaryotic          clusters rather than with their bacterial counterparts          Fig  These bacterial forms also share the unique          sequence signature in the second strand with this group          suggesting that they have been derived through horizontal          transfer from different archaeal and eukaryotic sources          Fig  In particular the CyaB homolog from           Ralstonia groups very strongly with          the animal versions and appears to be a recent horizontal          transfer in this bacterium from the latter clade The          possibility of lateral transfer of           Aeromonas CyaB from an archaeal          source has been previously suggested and is consistent          with the enzyme being optimally functional under high          temperature     There are  distinct CYTH domains in          the euryarchaeon           Methanosarcina acetivorans  in          addition to the version which groups with the CYTH          domains that are found in single or duplicate copies in          other archaea and eukaryotes These former versions          strongly group with CYTH domains from actinobacteria          Rell Boostrap  to the exclusion of other lineage          Fig  Furthermore they share a fusion to a novel          conserved domain with characteristic histidines see          below with the actinobacterial versions Thus they          appear to have been transferred laterally from the          actinobacteria into the           Methanosarcina lineage followed by          a small lineage specific expansion in the latter          Bacteriophages like RB that contain a solo CYTH          domain which is closer to the version seen in its          proteobacterial hosts could have served as conduits for          the lateral distribution of this domain          The phyletic pattern of the CYTH domain is not very          typical of signaling enzymes like nucleotide cyclases          Classic adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases show a far more          sporadic distribution and are often present in multiple          copies fused to a variety of signaling domains such as          the cyclic nucleotide binding domains     Cyclic          nucleotide generating activity is not known to exist in a          subset of the archaea     though most of them          contain a wellconserved copy of the CYTH domain          Experimental analysis on the           Methanococcus CyaB homolog revealed          no adenylyl cyclase activity comparable to that seen in           Aeromonas CyaB     Likewise          there is no evidence for a widespread presence of the          ThTPase activity in the organisms that contain CYTH          domain proteins     Hence the principal biological          function of the CYTH domains may be different from those          of the experimentally characterized members of this          family General conservation of this domain across a          range of organisms and its presence in the LUCA suggests          the possibility of an important general role in cellular          process of freeliving organisms In order to decipher          the potential biological roles of this domain we used          different forms of contextual information regarding these          domains in the form of domain architectures gene          neighborhoods predicted operons and experimental          evidence for interactions between proteins Both domain          architecture and operon analysis have been used          extensively to make functional predictions of poorly          characterized domains or genes                 Moreover the presence of evolutionarily conserved          operons often correlates with the involvement of the          component genes in a sequential pathway or physically          interacting complex      We summarize the          different forms of contextual information that we          extracted from the CYTH domains in the form a network          diagram Fig           The CYTH domain shows a small array set of fusions to          other conserved domains Fig  One of the most          prevalent fusions is to an uncharacterized domain with a          characteristic pattern of conserved histidines and other          charged residues This domain is predicted to adopt an          helical fold and is according referred to as CHAD          CHAD           c onserved           h istidine            helical           d omain Fig  The sequence          conservation pattern Fig  suggests that this domain          is likely to contain two repeat units with at least           helices each at its core While no clear functional          prediction can be made for the CHAD the conserved          charged residues could form a strongly polar surface that          could participate either in metal chelation or act as          phosphoacceptors Another notable fusion is with a          specific version of the HD hydrolase domain              which is also found fused to the Cterminus of the          HSPfold domain in the exopolyphosphatase PPX Fig           HD domains typically possess phosphoesterase          activity and are fused to catalytic domains that possess          nucleotide kinase nucleotidyltransferase nucleotide          cyclase or diguanylate cyclase activity      This          fits well with the observed cyclase activity seen in          CyaB but is also consistent with phosphotransferase or          nucleotidyl transferase for the CYTH domain Finally          catalytically inactive versions of the CYTH domain are          found fused to the nucleotide kinase domain in uridine          kinase homologs and may serve as an allosteric          nucleotidebinding site in these enzymes Fig           In terms of conserved gene neighborhoods          CYTHdomainencoding genes like mll from          proteobacteria are frequently found in the          neighborhood of genes encoding solo CHADs Fig           Additionally in           Methanosarcina the CYTHencoding          genes are found in predicted operons or in the          neighborhood of genes encoding exopolyphosphatase PPX          and polyphosphate kinase PPK Furthermore in           Sulfolobus  a gene for a CHAD          protein is in a predicted operon along with genes for          thymidylate kinase and PPX CHAD and CTYHencoding genes          are also found in the neighborhood of PPK and PPX in           Chlorobium tepidum and           Geobacter metallireducens           respectively Fig  Genes for CYTH domains also          cooccur in predicted operons with genes for another          polyphosphate utilizing enzyme the          polyphosphatedependent NAD kinase PPNK in certain          cyanobacteria eg           Prochlorococcus marinus  and Gram          positive bacteria like           Oceanobacillus iheyensis  Other          potential connections are furnished by the cooccurrence          of genes for CYTHdomain proteins with genes involved in          with nucleoside polyphosphate metabolism These include          cooccurrence with the gene for adenosine          tetraphosphatase APAH eg in           Magnetococcus sp  and with genes          encoding the YjbMdomain in Grampositive bacteria The          YjbM domain most often occurs fused to pentaphosphate          guanosinepyrophosphohydrolase SpoT and GTP          pyrophosphokinase RelA suggesting a role for it in the          metabolism of the stringentresponse nucleoside          polyphosphate          These contextual connections are consistent with the          participation of CYTH domains in organophosphate          biochemistry and circumstantially associate it with the          metabolic network related to polyphosphates and          nucleoside polyphospates Fig      Specifically          PPK and PPX have been shown to respectively lengthen or          shorten polyphosphate polymers     These two enzymes          also appear to interact with the nucleotide metabolism of          the cell In particular PPK and PPNK can utilize PolyP          to synthesize nucleoside polyphosphates while PPK along          with adenylate kinase can carry out          polyphosphatedependent phosphorylation AMP                Hence it is likely that the CYTH domain proteins          participate directly in this biochemical network along          with these proteins One possibility is that the CYTH          domains utilize polyphosphates to synthesize different          organophosphate derivatives including nucleotides          Alternatively they could also function as          phosphoesterases that hydrolyze particular nucleoside          polyphosphates These leads could aid further          experimental investigations on the CYTH domain that might          help in uncovering ancient asyetunexplored links          between polyphosphate and nucleotide metabolism          Finally at least in some lineages the CYTH domain          proteins may have been secondarily recruited for other          functions The CyaB protein may represent one such case          where after the original transfer from an archaeon into          the proteobacterial lineage it may have acquire the novel          function as an adenylyl cyclase However it is entirely          possible that even in this case the adenylyl cyclase          activity is secondary to some other uncharacterized          metabolic activity The vertebrate soluble thiamine          triphosphatase has undergone accelerated divergence as          it is present on a long branch in the phylogenetic tree          Fig  ThTPase is also unusual in lacking the           rdconserved acidic domain of the CYTH domain Hence it          may represent a case of relatively recent acquisition of          a new catalytic activity                            Conclusions        We show that         Aeromonas adenylyl cyclase CyaB and        thiamine triphosphatase define a novel superfamily of        catalytic domains that act on nucleotides and        organophosphate substrates These domains are widely        distributed in all the  superkingdoms of life and can be        traced back to the last ancestor of all life forms We        identify  conserved acidic residues that are likely to        form the active site of these enzymes and  conserved        basic residues that may participate in interactions with        phosphatemoietycontaining substrates We postulate that        these enzymes are likely to chelate  divalent cations and        are likely follow a bimetal reaction mechanism similar to        what has been proposed for nucleotide cyclases nucleic        acid polymerases or certain phosphoesterases such as those        of the HD and DHH superfamilies A version of the CYTH        domain which is fused to the catalytic domain of        nucleotide kinases lacks the predicted catalytic residues        and probably function as an allosteric regulatory domain        Additionally we detected a novel domain termed CHAD        which occurs fused to the CYTH domain or is encoded by        genes occurring in the same operon as those encoding CYTH        domains CHAD contains conserved histidines that are        predicted to either chelate metals or serve as        phosphoacceptors Based on phyletic distribution and        contextual information we conclude that these enzymes may        play a critical role in the interface between nucleotide        and polyphosphate metabolism                    Methods        The nonredundant NR database of protein sequences        National Center for Biotechnology Information NIH        Bethesda was searched using the BLASTP and PSIBLAST        programs     Profile searches using the PSIBLAST        program were conducted either with a single sequence or an        alignment used as the query with a profile inclusion        expectation E value threshold of  and were iterated        until convergence Additionally hidden Markov model based        searches using a multiple alignment of known members were        run using the HMMER package     The Gibbs sampling        procedure as implemented in the MACAW program was used to        detect and evaluate statistically significant conserved        motifs     Multiple alignments were constructed using        the TCoffee program     followed by manual correction        based on the PSIBLAST results Protein secondary structure        was predicted using a multiple alignment as the input for        the JPRED and PHD programs      Preliminary        clustering of proteins was done using the BLASTCLUST        program with empirically determined length and score        threshold cut off values For documentation see        ftpftpncbinihgovblastdocumentsREADMEbcl        Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbor        joining or least square method followed by local        rearrangements using the maximum likelihood algorithm to        predict the most likely tree The robustness of tree        topology was assessed with  Resampling of Estimated        Log Likelihoods RELL bootstrap replicates The MOLPHY and        Phylip software packages were used for phylogenetic        analyses             The species abbreviations used in the
