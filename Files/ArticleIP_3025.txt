                                 NiceyNicey            If you grew up in the sas I did its nearly impossible to watch the rise of the Internet withoutthinking back to the rise of television way back when A powerful newtechnology occasioned an enormous amount of hyperventilation about the newmediums potential as an agent of changechange it almost goes withoutsaying that would demonstrably improve the society Television would be thegreatest educational force ever created It would not just entertain but alsoenlighten Highmindedness would reign Et cetera et cetera            Some fivedecades have passed and we know all about television now We know forinstance that while televisions effect on society has been large it hasntbeen especially highminded Television has come to be much more about sweepsweek than about uplifting the culture It seems fair to say that in part as aresult of our experience with television we tend to shy away from makinggrandiose claims for new technologies anymore Weve become warier Its been along time since weve fallen for the grand promise of a new technologicalmarvel            Which is why the hoopla surrounding the Internet is sobewildering Where is all that hardwon cynicism that now marks the Americancharacter It vanishes as soon as the subject turns to the Internet and itsalleged power to transform our lives Suddenly we are innocents again just asin the s willing to believe just about any claim about the Internetspromise Not only can the Internet help free citizens from the tyranny ofoppressive governments not only can it make investors wealthier and citizensmore active and students more eager to learn but it can also enhance theexperience of watching a ballgame by allowing you to interact with acommentator while the game is still going on Im still trying to figure outwhy anybody would want to do that            Moresurprising yet Internet proselytizing is often led by actual smartpeoplepeople like Esther Dyson Dyson is without question one of thecomputer industrys Really Big Thinkers Shes on a firstname basis with allthe computer moguls In her acknowledgments she coyly thanks all the Bills Ihave known Her industry confabs drip with cachet And her newsletterRelease   may well be the single most indispensable publication inall of technologydom full of insightful analysis and trendspotting in thebest sense of the word Her profile is high enough that the publisher feltjustified in putting her face on the cover of her new book which is titledRelease   Dyson says that the paperback edition when it comes outwill be called Release   Cute            Unfortunately the sharpness that characterizesher newsletter is nowhere to be found in her book I live on the Net writesDysonand it shows For one thing her prose more closely resembles a seriesof email missives than a rigorous argument All that emailing she doesappears to have caused her to forget how to write more than four consecutiveparagraphs at a time More crucially her design for living in the digitalage as the subtitle puts it comes across as a cross between New Agephilosophy and s hyperbole Critical thinking has been replaced by wishfulthinking            WhatDyson essentially believes is that if we would just embrace the Net we couldmake the world a better place Really For instance the Net will help createwonderful communities of likeminded people whose interactions are spirited butalways fairmindedjust like Dysons interactions with the Net communitiesshes involved in This will happen because people will gravitate towardcommunities where they share interests and respect the views of others in thecommunity Dyson never quite gets around to explaining what happens to thosewho tend to disrupt those nurturing Net communities She believes the Net willallow those who want freedom to be able to work on their own terms withoutsacrificing as much as they must today In other words the Net will freepeople from the need to work for large organizations in order to make a decentliving In Dysons view this will be particularly good for obnoxious peoplePeople who arent much fun to work with will be able to become moreindependent is how she phrases it            And on and on The Net will foster truthtelling and fullerdisclosure in all sorts of areas It will allow people to be anonymous when itsuits them and to be themselves when that suits them If peoples secrets aresomehow revealed on the Net well that could be good too At the same timewe may all become more tolerant if everyones flaws are more visible And mypersonal favorite Dyson believes that the explosion of Internet content willsomehow bring back new respect for people for personal attention forservice and for human interaction            Underlyingall her prognostications on work security privacy and so on is one centraland rather circular idea If the Internet is going to live up to itspotential says Dyson we need to be nicer to each other As she puts it Onepurpose of this book is to encourage people to make the mainstream ofcyberspace nice enough that people will want to live their social lives thereBut she also seems to believe that if we would start spending more of oursocial lives on the Net that would help make us nicer since the culture ofthe Internet will inevitably foster niceness            Niceness in fact permeates thisbookeverything Dyson says she tries to say as nicely as possible This istrue even when shes conceding that not everyone in cyberspace is as nice asshe is It may not be nice to say it she writes at one point but peopleare not all always nice and therefore a little social pressure can be a goodthing See how nice that was            There aretwo problems with this emphasis on niceness one small and one large The smallproblem is that as virtues go niceness is wildly overrated Nice books forinstance are usually bland booksas this one is More to the point forpeople who are trying to get something done too much niceness is likely to getin the way Very few of Dysons Silicon Valley CEO friends are nice exceptmaybe to her            The larger problem is that the Internet is simply not goingto make us nicer peoplenor are we going to become nicer just because we wantto see the Internet reach its full potential The notion is ludicrous on theface of it No matter how much information gets loaded into it the Internet isnever going to transform the dynamics of human behavior At least not for thebetter In fact the evidence thus far is quite depressing in this regard Asanyone who has spent any time in a chat room knows the bad tends to drive outthe good Which when you think about it is pretty much the way it happens inthe offline world            My own bet is that by ayear in which Dyson places many of her predictionsbooks like hers will seemlike artifacts from a more gullible age We wont be making extravagant claimsfor the Internet anymore but will accept that its just a toolsometimesextremely useful sometimes not Some of what is on it will be very good a lotof it will be junk Itll be just like television And no one will benicer
