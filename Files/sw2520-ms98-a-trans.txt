           well whats your favorite dish   oh for your question probably its uh tough to decide between like some sort of a Chinese dish or something like pizza   yeah yeah i understand that i like oriental cooking and uh pasta and i have the same problem uh   umhum   Italian heritage so i definitely like pasta but i like Italian and the two dont mix though  ive tried that that doesnt      no no although you can make a sort of a Chinese pizza   yeah that doesnt work very well either       uh i dont know sort of dumb what kind of food would you have in a dinner party well it depends on what kind of people you got coming over so well leave it at that   sure   uh let me see what do you what you like to cook uh just everything or do you have specialties   im i pretty much specialize i guess in uh Italian and Chinese um im a vegetarian   yeah   as uh Chinese gives me a lot of room to play with ive been ive been doing some stuff with um Middle Eastern lately you know cooking up dals and stuff which has been fun   yeah umhum umhum yeah i um        i ive been collecting recipes and modifying recipes for a long long time   umhum   and uh i run a little direct mail business on the side and i finally put together a cookbook      wow   and uh ive got to i got to reformat it i i did it on my word processor and now ive got to redo the whole thing again and im trying to figure out a cheap way to a quick way to do it without having to retype it   umhum   because uh its its all size about its not its not very big i mean its like a hundred and five pages something like that   umhum   but its got lots of good recipes so i was thinking about trying to sell that on the side just  for fun   umhum yeah yeah i usually um you know i get Usenet so i usually just uh look at the recipe groups in there uh for interesting things   umhum well see what else can we talk about food   well what sort of cookbooks do you um do you usually use   well usually hardly any at all anymore um ive ive gotten together sort of like basic recipes   yeah umhum   and once you have those you can add to them or take away from them and come up with all kinds of different dishes   thats true      i i have several cookbooks uh Betty Crocker and New York Times and a couple of Japanese cookbooks a couple of Chinese cookbooks i even got a Filipino cookbook um   umhum hm   they have a nice dish in there for a chicken dish i forgot the name of it but it takes a special kind of sausage and you can only get it at Filipino stores   well thats interesting   yeah and its its a its a strange sort of its sort of like a pepperoni      umhum   but its it has a much sharper flavor and its uh        its almost like it has red dye in it or something when you cook it it bleeds and it colors the food   hm   its pretty interesting but its a real good chicken dish its sort of like a chicken potpie in a way you have a crust on top and all that   umhum    umhum   delicious though i love it   do you yeah i pretty much i i guess i stick pretty much i got a couple of Moosewood books some   yeah   The Greens i find to be very handy   yeah   um    other than that i mean i you know i got five or six others that i can i can look up for inspiration or something i dont know but uh yeah but   yeah an idea yeah thats the way i am i generally get there and      right   i have a have an idea of what i wanna do i dont really know how to get started so i i look at something get me get me ah yeah well ill add this to it and do this and turns out pretty good sometimes      right umhum yeah i find its usually pretty useful to cook you know some number of recipes out of a book to get a flavor of the style     yeah   and then from that point you can pretty much improvise once you once you understand the spicing patterns and stuff like that   yeah well i mean i mean thats yeah thats the fun of cooking improvising   right absolutely   if youre gonna sit there and just follow a recipe thats no fun   umhum   you know   i agree   you know a monkey can do that   umhum   i bet even my cats could do that       no not this one shes dead to the world right now oh well well lets see i guess thats about it on food   yeah okay   all right good talking to you Brad take care bye   nice talking to you bye
