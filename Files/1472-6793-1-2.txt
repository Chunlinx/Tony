                    Background        Maitotoxin MTX one of the most potent marine toxins        known is found in the redtide dinoflagellate         Gambierdiscus toxicus and is        responsible in part for Ciguatera seafood poisoning In all        cells examined to date MTX at subnanomolar concentrations        causes a profound increase in cytosolic free Ca        concentration Ca          i    This occurs not by release of        Ca from internal stores but rather from activation of a        ubiquitouslyexpressed nonselective Ca permeable        cation channel CaNSC present in the plasmalemma                Channel activation is followed after a        short lag by the activation or formation of large        endogenous pores that allow organic molecules with        molecular weights of  Da to cross the plasma        membrane   The activation of these pores can be        determined experimentally by following the uptake of        ethidium and propidiumbased vital dyes These dyes of        varying molecular weights are normally excluded from the        cytoplasm of intact viable cells but gain access to the        cell interior following pore formation where they bind to        nucleic acids with a concomitant increase in dye        fluorescence The large pores activated by MTX have been        referred to as cytolyticoncotic pores or COP since their        activation ultimately leads to the release of lactate        dehydrogenase LDH an indication of necrotic or oncotic        cell death          The cell death cascade activated by MTX is not unique to        this toxin Stimulation of PX purinergic receptors by ATP        causes similar changes in cytosolic Ca and vital dye        uptake          suggesting that        MTX activates a cell death cascade that is physiologically        relevant although the exact role of either the PX or        MTXinduced cascade in normal cellular biology remains        unknown For the PX receptor it has been suggested that        the Ca permeable channels grow in size to form the        dyepermeable pores through either aggregation of channel        subunits or through dilation of the existing channel pore        structure       In support of this model        it has been found that the kinetics of ATPinduced pore        formation in HEK cells heterologously expressing the PX          receptor appears to depend on        molecular size of the permeating ionic species          However we recently showed that although MTX and ATP        activate distinct channels the characteristics of the ATP        and MTXactivated COP are indistinguishable   These        results suggest that the channel and COP are unique        molecular structures The aggregation or dilation model        make specific predictions concerning the kinetics of dye        uptake In particular this model predicts a delay between        channel activation and dye uptake and this delay should be        directly proportional to the molecular size of the        permeating dye Furthermore if pores grow in size dye        uptake should be nonlinear with time In contrast if        channel activation causes the formation or activation of a        molecularly unique COP with fixed pore dimensions the        delay between channel activation and dye uptake should be        independent of molecular size but the subsequent rate of        dye uptake should be linear and inversely proportional to        molecular weight To distinguish between these two models        the effect of MTX on Ca          i  vital dye uptake and LDH release was        examined in bovine aortic endothelial cells a cell line        particularly sensitive to the cytolytic effects of MTX The        results of the present study are consistent with the        activation of an endogenous COP of fixed pore        dimensions        The opening of large pores in the plasmalemma is        expected to cause a dramatic change in the ionic        concentration gradients that normally exist between the        extracellular and intracellular milieus ie loss of K         and gain of Na  Ca  and Cl by the cell The        concomitant flow of water into the cell as a result of this        ionic redistribution will drive the cell towards the        GibbsDonnan equilibrium The change in osmotic pressure        will produce cell swelling and ultimately membrane rupture        and release of large macromolecules from the cytoplasm        This final phase in the cell death cascade can be monitored        experimentally by measuring the release of the ubiquitous        cytosolic enzyme LDH The role of COP and the biophysical        mechanism associated with this rather violent cellular        event remains unknown However many cell types undergo        membrane blebbing in response to changes in osmotic        pressure Such membrane blebbing which may in a sense        represent a cellular safety valve has been reported during        both ATP and MTXinduced cell death    but it is        unclear if blebbing occurs before during or after COP        formation or LDH release In the present study the effect        of MTX on vital dye uptake in BAECs was correlated with        changes in cell morphology using single cell fluorescence        videomicroscopy The videos presented demonstrate that COP        activation as indicated by vital dye uptake correlates in        time with the formation of membrane blebs and that        membrane lysis ie LDH release is associated with        dramatic bleb dilation                    Results and Discussion                  MTX increases Ca  iin BAECs          Furaloaded BAECs were suspended in HBS placed in a          cuvette at C and the response to extracellular          application of MTX was recorded as a function of time          Fig  MTX produced an immediate          concentrationdependent increase in Ca            i  At the highest concentration of          MTX examined  nM Ca            i rapidly increased within  minutes          from a mean  SE resting level of    nM to an          apparent Ca            i value close to fura saturation We          previously showed that MTXinduced activation of COP          allows leakage of fura from human skin fibroblasts            Thus the apparent saturation of the fluorescence          ratio observed in BAECs reflects at least in part a          contribution from extracellular fura This is          particularly true at later times Nonetheless the major          effect of increasing MTX concentration was on the rate of          change of Ca            i  and the apparent ED            was approximately  nM MTX MTX          had no effect on BAEC Ca            i in the absence of extracellular Ca          data not shown demonstrating that MTX activates Ca          influx but does not cause the mobilization of Ca          from internal stores These results are similar to          those obtained in human skin fibroblasts mouse THP          monocytes and human embryonic kidney HEK cells             and supports the conclusion that the MTXactivated CaNSC          is ubiquitously expressed                          MTX activates COP in BAECs          To evaluate MTXinduced activation of COP in BAECs          the uptake of ethidium M           w  Da YOPRO M           w  Da and POPO M           w  Da was examined at various          concentrations of MTX Fig  After a short lag MTX          produced a biphasic concentrationdependent increase in          ethidium YOPRO and POPO uptake into the cells The          lagtime for a given concentration of MTX was the same          for each dye Fig Dand E first dashed lined but the          rate of dye uptake during the initial phase was inversely          proportional to molecular weight Furthermore at the          highest concentration of MTX examined the uptake of          ethidium YOPRO and POPO during the initial phase was          linear Fig D These results suggest that the first          phase reflects activation of a large pore ie          activation of COP that exhibits finite permeability for          each of the dyes tested and is distinct from the CaNSC          activated by MTX The molecular mechanisms responsible          for the delay between MTX addition and COP formation          ie vital dye uptake is unknown The delay which was          also observed in fibroblasts HEK cells and THP          monocytes    suggests that there may be several          biochemical steps between channel activation and COP          formation or that the concentration of a critical second          messenger must reach a threshold level before COP opens          This could explain the temperature sensitivity of vital          dye uptake previously noted for both MTX    and          purinergic receptorinduced    vital dye uptake          During the second phase dye uptake was allornothing          and once initiated the rate of dye uptake was independent          of dye molecular weight ie ethidium YOPRO and          POPO all enter the cell at the same time and at the          same rate for each concentration of MTX examined These          results suggest that the second phase of dye uptake is          related to cytolysis                          MTX induces LDH release          To test the hypothesis that the second phase of dye          uptake reflects a large change in membrane permeability          indicative of cytolysis the uptake of ethidium and          release of LDH Mw  Da were compared in parallel          experiments performed on the same batch of cells Fig           MTX again produced a biphasic increase in ethidium uptake          into the cells No LDH release was observed during the          first phase of ethidium uptake consistent with the          hypothesis that activation of COP occurs prior to release          of LDH Extracellular LDH was measurable  minutes after          MTX addition and subsequently increased in parallel with          the second phase of ethidium uptake These results          suggest that the second phase of dye uptake reflects a          loss of membrane integrity and provides an explanation          for the allornothing uptake of ethidium YOPRO and          POPO during this time frame Note that more than           of the cell associated LDH is released within  minutes          of MTX  nM addition For comparison we previously          reported that treatment of human skin fibroblasts for           minutes with  nM MTX caused release of  of          cellassociated LDH   Thus BAECs are particularly          sensitive to the cytolytic effects of MTX                          MTX produces similar changes in dye uptake in          single BAECs          The ethidium uptake experiments shown in Figs and          reflect the average response of the entire population of          BAECs within the cuvette It is possible that the          biphasic kinetics observed reflects at least in part          heterogeneity within the cell population To test this          hypothesis the effect of MTX was examined at the single          cell level using fluorescence microscopy Fig  BAECs          were sparsely seeded on glass coverslips and mounted on          the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope The          epifluorescence in each cell was measured using a CCD          camera and image analysis software The uptake of          ethidium by single BAECs as indicated by the change in          single cell fluorescence was biphasic Fig  The rate          of ethidium uptake during the first phase was          concentrationdependent but the second phase appeared to          be allornothing as was seen in the cuvette experiments          Likewise the delay between addition of MTX and the          second phase of ethidium uptake although variable from          cell to cell was concentrationdependent Thus the          overall profile observed at the single cell level          recapitulated the results obtained in the population          experiments One interesting difference between the          cuvette and single cell experiments is the time at which          the second phase begins As seen in Fig A the second          phase of dye uptake started approximately  minutes after          addition of  nM MTX At the single cell level the          second phase is clearly delayed and on average begins          approximately  minutes after  nM MTX addition Fig          D Although we do not know the reason for this          difference the population studies were performed on          dispersed cells in a cuvette whereas the single cell          studies were performed on BAECs attached to glass          coverslips Thus adherent cells may be resistant to the          gross changes in membrane structure that occurs during          the second phase of the response to MTX          Previous studies suggested that ATPinduced pores in          HEK cells heterologously expressing the PX            purinergic receptor were formed          either by dilation of the channel structure or by          aggregation of channels subunits   However these          studies relied on shifts in the reversal potential of          wholecell membrane currents Although this is a          sensitive technique for determining the time course of          pore formation these experiments do not eliminate the          possibility that COP and the PX channel are separate          entities In the present study the effect of MTX on          membrane permeability occurred in three distinct phases          The first phase reflects the activation of a CaNSC and a          large and rapid increase in Ca            i  After a short lag the activation          of COP allowed uptake of vital dyes into the cell and the          lag was independent of dye molecular weight At the          highest concentration of MTX examined dye uptake via COP          was linear and inversely proportional to molecular          weight These results suggest that COP does not increase          in size as a function of time as would be predicted by          the dilation or aggregation model Furthermore these          results strongly suggest that the CaNSC and the COP are          unique molecular structures                          MTX causes biphasic membrane blebbing          During the final phase of MTXinduced effects there          is a gross change in membrane integrity which allows          rapid uptake of vital dyes independent of dye molecular          weight This final phase is associated with release of          LDH which is indicative of oncotic cell death However          over the course of the single cell experiments we noticed          that BAECs treated with MTX not only accumulate vital          dyes but also undergo an enormous reorganization of the          plasma membrane to form giant membrane blebs An example          of MTXinduced membrane blebs is shown in the micrograph          in Fig which was obtained with Hoffman optics and          simultaneous brightfield and fluorescence illumination          After  minutes of MTX treatment at room temperature          YOPRO staining is prominent in the nucleus as expected          but is also visible in giant membrane blebs seen          surrounding each cell in the field of view At the          present time we do not know the composition of the          membrane that comprise each bleb or the structural          features of the cell that would allow evagination or          expansion of these membrane structures at specific sites          on the cell surface However blebbing presumably          requires a change in osmotic pressure within the cell and          so we reasoned that the blebs may be associated with the          second phase of vital dye uptake To test this          hypothesis we compared the morphological changes at the          cell surface with dye uptake at the single cell level          using timelapsed videomicroscopy A montage showing          brightfield and fluorescence image pairs is shown in Fig          and the complete timelapsed video sequence is shown in          Fig of the           Additional Data Files section           Montageavi As can be seen the first phase of ethidium          uptake is associated with the formation of membrane blebs          Fig  yellow arrows with an average diameter of          approximately  microns Blebs begin to form within           minutes of MTX addition to the bath solution and remain          at essentially a fixed size until approximately time           minutes As seen in the graphic presentation of          fluorescence in each cell Fig  bottom right bleb          formation correlates with the initial phase of dye          uptake From time  to  minutes the second phase of          dye uptake is observed and this phase is associated with          large bleb dilation Fig  red arrows These results          demonstrate that COP activity is associated with initial          bleb formation whereas LDH release ie cytolysis is          associated with dramatic bleb dilation          File  Montageavi          EB uptake and membrane blebbing in BAECs          BAECs on glass coverslips were perfused with HBS at          C A phase left and fluorescence right image pair          was obtained every  sec for  min MTX  nM was          added to the bath solution at time  min The timelapse

To better appreciate the dynamic nature of bleb          formation and to clearly observe the rapid nuclear          staining associated with bleb dilation we created          timelapsed movies in which the brightfield and          fluorescence images were merged into a single video Fig           EBaviand Fig  YOPROavi           Additional Data Files section By          setting your video viewer to continuously loop ie          auto replay and by focusing during each sequence on a          single cell within the field of view it can be seen that          fluorescence increases slowly during bleb formation but          that intense rapid dye staining occurs during the bleb          dilation phase As seen in Fig  and in each of these          videos MTXinduced blebbing results in an enormous          increase in membrane surface area which may represent          stretching of the membrane or an evagination of existing          caveolar structures associated with the plasmalemma of          endothelial cells Endothelial cells are also known to          have an extensive system of intracellular vesicles which          are used for transporting substances from the blood to          the interstitial space ie transcytotic vesicles          Thus membrane blebbing could reflect a massive          exocytotic event Why this would occur at selective sites          on the plasmalemma remains unknown Interestingly the          videos show several examples of blebs forming on the          surface of preexisting blebs during the dilation phase          Thus the structural elements that are required for          localized evagination of membrane appears to be          membraneassociated andor pulled from the cytoplasm          during the initial bleb formation Irrespective of the          exact mechanism the experiments reported in the present          study are the first to correlate MTXinduced vital dye          uptake with alterations in cell morphology

fibroblasts showed that          MTX had no effect on Ca            i  vital dye uptake or fura efflux          when the cells were challenged in the absence of          extracellular Ca   Although elevating Ca            i with ionomycin had no effect on          vital dye uptake preliminary experiments in which          fibroblasts were loaded intracellularly with the Ca          chelator BAPTA showed that MTXinduced responses were          significantly delayed suggesting that a rise in Ca            i is necessary but not sufficient for          MTXinduced COP formation To determine if extracellular          Ca is also required for MTXinduced membrane blebbing          changes in cell morphology were correlated with ethidium          uptake in the presence of Ca free extracellular buffer          Fig  the video showing the merged phase and          fluorescence images for this experiment is given in the           Additional Data Files section see          Cafreeavi MTX had no effect on BAECs incubated in Ca          free buffer Importantly no dye uptake or membrane          blebbing was observed for  min after the addition of          MTX to the bath solution Subsequent readmission of Ca          to the bath produced an increase in ethidium uptake          that again followed a biphasic time course virtually          identical to the profile observed when MTX was added to          cells incubated with normal Ca containing medium As          seen in Fig and the video dramatic membrane blebbing          and ethidium uptake is observed  min after readdition          of Ca to the bath Control experiments in which Ca          was removed and added back to BAECs in the absence of          MTX showed that these responses were dependent on the          presence of MTX ie no dye uptake or blebbing was          detected in the absence of MTX Fig  These results          demonstrate that extracellular Ca is necessary for          MTXinduced COP formation and membrane blebbing and          suggest that both responses require Ca influx and a          concomitant rise in Ca            i           File  Cafreeavi          Effect of Ca on

causes a specific        sequence of events ie a cell death cascade that is        triggered by the activation of CaNSC and a rise in Ca          i  This is followed by formation or        activation of COP which is correlated with the formation of        membrane blebs COP appears to be a unique molecule        associated with the plasma membrane and to have a fixed        pore geometry and conductance for each vital dye examined        Furthermore activation of COP provides the initial driving        force for osmotic swelling and bleb formation LDH release        indicative of the final phase of MTXinduced cell death is        associated with massive bleb dilation Although the        molecular mechanisms associated with each step in the cell        death cascade remain unknown MTX may prove to be an        important tool for understanding the biochemical and        biophysical links between channel activation COP        formation and membrane blebbing
