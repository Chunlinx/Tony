                    Background        The rate of reproductive development and the onset of        fertility are influenced by an array of environmental        factors that can be broadly grouped as physical        nutritional and social     Chief among social cues in        mammals are priming pheromones that can retard or        accelerate sexual development within constraints of factors        such as photoperiod and nutritional status of the        individual Subsequent to early studies that established        the pheromonal qualities of male urine to synchronize        estrous cycles of laboratory mice     sexual maturation        in female mice was shown to be accelerated by male        pheromones    and retarded by female pheromones            Pheromonal induction of first estrus in juvenile females        has been reported in a variety of other mammals including        prairie voles     pigs     and opossums            The gray shorttailed opossum          Monodelphis domestica  a small         g marsupial native to scrub forests of        southeastern Brazil provides new opportunities for study        of olfactory communication and pheromonal activation of        reproduction Females lack an estrous cycle and anestrous        adults are dependent upon direct contact with a        nonvolatile male pheromone for induction of estrus            Hormonal control of scentmarking and sexual behavior of        this species hereinafter opossum has been described in        some detail      Estrus is induced when females        nuzzle scentmarks from the androgendependent suprasternal        chest gland      Nuzzling delivers nonvolatile        chemical signals to the vomeronasal organ VNO    and        surgical removal of the VNO prevents induction of estrus by        scentmarks alone     although cautery ablation of the        VNO fails to prevent ovarian activation and ovulation in        females that are caged with adult males     While        anestrous adults are reliant on male pheromone for        reproductive activation spontaneous postlactational estrus        occurs in the absence of direct contact with male pheromone                   Reproductive activation and the onset of estrus are        monitored by cytology of the urogential sinus UGS             the sexual receptive organ in marsupials that lies        caudal to paired lateral vaginal canals LVC Fig  UGS        estrus estrus hereinafter is evident after  days of        pheromonal exposure Estrous females will not ovulate        unless paired with a male     but copulation is not        required to stimulate ovulation in females caged with males             Copulation typically occurs on the second night        of paring     Litters of about  young are born after        a day gestation and young are weaned at  weeks of        age        The onset of puberty in female opossums is strongly        influenced by pheromonal and perhaps other social cues        An earlier study found that juvenile females isolated from        all adult stimuli from  days of age grew to adult size         g but failed to express first estrus by  days            In contrast all females exposed directly to male        pheromones by cage switching reached first estrus at an        average age of  days and more than half of females        individually caged ie isolated from male scentmarks        and housed in a mixed sex colony expressed first estrus at         days on average This suggests that age at first        estrus varied from  to  days depending on pheromone        exposure     However body mass at first estrus was        remarkably close to  g in all females indicating that        puberty in opossums as in most mammals is dependent on        attainment of a threshold body mass More importantly        advancing the age of first estrus by pheromone exposure was        accompanied by an apparent acceleration of somatic growth        such that this critical body mass was reached at a younger        age        In the present study we compared body somatic growth        and ovarian activity in females given daily nuzzling        contact with male scentmarks exposed with that in females        individually caged in a mixed sex colony but isolated from        direct contact with male scentmarks unexposed The study        tested the hypothesis that females exposed to male        scentmarks will have greater somatic growth and their        ovaries will contain developing antral follicles in greater        numbers and larger in size than those found in ovaries from        females of the same age exposed only to the ambient social        stimuli of the colony Circulating levels of estradiol and        mass of reproductive organs were also measured as evidence        of reproductive activation                    Materials and Methods                  Animals          Juvenile female opossums n   were weaned at           days and individually housed at  days in polycarbonate          cages      cm in a mixedsex colony in an          American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory          Animal Careapproved facility in the Botany and Zoology          Building at The Ohio State University The animal room          was maintained on a LD cycle and room temperature          was C food Fox Reproduction Food Milk          Specialties Co New Holstein WI and acidified water          pH  were provided           ad libitum  Males n   proven          breeders and females were caged individually and held on          different shelving racks separated by at least  m          Incidental transfer of pheromones in male scentmarks to          females was avoided by handling females and their cages          prior to handling males or male cages All procedures          relating to care and use of opossums in this study were          described in protocols approved by the Institutional          Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee at The Ohio          State University                          Experimental Design          This study utilized three timepoints identified in          previous studies as key stages in pheromonal induction of          first estrus in juvenile females           days  the youngest age recorded for pheromonal          induction of estrus           days  the average age of first estrus in          juveniles exposed to male pheromone           days  the recognized age for first use in routine          breeding and litter production ie the age at which          most females will respond to male pheromone with          expression of estrus          Unexposed females were isolated from direct contact          with males and male scentmarks and randomly selected for          necropsy at  n    n    n   and           days n   Exposed females were given continuous          access to adult male scentmarks from  days and randomly          selected for necropsy at  n   and  days n            The  day old group provided baseline data for          assessment of development in both unexposed and exposed          animals Data from unexposed females killed at            and  days provided a basis for evaluating the effects          of male pheromone on somatic growth and reproductive          activation during pheromonal induction of first estrus in          exposed females Exposed females were only examined          through  days because we expected they would have          attained sexual maturity and expressed first estrus by          then     making them developmentally comparable to          unexposed females at  days          Scentmarks containing estrusinducing pheromone were          collected by rubbing  sides of a ml glass vial on the          suprasternal gland of an unrelated male The vial was          then inverted and screwed into a stand and placed daily          in each females cage     Females actively nuzzle          the scentmarked vials particularly during the first           minutes of exposure     UGS smears were collected          with a salinemoistened cotton swab every  days              Body mass was recorded when smears were collected and          growth rates gweek were calculated for each age and          treatment group as the mass gained between the beginning          of exposure day  and necropsy                          Blood and Organ Collection and Analyses          Blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture at          necropsy and the plasma stored at C Final body mass          and total body length were also recorded at this time          Ovaries uteri and LVC were removed trimmed of          connective tissue weighed and fixed in phosphate          buffered formalin Fixed ovaries were embedded in          Paraplast R cut into  m serial sections mounted on          slides and stained with Lillies Allochrome stain          All histological sections of both ovaries collected at          necropsy were examined for antral follicles which were          recognized by the presence of one or more fluidfilled          cavities lined with granulosa cells Atretic follicles          were identified by the presence of  or more pyknotic          nuclei in granulosa cells leukocytes in the antrum and          loosening or degeneration of the mural layer of granulosa          cells Antral follicles not exhibiting these obvious          indications of atresia were classified as developing The          proportion of total antral follicles per female that was          atretic was used as an index of atresia atresia          hereinafter The diameter of each antral follicle was          recorded as the average of  perpendicular diameters          measured at X with an ocular reticle in the section          containing the oocyte nucleolus or the largest oocyte          nucleus Mean diameters of developing and atretic          follicles per individual animal were the basis for          comparison between groups          Estradiol concentrations in plasma were measured with          a RIA validated for female opossum plasma in our          laboratory     The antiserum a gift from RL          Butcher West Virginia University Morgantown was raised          in a ewe against  estratriendiol           hemisuccinatehuman serum albumin Cross reactivity of          the antiserum was limited to  with estrone and           with estriol     Sensitivity of the assay is           pg l intra and interassasy coefficients of          variation averaged  and  respectively          Variation in body length body mass gain in body          mass number size and atresia of antral follicles          plasma estradiol concentrations and organ mass were          analyzed using mixed models method     Y           ij    T           i  e           ij where Y           ij is the dependent variable  is the          overall mean T           i is the fixed effect of the i          thtreatment i   and e           ij is the residual error          Heterogeneity of subclass error variance was assessed          using a likelihood ratio test     The model was          fitted with Proc Mixed of SAS V A mixed model          allows for the direct representation of heterogeneity of          variance hence the name Generalized LeastSquares  GLS          and therefore does not require transformation of the          dependent variable to restore homogeneity of variance as          is necessary for ordinary leastsquares methods Linear           a priori contrasts were used for          comparing  unexposed vs exposed at  days           unexposed vs exposed at  days  unexposed at           vs unexposed at the three older ages  unexposed at           vs unexposed at the two older ages and           unexposed at  vs  days Differences in the size          distribution of follicles were tested with a Chisquared          test For all analyses the level of significance was P            Mean values are expressed  standard error of          the mean SEM                            Results        Three of four exposed females expressed estrus by         days a fourth was in proestrus and the fifth remained        anestrous The mean age at estrus was    days and        exposed females weighed more than unexposed females at both         days and  days P   Table  None of the        unexposed females expressed estrus during the study even        though  weighed more than  g at  days        Body mass and total body length increased with age in        both exposed and unexposed females but growth was faster        in females exposed to male pheromone from  days Exposed        females gained more body mass than unexposed females           vs    gweek at  days P   Table         Growth curves for the  females monitored until        necropsy at  days revealed more rapid growth in exposed        than in unexposed females after  days with differences        in body mass evident P   by  days Fig                The number of developing antral follicles per female        exceeded those that were atretic in all but three females        in the study The average diameter of developing and        atretic follicles within groups was similar data not        shown Overall follicular atresia averaged           and did not differ with age or pheromone exposure P          Therefore data are reported for developing antral        follicles only Follicles apparently first reach the antral        stage in unexposed juvenile females near  days because        antral follicles were observed in only two of the four        females examined at this age One of these females had         atretic follicles and the other had  developing follicles        The average number of developing antral follicles in        unexposed females increased to    at  days P          and to    at  days but did not differ        by pheromone exposure within these age groups Table                Mean follicular diameter in unexposed females increased        between  and  days P   but overall  to         days the agerelated increase in size was relatively        small Pheromone exposure was associated with increased        follicle size at both  and  days P   Table         Also the size distribution of follicles in exposed        females at  days was markedly different from that        observed in other groups Fig   were  m or        larger Plasma estradiol concentrations were low          pgml in most females Mean concentrations per group        varied from    to    pgml but did not        differ by age or pheromone exposure The highest        concentration  pgml was measured in plasma from an        estrous female with  large   m developing        follicles        The effect of male pheromone on sexual maturation was        most apparent in the increased size of uteri and LVC        collected from exposed females Mean uterine mass was        higher in exposed than unexposed females at  days P          and the LVC of exposed females were larger at        both  and  days Figs                      Discussion        This study demonstrates that exposure of juvenile        females to pheromone from a single source the male        suprasternal gland accelerates ovarian follicular        development and first estrus One of the more interesting        findings of this study is that the size distribution of        developing follicles in unexposed females remained        relatively stable from  through  days seldom        exceeding  m in diameter Fig  The pattern was        distinctly different in exposed females at  days wherein        nearly half  of the follicles exceeded  m in        diameter and  were larger than  m similar to the        largest antral follicles  mm in superovulated        opossums     This increased size of developing        follicles in exposed opossums is similar in magnitude to        that seen in the preGraafian follicles of rats between        diestrus and proestrus     Prepubertal pine voles        exposed to male urine also showed an increase in the number        of largest follicles but with no change in atresia            as in our study        Juvenile females in this study were exposed to male        scentmarks from the age of  days but they did not        express first estrus until  days much longer than the        average of  days required for pheromonal induction of        estrus in adults In other respects however first estrus        in juveniles is similar to pheromoneinduced estrus in        adults Plasma concentrations of estradiol in opossums are        low  pgml during anestrus and are elevated         pgml only during estrus     Mean plasma estradiol        concentrations as high as  pgml have been reported in        estrous females     but a gradual increase in        circulating estradiol during pheromonal induction of estrus        in opossums has not been described Therefore it is not        surprising that estradiol concentrations measured in single        samples collected at necropsy did not correlate with        reproductive status in this experiment The one female        killed at estrus however did have the highest plasma        estradiol concentration as well as the heaviest        reproductive organs        Evidence of the stimulatory effect of male pheromone on        sexual maturation of juvenile females was seen most clearly        in the large increase in mass of the LVC and uteri of        exposed females at  days and although not reflected in        plasma estradiol levels classic estrogenic effects of male        pheromone exposure are evident in the increased mass of        these reproductive organs Juvenile and adult prairie voles        exhibit a similar response to male stimuli For example a        onehour exposure to an adult male stimulated within         hours increases in uterine mass that lasted for  days or        more     Uterine mass also remained elevated  days        after estrus in the two metestrous females in this study        even though their plasma estradiol concentrations were low        at the time of necropsy        The mean age at estrus    days although based        on a small sample n   is very similar to that recorded           in our previous study    in which females        were exposed to multiple potential sources of male        pheromone eg urine feces and scentmarks through cage        switching The increased growth rate in females suggested        in our previous experiment was confirmed in the present        study Some of the increase in body mass might be due to        estrogenstimulated edema as adult females experience a         gain in body mass during induced estrus            However an increased growth rate gwk was evident as        early as  days in exposed females who would not be        expected to express first estrus or the associated changes        in body composition until approximately  days Table                Sixty grams is confirmed as a critical body mass for        induction of estrus in juvenile female opossums as        identified in our previous study     Somatic growth and        attainment of a threshold body mass or energy reserves are        known requisites for puberty in many mammals including the        tammar wallaby     sheep      and several        species of rodents     but these factors seldom act        independently of environmental factors such as photoperiod            or social cues      The opossum is unusual        in this regard because social cues in the form of male        pheromone appear to stimulate both somatic growth and        ovarian activation Moreover this growth response marks a        difference between pheromonal acceleration of puberty in        opossums and that which is welldocumented in mice wherein        females paired with males ovulate at a lower body mass          g than that of isolated females   g                    Our findings provide the critical descriptive groundwork        for further investigations into the physiological pathways        and underlying mechanisms involved in pheromonal regulation        of somatic and sexual maturation in opossums The fact that        pheromonal stimulation of both follicular and somatic        growth was evident as early as  days makes it difficult        to say with any certainty whether pheromones affect these        phenomena by independent or interacting pathways Pheromone        exposure activates the hypothalamopituitarygonadal HPG        axis as evidenced in increased plasma LH in opossums           and voles     and ovarian activation and subsequent        steroid hormone production could stimulate somatic growth        indirectly by effects on growth hormone and fat deposition        or alterations in metabolism and appetite Alternatively        in addition to stimulating the HPG axis male pheromones        could act centrally to alter neuroendocrine control of        growth and metabolism eg via growth hormone releasing        hormone thyroid hormone releasing hormone or        corticotrophin releasing hormone Future studies that        control for estrogenic effects of ovarian activation food        availability and body growth during the relatively        protracted period of pheromonal induction of first estrus        offer promise for extending our understanding of the role        of social and environmental signals on body growth and        sexual maturation
